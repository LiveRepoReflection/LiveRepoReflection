Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a wide range of programming skills in Python.

## Project Name

`OptimalTaskAssignment`

## Question Description

You are managing a large-scale distributed task processing system. This system receives a continuous stream of tasks, each characterized by a unique ID, a deadline, a processing time (duration), and a set of resource requirements (CPU, Memory, Network bandwidth).

The system consists of a fleet of worker nodes, each with varying resource capacities and geographical locations. Each worker node incurs a cost per unit time for processing a task. This cost can vary based on the worker's location, hardware, and energy consumption.

Your goal is to design and implement an algorithm to optimally assign incoming tasks to worker nodes to minimize the overall cost, while ensuring that all task deadlines and resource requirements are met.

**Specifics:**

*   **Tasks:** Represented as a tuple: `(task_id, deadline, duration, cpu, memory, network)` where:
    *   `task_id` is a unique integer.
    *   `deadline` is an integer representing the absolute time by which the task must be completed.
    *   `duration` is an integer representing the processing time required for the task.
    *   `cpu`, `memory`, and `network` are integers representing the CPU cores, memory (in MB), and network bandwidth (in Mbps) required by the task, respectively.
*   **Worker Nodes:** Represented as a tuple: `(worker_id, cpu_capacity, memory_capacity, network_capacity, cost_per_unit_time)` where:
    *   `worker_id` is a unique integer.
    *   `cpu_capacity`, `memory_capacity`, and `network_capacity` are integers representing the CPU cores, memory (in MB), and network bandwidth (in Mbps) available at the worker node, respectively.
    *   `cost_per_unit_time` is a float representing the cost of using the worker node for one unit of time.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   A worker node can only process one task at a time.
    *   A task must be assigned to exactly one worker node.
    *   The resources required by a task cannot exceed the available resources on the assigned worker node.
    *   A task must be completed by its deadline. The start time of the task plus its duration must be less than or equal to the task's deadline.
*   **Input:**
    *   A list of tasks: `tasks = [(task_id1, deadline1, duration1, cpu1, memory1, network1), (task_id2, deadline2, duration2, cpu2, memory2, network2), ...]`
    *   A list of worker nodes: `workers = [(worker_id1, cpu_capacity1, memory_capacity1, network_capacity1, cost_per_unit_time1), (worker_id2, cpu_capacity2, memory_capacity2, network_capacity2, cost_per_unit_time2), ...]`
    *   Current system time: `current_time` (integer).
*   **Output:**
    *   A dictionary representing the optimal task assignment: `{task_id: worker_id, ...}`.  Return an empty dictionary if no feasible assignment exists.
*   **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the total cost of processing all tasks. The total cost is the sum of (worker node's cost per unit time * task duration) for all assigned tasks.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   **Infeasible Assignments:** The problem might not always have a feasible solution.  Your algorithm should handle cases where no assignment is possible that satisfies all constraints.
*   **Large Number of Tasks and Workers:** The number of tasks and worker nodes can be significant (e.g., thousands). The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle this scale.
*   **Tight Deadlines:** Tasks may have very tight deadlines, requiring careful scheduling.
*   **Varying Resource Requirements:** Tasks may have vastly different resource requirements, making some workers more suitable than others.
*   **Cost Trade-offs:** Some workers might be cheaper but have lower capacity, requiring a trade-off between cost and feasibility.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism to handle task preemption and migration (moving a task from one worker to another) to further optimize resource utilization.
*   Consider the geographical distribution of worker nodes and the network latency between them and the data source for the tasks. Introduce a network cost factor in the optimization.
*   Implement a dynamic task assignment strategy that can adapt to changes in task arrival rates, worker node availability, and resource contention.

This problem requires a combination of careful algorithmic design, efficient data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

## Project Name

`Decentralized Social Network Analytics`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building an analytics engine for a decentralized social network. This network is structured as a peer-to-peer system where each user maintains their own data and connection information. There is no central database or authority. User data is stored in a distributed hash table (DHT), where keys are user IDs and values are serialized representations of user profiles and their connections.

Specifically, the social network has the following properties:

*   **Users:** Each user has a unique ID (represented as a UUID string).
*   **Connections:** Each user maintains a list of IDs of other users they are directly connected to (friends). These connections are unidirectional.
*   **Data Storage:** User profiles and connection data are stored in a DHT. Given a user ID, you can retrieve the serialized data representing that user's profile and connections.
*   **Serialization:** User data is serialized using a custom format. A user's data is a dictionary containing two keys: `"profile"` (a dictionary of user profile information) and `"connections"` (a list of UUID strings representing friend IDs). The profile dictionary can contain arbitrary key-value pairs.

Your goal is to implement several analytics functions on this decentralized social network, given the ability to query the DHT for user data. Due to the distributed nature of the network, you must consider efficiency and minimize the number of DHT queries.

Specifically, you need to implement the following analytics functions:

1.  **`get_mutual_friends(user_id_1, user_id_2, dht_query_function)`:** Returns a set of user IDs representing the mutual friends of `user_id_1` and `user_id_2`. This function should minimize DHT queries. The function will use a `dht_query_function` that takes a user ID as input and returns the user's serialized data (a dictionary as described above), or `None` if the user is not found.

2.  **`find_shortest_path(start_user_id, end_user_id, dht_query_function)`:** Returns a list of user IDs representing the shortest path (minimum number of hops) between `start_user_id` and `end_user_id` in the social network. If no path exists, return an empty list. Optimize for minimal DHT queries.

3.  **`detect_community(user_id, dht_query_function, threshold)`:** Identifies a community around a given `user_id`. A community is defined as a set of users where each member has at least `threshold` number of connections within the community. The function should return a set of user IDs representing the community. This function should balance the need for accuracy with the need to minimize DHT queries. It should be reasonably efficient even with large networks.

**Constraints:**

*   The social network can contain millions of users.
*   The number of connections per user can vary significantly.
*   DHT queries are expensive and should be minimized.
*   Your solution should be efficient in terms of both time and memory complexity, considering the scale of the network.
*   The `dht_query_function` is the only way to access user data. You cannot assume any global knowledge of the network.
*   Error handling: The `dht_query_function` might return `None` if a user is not found in the DHT. Your code should handle these cases gracefully.
*   The `threshold` in `detect_community` should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the maximum number of connections a user can have.

**Example `dht_query_function`:**

```python
import uuid
import random

def dummy_dht_query(user_id):
    # Simulate DHT lookup.  Replace with actual DHT interaction in a real system.
    # This is just for demonstration purposes.

    user_id = uuid.UUID(user_id) #Ensuring UUID type

    # Simulate some users not existing
    if random.random() < 0.1:
        return None

    profile = {"name": f"User {user_id}", "age": random.randint(18, 65)}
    connections = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in range(random.randint(0, 10))] # Simulate 0-10 connections

    data = {"profile": profile, "connections": connections}
    return data
```

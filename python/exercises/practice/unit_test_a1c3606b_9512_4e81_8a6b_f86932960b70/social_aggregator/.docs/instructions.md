## Problem: Decentralized Social Network Aggregator

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a system to aggregate and rank posts from a decentralized social network. This network consists of multiple independent servers (nodes), each hosting a subset of the total users and posts.  Each post can optionally link to other posts within the network, creating a complex web of interconnected content. The goal is to build a system that can efficiently fetch posts from these distributed nodes, resolve inter-post dependencies, and rank them based on a combination of factors, ultimately providing a unified feed to a user.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Network Structure:** The decentralized network is composed of `N` nodes. Each node maintains a list of users and their posts. Nodes can communicate with each other directly, but there is no central authority or global registry of users or posts.

2.  **Post Representation:** A post is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:
    *   `'post_id'`: A unique string identifier for the post within the entire network.
    *   `'author_id'`: A string identifier for the author of the post.
    *   `'content'`: A string containing the text of the post.
    *   `'timestamp'`: An integer representing the post's creation time (Unix timestamp).
    *   `'links'`: A list of `post_id` strings representing links to other posts in the network. These links may reside on different nodes.
    *   `'node_id'`: An integer representing the node on which the post resides.

3.  **Node API:** Each node exposes a simple API with the following functionalities:
    *   `get_posts_by_user(user_id)`: Returns a list of post dictionaries authored by `user_id` on that node.
    *   `get_post(post_id)`: Returns the post dictionary for the given `post_id` on that node, or `None` if the post doesn't exist.

4.  **Ranking Algorithm:** Posts are ranked based on the following criteria, in order of importance:
    *   **Timestamp:** Newer posts rank higher.
    *   **Link Depth:** Posts with a higher link depth rank higher.  The link depth of a post is defined as the length of the longest chain of links originating from that post. For example, if post A links to post B, and post B links to post C, the link depth of post A is 2.  If a post has no outgoing links, its link depth is 0.  Cycles in the link graph should be handled gracefully to prevent infinite loops.
    *   **Author Popularity:** Posts from more popular authors rank higher. Author popularity is defined as the total number of posts authored by that user across the entire network.

5.  **System Requirements:**

    *   **Efficiency:** The system must be able to fetch and rank posts efficiently, even when dealing with a large number of nodes and posts. Consider both time and space complexity.
    *   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of nodes and users without significant performance degradation.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to node failures. If a node is unreachable, the system should continue to function, possibly with reduced accuracy or completeness.
    *   **Dependency Resolution:** The system must correctly resolve inter-post dependencies, even when posts are located on different nodes. Cycles in the dependency graph must be handled.
    *   **Completeness:** The system should strive to retrieve as many relevant posts as possible, given the constraints of efficiency and fault tolerance.
    *   **Handle Large Datasets:** The total size of posts can be very large, so the solution should avoid loading all data into the memory.

**Task:**

Implement a function `aggregate_and_rank_posts(user_ids, node_apis)` that takes a list of `user_ids` to follow and a list of `node_apis` (functions representing the API of each node) as input. The function should return a list of post dictionaries, sorted according to the ranking criteria described above.

**Constraints:**

*   `N` (number of nodes) can be up to 100.
*   The number of `user_ids` can be up to 1000.
*   Each user may have up to 1000 posts across the network.
*   The number of links per post can be up to 100.
*   The maximum link depth is limited to 10 to prevent excessively long dependency chains.
*   Network latency and node availability are unpredictable. You should implement appropriate timeouts or retry mechanisms to handle potential node failures.
*   Minimize external library usage. You are allowed to use standard Python libraries.

**Example:**

```python
def get_posts_by_user(user_id):
    # Mock implementation for a node
    if user_id == "user1":
        return [{"post_id": "post1", "author_id": "user1", "content": "...", "timestamp": 1678886400, "links": ["post2"], "node_id": 0}]
    else:
        return []

def get_post(post_id):
    # Mock implementation for a node
    if post_id == "post2":
        return {"post_id": "post2", "author_id": "user2", "content": "...", "timestamp": 1678886300, "links": [], "node_id": 0}
    else:
        return None

node_apis = [
    {"get_posts_by_user": get_posts_by_user, "get_post": get_post}
]

user_ids = ["user1"]

ranked_posts = aggregate_and_rank_posts(user_ids, node_apis)
# Expected output (order may vary depending on tie-breaking):
# [{'post_id': 'post1', 'author_id': 'user1', 'content': '...', 'timestamp': 1678886400, 'links': ['post2'], 'node_id': 0}]
```

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly aggregate and rank posts according to the specified criteria.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
*   Scalability: The solution should be able to handle a large number of nodes and users.
*   Fault Tolerance: The solution should be resilient to node failures.
*   Code Clarity: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Adherence to Constraints: The solution must adhere to the specified constraints.

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills.

## Project Title

**Asynchronous Distributed Task Scheduler with Dependency Resolution**

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed task scheduler. This scheduler should be able to accept tasks, manage their dependencies, and execute them asynchronously across a cluster of worker nodes.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Task Definition:** Each task is represented by a unique ID (string), a function to be executed (represented as a string containing the function name â€“ you do *not* need to actually execute Python code dynamically), and a list of task IDs that represent its dependencies. A task cannot be started until all its dependencies have completed successfully.

2.  **Asynchronous Execution:** Tasks should be executed asynchronously, meaning the scheduler should not block while waiting for a task to complete. Use Python's `asyncio` library for concurrency.

3.  **Distributed Execution (Simulated):** Instead of setting up a real distributed system, simulate multiple worker nodes using `asyncio` tasks. Each worker node has a limited capacity to execute tasks concurrently (e.g., a maximum number of concurrent tasks).

4.  **Dependency Resolution:** The scheduler must correctly resolve task dependencies. It should only schedule a task for execution when all its dependencies have been successfully completed. If a dependency fails, the dependent task and all tasks that depend on it should be marked as failed and not executed.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The scheduler must handle task failures gracefully. If a task fails (simulated by raising an exception), the scheduler should log the error, mark the task as failed, and prevent any tasks that depend on it from being executed.

6.  **Prioritization (Optional, but highly encouraged):** Implement task prioritization. Tasks can be assigned a priority level (e.g., high, medium, low). The scheduler should prioritize tasks with higher priority when scheduling them for execution. Assume priorities are integers where a lower number means higher priority (e.g., 1 is higher priority than 2).

7.  **Cycle Detection:** The scheduler should detect and handle circular dependencies. If a cycle is detected, it should raise an exception and prevent the execution of any tasks involved in the cycle.

8.  **Scalability Considerations:** While this is a simulation, keep scalability in mind. The scheduler should be designed in a way that it could potentially be scaled to handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes. Consider how you would manage task state, distribute tasks across nodes, and handle communication between nodes in a real-world distributed system.

**Input:**

*   A dictionary representing the tasks. The keys are task IDs (strings), and the values are dictionaries containing the following keys:
    *   `function`: A string representing the function to be executed (e.g., "process\_data").
    *   `dependencies`: A list of task IDs that this task depends on.
    *   `priority`: An integer representing the task's priority. Lower numbers indicate higher priority.

*   The number of worker nodes to simulate (integer).
*   The maximum concurrent tasks per worker node (integer).
*   A dictionary to simulate task execution time, the key is the function name, and the value is time in seconds. If a function is not in this dictionary, assume it takes 1 second to execute.
*   A dictionary to simulate the task failure. The key is the task id and the value is true if it fails, false otherwise. Default failure rate is 0 (no task fails).

**Output:**

*   A dictionary containing the final status of each task. The keys are task IDs (strings), and the values are strings representing the status of the task ("success", "failed", "skipped").
* The scheduler should log all task executions and failures to a file named "scheduler.log".

**Constraints:**

*   The number of tasks can be large (up to 10,000).
*   The number of worker nodes can be up to 100.
*   Task execution times can vary significantly.
*   The scheduler must be efficient in terms of resource utilization and task completion time.
*   The solution should be well-documented and easy to understand.
*   Use appropriate logging to track task execution and errors.

**Example Input:**

```python
tasks = {
    "task1": {"function": "fetch_data", "dependencies": [], "priority": 1},
    "task2": {"function": "clean_data", "dependencies": ["task1"], "priority": 2},
    "task3": {"function": "analyze_data", "dependencies": ["task2"], "priority": 3},
    "task4": {"function": "generate_report", "dependencies": ["task3"], "priority": 4},
    "task5": {"function": "email_report", "dependencies": ["task4"], "priority": 5},
    "task6": {"function": "backup_data", "dependencies": [], "priority": 2}
}
num_workers = 4
max_concurrency_per_worker = 2
execution_times = {"fetch_data": 2, "analyze_data": 3}
task_failures = {"task3": True}

```

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The scheduler correctly executes tasks based on their dependencies and priority.
*   Efficiency: The scheduler efficiently utilizes resources and minimizes task completion time.
*   Fault Tolerance: The scheduler handles task failures gracefully and prevents dependent tasks from being executed.
*   Scalability: The scheduler is designed in a way that it could potentially be scaled to handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes.
*   Code Quality: The code is well-documented, easy to understand, and follows best practices.
*   Cycle Detection: The scheduler correctly detects and handles circular dependencies.

This problem requires a solid understanding of asynchronous programming, dependency management, and system design principles. It also requires careful consideration of edge cases and potential performance bottlenecks. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:**  Distributed Transaction Orchestrator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction orchestrator.  Imagine a system where multiple independent services (simulated within a single program) need to perform operations that must either all succeed or all fail together. This is a classic distributed transaction problem.

Your solution should simulate the following scenario:

1.  **Services:**  Represented by Python classes. Each service has a unique ID and a `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` method. The `prepare()` method attempts to reserve resources or perform a preliminary action.  The `commit()` method finalizes the operation, and the `rollback()` method undoes the changes made by `prepare()`.  `prepare()` should return `True` on success, and `False` on failure. `commit()` and `rollback()` should return `True` on success and `False` on failure.

2.  **Transactions:** A transaction involves a set of services and a coordinator.

3.  **Coordinator:**  Your orchestrator acts as the coordinator. It receives a list of services participating in a transaction. It must implement the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol to ensure atomicity (all or nothing).

**Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:**

*   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):**
    *   The coordinator sends a `prepare()` request to all participating services.
    *   Each service attempts to prepare. If successful, it replies "vote commit" (represented by `True`). If it fails, it replies "vote abort" (represented by `False`).
    *   The coordinator waits for responses from all services or a timeout.

*   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback Phase):**
    *   If all services voted to commit (all `prepare()` calls returned `True`), the coordinator sends a `commit()` request to all services.
    *   If any service voted to abort (any `prepare()` call returned `False`), or if a timeout occurred, the coordinator sends a `rollback()` request to all services.
    *   Each service executes the requested action (`commit()` or `rollback()`).

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Asynchronous Simulation:** Simulate asynchronicity by introducing random delays (using `time.sleep()`) in the `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods of each service.  The delays should be different for each service and each method call to mimic real-world network latency variations.

*   **Service Failure:**  Introduce a probability of failure for each service's `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods.  This probability should be configurable for each service instance. Failures should be simulated by the method returning `False`.

*   **Timeout:**  The coordinator must implement a timeout mechanism for the prepare phase. If a service doesn't respond within a specified timeout duration, the coordinator should assume the service has failed and initiate a rollback.

*   **Idempotency:** The `commit()` and `rollback()` methods should be idempotent.  That is, calling them multiple times should have the same effect as calling them once. This is crucial because in a real distributed system, messages can be lost or duplicated.

*   **Logging:**  Implement a logging mechanism to record the actions taken by the coordinator and each service, including the time of each event, the service ID, and the action performed (prepare, commit, rollback) along with success or failure.

*   **Deadlock Prevention/Detection (Bonus - very difficult):**  Design the services in a way that if they access shared resources, it minimizes or eliminates the possibility of deadlocks during the prepare phase. If deadlock cannot be prevented, implement a simple deadlock detection mechanism and initiate a rollback.

*   **Optimization:**  The coordinator should be able to handle a large number of services (e.g., hundreds) efficiently.  Consider using asynchronous programming (e.g., `asyncio`) to improve concurrency and reduce the overall transaction time.

**Input:**

*   A list of service instances.
*   A timeout duration for the prepare phase.
*   A dictionary defining the probability of failure for each service's `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods.

**Output:**

*   `True` if the transaction committed successfully (all services prepared and committed).
*   `False` if the transaction rolled back (due to any service failing to prepare or a timeout).
*   A log of all actions taken by the coordinator and each service.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the 2PC implementation.
*   Handling of service failures and timeouts.
*   Idempotency of `commit()` and `rollback()` methods.
*   Efficiency and scalability of the coordinator.
*   Clarity and completeness of the logging.
*   Bonus points for deadlock handling.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, error handling, and efficient algorithm design. Good luck!

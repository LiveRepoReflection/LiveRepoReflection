## Question: Optimal Route Planner with Time-Dependent Traffic

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal route planner for a delivery service operating in a large city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are intersections and edges are roads. Each road has a time-dependent travel time function, meaning the travel time on a road varies depending on the time of day you start traversing it.

Given a starting intersection, a destination intersection, and a starting time, your program must find the fastest route to the destination.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph. The keys are intersection IDs (integers), and the values are dictionaries representing outgoing edges. Each outgoing edge dictionary has the following structure: `{destination_intersection: travel_time_function}`.
*   `travel_time_function`: A callable (e.g., a Python function) that takes a time (in minutes from the start of the day, represented by an integer) as input and returns the travel time (in minutes) for that road at that time. The travel time function is assumed to be periodic with a period of 1440 minutes (24 hours).
*   `start_intersection`: The ID of the starting intersection (integer).
*   `destination_intersection`: The ID of the destination intersection (integer).
*   `start_time`: The starting time in minutes from the start of the day (integer).

**Output:**

*   A tuple containing:
    *   The minimum travel time (in minutes) to reach the destination intersection (float).
    *   The optimal route as a list of intersection IDs, starting with the start intersection and ending with the destination intersection.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 10,000 intersections and 50,000 roads).
*   Travel time functions can be complex and involve non-linear calculations (e.g., trigonometric functions, piecewise functions). You should assume calling the travel_time_function is relatively expensive and optimize your approach to minimize its usage.
*   You must handle the case where no route exists between the start and destination intersections. In this case, return `(float('inf'), [])`.
*   Your solution must be efficient and should aim for a time complexity significantly better than a naive brute-force approach. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms for graph traversal and optimization.
*   The travel time function must be correctly handled. The travel time for a road segment should be calculated based on the *arrival time* at the start node of that road.
*   Implement your solution in Python.

**Example:**

```python
def example_travel_time_function(time):
    # Simulate rush hour: slower travel time during certain hours
    hour = (time // 60) % 24
    if 7 <= hour < 9 or 17 <= hour < 19:
        return 10  # Increased travel time during rush hour
    else:
        return 5   # Normal travel time

graph = {
    1: {2: example_travel_time_function, 3: example_travel_time_function},
    2: {4: example_travel_time_function},
    3: {4: example_travel_time_function},
    4: {}
}

start_intersection = 1
destination_intersection = 4
start_time = 480  # 8:00 AM

# Expected output (approximate):
# (20.0, [1, 2, 4]) or (20.0, [1, 3, 4])

```

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Does your solution always produce the correct output, including handling edge cases and constraints?
*   **Efficiency:**  How quickly does your solution run, especially for large graphs? Minimize the number of calls made to the `travel_time_function`.
*   **Code Clarity:** Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

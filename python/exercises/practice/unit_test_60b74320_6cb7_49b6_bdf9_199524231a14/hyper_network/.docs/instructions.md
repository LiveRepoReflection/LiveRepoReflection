`HyperSocialNetwork`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable system to model and analyze a hyper-social network. Unlike traditional social networks where connections are binary (user A follows user B), this network models complex interactions between groups of users.

**Data Model:**

*   **Users:** Each user is represented by a unique integer ID.
*   **Groups:** A group is a set of users.  Each group is identified by a unique integer ID.
*   **Interactions:** An interaction represents a relationship between two or more groups. An interaction is defined by a set of group IDs and a timestamp representing when the interaction occurred. Interactions are directed: the order of groups in the interaction matters. If group A interacts with group B at time T, it implies a directed relationship from A to B at that time.  Multiple interactions can occur between the same sets of groups, each with its own timestamp.

**System Requirements:**

Implement a system that supports the following operations efficiently:

1.  **`create_user(user_id)`:** Creates a new user with the given `user_id`.  Return `True` if successful, `False` if the user ID already exists.
2.  **`create_group(group_id, user_ids)`:** Creates a new group with the given `group_id` containing the set of `user_ids`. Return `True` if successful, `False` if the group ID already exists or if any of the user IDs do not exist.
3.  **`record_interaction(group_ids, timestamp)`:** Records a new interaction between the groups specified by `group_ids` at the given `timestamp`.  The order of group IDs in `group_ids` defines the direction of the interaction. Return `True` if successful, `False` if any of the `group_ids` do not exist or the timestamp is invalid (see constraints).
4.  **`get_interacting_groups(group_id, start_time, end_time)`:**  Returns a list of group IDs that have interacted *with* the given `group_id` (i.e., where `group_id` is the *target* of the interaction) within the specified time range (`start_time` inclusive, `end_time` exclusive). The list should be sorted in ascending order of group ID.
5.  **`get_interaction_path(start_group_id, end_group_id, max_length, start_time, end_time)`:**  Finds a path of interactions from `start_group_id` to `end_group_id` within the specified `max_length` (maximum number of interactions in the path) and time range (`start_time` inclusive, `end_time` exclusive). The path should be a list of group IDs representing the sequence of groups in the interaction path.  If multiple paths exist, return the shortest one (fewest interactions). If multiple shortest paths exist, return any one of them. Return an empty list if no path exists. Note that a path is a sequence of group IDs `[group1, group2, ..., groupN]` such that there's an interaction from `group1` to `group2`, from `group2` to `group3`, and so on, within the specified time range.

**Constraints:**

*   `user_id` and `group_id` are non-negative integers.
*   `timestamp`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are non-negative integers representing time in seconds since epoch.
*   `start_time <= end_time`
*   Timestamps for interactions must be strictly increasing.  If a new interaction is recorded with a timestamp less than or equal to the timestamp of the most recent interaction, the operation should return `False`.
*   `max_length` is a positive integer.
*   The number of users and groups can be very large (up to 10<sup>9</sup>).
*   The number of interactions can also be very large (up to 10<sup>9</sup>).
*   You should optimize for query performance (`get_interacting_groups` and `get_interaction_path`).
*   Memory usage should be reasonable.  Avoid storing redundant data.
*   Your solution should be thread-safe. Multiple operations can be called concurrently.

**Example:**

```python
# Example Usage (Illustrative - your code should handle much larger datasets)
system = HyperSocialNetwork()
system.create_user(1)
system.create_user(2)
system.create_group(10, [1, 2])
system.create_group(20, [1])
system.create_group(30, [2])

system.record_interaction([10, 20], 100)  # Group 10 interacts with Group 20 at time 100
system.record_interaction([20, 30], 150)  # Group 20 interacts with Group 30 at time 150
system.record_interaction([10, 30], 200)  # Group 10 interacts with Group 30 at time 200

interacting_groups = system.get_interacting_groups(30, 0, 300) # Groups interacting with group 30 between time 0 and 300
print(interacting_groups) # Output: [10, 20]

path = system.get_interaction_path(10, 30, 3, 0, 300) # Find interaction path from group 10 to group 30 with max length 3 between time 0 and 300
print(path) # Output: [10, 30] or [10, 20, 30]
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using appropriate data structures (graphs, trees, hash maps, etc.) to efficiently store and retrieve information about users, groups, and interactions.
*   Think about how to optimize graph traversal for finding interaction paths.  Breadth-first search (BFS) might be a suitable approach.
*   Pay close attention to time complexity. Avoid brute-force solutions that will time out for large datasets.
*   Consider using indexing or other techniques to speed up queries based on timestamps.
*   Think about how to handle concurrent access to the data structures to ensure thread safety.  Locks or other synchronization mechanisms might be necessary.
*   Consider a sparse matrix representation if interaction density is low.

This problem challenges you to design a robust and efficient system for modeling and analyzing complex interactions in a hyper-social network, considering both performance and scalability. Good luck!

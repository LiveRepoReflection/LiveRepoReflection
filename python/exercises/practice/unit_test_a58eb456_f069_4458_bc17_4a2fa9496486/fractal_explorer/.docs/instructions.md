## Question Description

You are tasked with building a fractal explorer that can dynamically generate and render fractal images based on user-defined parameters.  The system needs to handle complex fractal calculations, manage memory efficiently, and provide a smooth interactive experience for exploring different regions and levels of detail within the fractal.

Specifically, you need to implement a system that:

1.  **Calculates Fractal Values:** Implement the core fractal generation algorithm.  You must support the Mandelbrot set. The fractal is defined by iterating the function *z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c*, where *z* and *c* are complex numbers. The point *c* belongs to the Mandelbrot set if the magnitude of *z* remains bounded after iterating the function a certain number of times.

2.  **Dynamically Renders Regions:** The user can specify a rectangular region in the complex plane to visualize. This region is defined by its top-left corner (real and imaginary parts), width, and height.  The system must map pixel coordinates of the rendered image to complex number coordinates within the specified region.

3.  **Supports Zooming and Panning:** The user can zoom in and out of the fractal by changing the width and height of the rendered region. They can pan by changing the top-left corner. The system must efficiently re-calculate and re-render the fractal for the new region.

4.  **Implements Iteration Limit Scaling:** The user can specify a maximum number of iterations to perform when calculating whether a point belongs to the Mandelbrot set.  Increase the maximum iteration count by zoom in to the fractal. The maximum iteration count should scale logarithmically with the zoom factor. This means the iteration limit should increase smoothly as the user zooms in and decrease smoothly as they zoom out. The zoom factor can be defined as the ratio of the initial width to the current width.

5.  **Optimizes Performance:** Fractal calculations can be computationally expensive. Implement optimizations to improve rendering speed.  Consider techniques such as:

    *   **Caching:** Cache previously calculated fractal values to avoid redundant computations.  Implement a least-recently-used (LRU) cache with a limited size.  Use the complex number *c* as the key.
    *   **Vectorization (optional):** Explore using libraries like NumPy to vectorize calculations for improved performance.
    *   **Parallelization (optional):** Explore using multithreading or multiprocessing to parallelize the calculations for different pixels.

6.  **Handles Edge Cases and Large Values:** Your implementation must handle edge cases such as:

    *   Division by zero (when mapping pixels to complex numbers).
    *   Very large or very small values that can occur during fractal calculations, potentially leading to overflows or underflows. Handle these gracefully without crashing.
    *   Extreme zoom levels which can lead to precision issues. Try to mitigate such issues.

7.  **Provides Memory Efficiency:** Large fractal images, especially at high zoom levels and iteration counts, can consume significant memory.  Optimize your implementation to minimize memory usage. Be mindful of the size of your cache. Avoid storing unnecessary data.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be implemented in Python.
*   You can use standard Python libraries (e.g., `math`, `functools`).  The use of `numpy` and `threading` and `multiprocessing` are allowed but completely optional.
*   The rendering component is outside of the scope of the problem. Focus on the fractal calculation and data management aspects.  You should provide a method to retrieve the calculated fractal values for a given region as a 2D list (or NumPy array if using NumPy). Each item in the 2D list represents how many iterations it took to determine if the given point diverged or not.
*   The cache size must be limited to a reasonable value (e.g., 10,000 entries).
*   The initial width and height of the region should be approximately 3 (e.g., -2 to 1 on the real axis, -1.5 to 1.5 on the imaginary axis).
*   The initial iteration limit should be at least 50 and scale appropriately when zooming.

**Input:**

*   `real_start`: The real part of the top-left corner of the region.
*   `imaginary_start`: The imaginary part of the top-left corner of the region.
*   `width`: The width of the region in the complex plane.
*   `height`: The height of the region in the complex plane.
*   `image_width`: The width of the output image in pixels.
*   `image_height`: The height of the output image in pixels.
*   `max_iterations`: The initial maximum number of iterations.

**Output:**

*   A 2D list (or NumPy array) of integers, where each element represents the number of iterations it took for the corresponding point to escape (or reach the maximum iteration limit if it didn't escape).

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, data structure selection, optimization techniques, and careful attention to detail. Good luck!

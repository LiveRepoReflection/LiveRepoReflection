## Question: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Conflict Resolution

**Description:**

Design and implement a distributed, transactional key-value store. The store consists of `N` nodes (where `N` can be a large number, e.g., 1000). Clients can connect to any node in the cluster to perform read and write operations. The system must support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, specifically focusing on handling concurrent writes to the same key from different clients.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Data Distribution:** The key-value pairs should be distributed across the `N` nodes using a consistent hashing mechanism. This ensures even data distribution and minimal data movement during node failures or additions.

2.  **Transactions:** Implement transaction support, allowing clients to group multiple read and write operations into a single atomic unit. Transactions must guarantee atomicity (all operations succeed or none do), consistency (data remains valid after the transaction), isolation (concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other), and durability (committed data is not lost).

3.  **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a robust conflict resolution mechanism to handle concurrent writes to the same key from different transactions. You **must** implement a versioned concurrency control scheme, specifically using vector clocks. Each key should store its data along with its vector clock. When a client attempts to write to a key, the system must compare the client's vector clock with the key's vector clock. If there's a conflict (i.e., concurrent updates), the system must:

    *   Detect the conflict.
    *   Attempt to automatically resolve the conflict (e.g., using a last-write-wins strategy based on the vector clock, or by merging the conflicting values if the data type allows, with preference given to the client with the higher version in the vector clock).
    *   If automatic resolution is not possible (e.g., values are incompatible or the conflict is too complex), the transaction should be aborted and the client notified.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to node failures. Data should be replicated across multiple nodes to ensure durability and availability. You must define a replication factor `R` (where `R < N`). Use primary-backup replication or chain replication. The system should automatically handle failover to backup nodes in case of primary node failures.

5.  **Scalability:** The system should be horizontally scalable. Adding more nodes to the cluster should increase the capacity and throughput of the store.

6.  **Performance:**  Optimize the system for low latency and high throughput. Consider caching strategies, batching of operations, and efficient data serialization/deserialization.  Writes have a stricter latency requirement.

7.  **Constraints:**

    *   Assume a network with potential message loss and delays.
    *   Assume nodes can fail (crash-stop failures).
    *   The key-value store should support basic data types (integers, strings, lists).
    *   The data size for each key is limited (e.g., 1MB).
    *   The number of concurrent transactions can be high.
    *   Nodes can have limited memory capacity.
    *   Assume a maximum transaction size (number of operations).

8.  **Evaluation Criteria:**

    *   Correctness (ACID properties, conflict resolution).
    *   Performance (latency, throughput).
    *   Fault tolerance (ability to handle node failures).
    *   Scalability (ability to scale horizontally).
    *   Code quality (readability, maintainability).
    *   Efficiency (memory usage, CPU usage).

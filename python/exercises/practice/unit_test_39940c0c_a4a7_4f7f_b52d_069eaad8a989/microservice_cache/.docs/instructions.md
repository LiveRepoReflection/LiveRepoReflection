## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication in a Microservice Architecture

**Problem Description:**

You are designing the communication layer for a large-scale microservice architecture.  You have `N` microservices, each identified by a unique integer ID from 0 to `N-1`. These services need to communicate with each other to fulfill various user requests.

Direct service-to-service communication is possible, but due to network latency and service load, direct calls can become inefficient, especially for frequently accessed services or when dealing with cascading requests. To improve performance, you are introducing a caching layer.

You are provided with a list of `Q` queries. Each query is represented as a tuple `(source_service_id, target_service_id, data)`.  The goal is to process these queries in order, optimizing the communication between services using a combination of direct calls and caching.

**Caching Strategy:**

You have a distributed cache that can store communication results between service pairs. The cache has a limited capacity `C`, measured in units of data.  Each cached result occupies space equal to the length of the `data` string associated with the query.

Your system maintains a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for the cache.  When a new item needs to be added to the cache and there is insufficient space, the least recently accessed item(s) are evicted until enough space is available.

**Communication Rules:**

1.  **Cache Hit:** If a query `(source_service_id, target_service_id, data)` is present in the cache, return the cached data immediately.  This counts as a cache hit and updates the LRU order.
2.  **Cache Miss:** If a query is not in the cache:
    *   Simulate a direct call from `source_service_id` to `target_service_id` to obtain the result.  For simplicity, assume the result of the direct call is always the reversed string of the `data` provided in the query.
    *   Return the reversed string.
    *   Attempt to cache the query and its result (the reversed string). If there is enough space, add the query and its result to the cache. If not, evict the least recently used items until enough space is available, then add the query and its result.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of microservices (an integer).
*   `C`: The cache capacity (an integer).
*   `Q`: A list of tuples, where each tuple is `(source_service_id, target_service_id, data)` representing a query. `source_service_id` and `target_service_id` are integers between 0 and `N-1` (inclusive), and `data` is a string.

**Output:**

A list of strings, where each string is the result of processing the corresponding query in the input list `Q`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `1 <= C <= 10^6`
*   `1 <= len(Q) <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= source_service_id < N`
*   `0 <= target_service_id < N`
*   `1 <= len(data) <= 1000`
*   All strings will contain only ASCII characters.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the given input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider the time complexity of cache lookups, insertions, and evictions.  A naive solution with poor time complexity will likely time out.

**Example:**

```
N = 3
C = 10
Q = [
    (0, 1, "hello"),
    (1, 2, "world"),
    (0, 1, "hello"),
    (2, 0, "python"),
    (1, 2, "world")
]

Output:
["olleh", "dlrow", "olleh", "nohtyp", "dlrow"]
```

**Explanation of Example:**

1.  **(0, 1, "hello")**: Cache miss.  Direct call returns "olleh". Cache "hello":"olleh". Cache usage: 10.
2.  **(1, 2, "world")**: Cache miss. Direct call returns "dlrow". Cache "world":"dlrow". Cache usage: 10 + 5 = 15. Since C = 10, the cache is full. But the query is new, so we proceed as if the cache had unlimited space for this query (evicting will be handled if the next query requires it).
3.  **(0, 1, "hello")**: Cache hit. Returns "olleh".
4.  **(2, 0, "python")**: Cache miss. Direct call returns "nohtyp". Cache "python":"nohtyp". Cache usage: 15 + 6 = 21.  Cache is over capacity. Remove "hello":"olleh" (size 5).  Cache usage: 21 - 5 = 16.  Still over capacity. Remove "world":"dlrow" (size 5). Cache usage 16 - 5 = 11. Still over capacity. This can happen. Just proceed as if it has enough space, and eviction will only happen when the next query comes.
5.  **(1, 2, "world")**: Cache hit. Returns "dlrow".

Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Python coding problem. Here it is:

## Question: Optimal Multi-Source Shortest Paths with Dynamic Edge Weights

### Question Description

You are given a directed graph representing a communication network. The graph has `N` nodes, numbered from 0 to `N-1`, and `M` edges. Each edge `(u, v)` has an initial weight `w`.

You are also given `K` source nodes. Your task is to find the shortest path from *any* of the `K` source nodes to *every* other node in the graph. This is a multi-source shortest path problem.

However, the challenge is that the edge weights are **dynamic**. You will receive a series of `Q` updates. Each update consists of an edge `(u, v)` and a new weight `new_w`. After *each* update, you need to recalculate the shortest paths from the `K` source nodes to all other nodes.

Specifically, your program should implement a function that:

1.  **Takes as input:**
    *   `N`: The number of nodes in the graph.
    *   `M`: The number of edges in the graph.
    *   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)` representing the edges and their initial weights.
    *   `sources`: A list of integers representing the source nodes.
    *   `Q`: The number of weight updates.
    *   `updates`: A list of tuples `(u, v, new_w)` representing the edge weight updates.

2.  **For each update:**
    *   Apply the update to the graph's edge weights.
    *   Calculate the shortest path from *any* source node to *every* other node in the graph.
    *   Store the shortest path distances for all nodes in a list.

3.  **Return:** A list of lists, where each inner list represents the shortest path distances from the sources to all nodes *after* each update. If a node is unreachable from any source node, its distance should be represented as `float('inf')`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `1 <= M <= 5000`
*   `1 <= K <= N`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `1 <= w, new_w <= 1000`
*   `1 <= Q <= 100`
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   The graph may not be strongly connected.
*   Multiple edges between the same pair of nodes are not allowed.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

The solution needs to be efficient enough to handle the given constraints.  A naive approach that recalculates shortest paths from scratch after each update may not pass all test cases. Consider algorithms and data structures that can efficiently handle dynamic updates and shortest path calculations. Aim for a time complexity significantly better than O(Q * N * M) where possible.  Think about leveraging previous calculations.

**Example:**

```python
N = 4
M = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 4), (1, 3, 7)]
sources = [0, 1]
Q = 2
updates = [(0, 1, 5), (2, 3, 1)]

# Expected Output (Illustrative - actual values will depend on your algorithm)
# [
#  [0, 5, 6, 11],  # Distances after update (0, 1, 5)
#  [0, 5, 6, 7]   # Distances after update (2, 3, 1)
# ]
```

This problem combines graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization considerations, making it a challenging LeetCode Hard level problem. The dynamic nature of the edge weights forces solvers to think beyond standard shortest path algorithms and consider efficient update mechanisms. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level, incorporating several of the elements you suggested.

## Problem: Decentralized Social Network Routing

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building the core routing mechanism for a new decentralized social network. This network consists of users (represented by unique string IDs) connected through bidirectional trust relationships. Unlike traditional social networks with a central server, this network's user data and connection information are distributed across the users themselves.

Each user maintains a local view of the network, containing:

1.  **Their own User ID.**
2.  **A list of trusted User IDs.** (These are users they directly trust.)
3.  **The ability to query a trusted user for *their* local view of the network.** (This is simulated, you do not need to use any API but use a given function.)

The goal is to implement an efficient algorithm to find the *shortest trust path* between any two users in the network, given only a starting user and a target user. The "shortest trust path" is defined as the path with the fewest number of hops between users, following only trust relationships.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Decentralized Nature:** You cannot assume a global view of the network. You must discover the network structure by recursively querying trusted users for their connections.
2.  **Network Size:** The network can be very large (potentially millions of users). Naive search algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) without proper optimization will likely time out.
3.  **Trust Cycles:** The network may contain cycles of trust (e.g., A trusts B, B trusts C, and C trusts A). Your algorithm must handle cycles gracefully to prevent infinite loops.
4.  **Query Cost:** Each query to a trusted user is considered an expensive operation. Minimize the number of queries required to find the path.
5.  **Path Reconstruction:** You need to return the actual trust path (an ordered list of user IDs) if a path exists. If no path exists between the two users, return an empty list.
6.  **Performance:** The solution must be optimized for both time and space complexity, considering the decentralized and potentially large-scale nature of the network. Consider that the querying process is expensive, so reducing the querying is important.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the starting user and target user are the same, or where the starting user does not trust anyone.

**Input:**

*   `start_user_id` (str): The User ID of the starting user.
*   `target_user_id` (str): The User ID of the target user.
*   `get_trusted_users(user_id)` (function): A function that takes a User ID as input and returns a `list` of User IDs that the input user trusts. This function simulates the act of querying a remote user for their trusted connections. (Important: This function is provided to you and does *not* count towards your code's line count or complexity. You should not modify this function).

**Output:**

*   `path` (list of str): A list of User IDs representing the shortest trust path from the `start_user_id` to the `target_user_id`. Return an empty list (`[]`) if no path exists.

**Example:**

```python
# Assume the following network structure:
# A trusts B, C
# B trusts D, E
# C trusts F
# D trusts G

def get_trusted_users(user_id):
    if user_id == "A":
        return ["B", "C"]
    elif user_id == "B":
        return ["D", "E"]
    elif user_id == "C":
        return ["F"]
    elif user_id == "D":
        return ["G"]
    elif user_id in ["E", "F", "G"]:
        return []
    else:
        return []

start_user = "A"
target_user = "G"

# Expected output: ["A", "B", "D", "G"]
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using an informed search algorithm like A\* search or Dijkstra's algorithm, adapted for a decentralized environment.
*   Implement a caching mechanism to store the local views of users you have already queried. This can significantly reduce the number of calls to `get_trusted_users`.
*   Think about how to represent the "cost" or "distance" between users in the network.
*   Be very careful about handling cycles in the graph. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid getting stuck in loops.

This problem combines graph traversal, optimization, and handling of decentralized data, making it a challenging and realistic scenario for a programming competition. Good luck!

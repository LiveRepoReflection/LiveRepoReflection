## Question Description

You are building a distributed system for processing a high-volume event stream. Events are generated across a cluster of `N` nodes. Each node produces events with a timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch), a category (string), and a value (integer). Your system must aggregate these events to provide real-time analytics.

Specifically, you need to implement a system that efficiently calculates the **median event value** for each category within a sliding time window of `W` milliseconds.  This calculation must be performed in a distributed manner and needs to be resilient to node failures and network latency.

**Input:**

The system receives event data from `N` nodes in the form of tuples: `(timestamp, category, value, node_id)`. `timestamp` is a long integer, `category` is a string, `value` is an integer, and `node_id` is an integer representing the source node (0 to N-1). The events are not guaranteed to arrive in chronological order, and there might be duplicates.

**Output:**

For each category, the system should continuously output the median event value within the sliding window `W`. The output should be in the form of `(category, median_value, timestamp_of_calculation)`. The `timestamp_of_calculation` represents the time when the median was calculated. The system must calculate the median as close to real-time as possible.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Distributed Processing:** The aggregation must be distributed across multiple machines to handle the high event volume. You are free to design a suitable distributed architecture.
2.  **Real-time Performance:** The system must provide median values with minimal latency.  The median calculation should be triggered *approximately* every `T` milliseconds.
3.  **Sliding Window:** The median should be calculated only for events within the last `W` milliseconds.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to node failures. If a node fails, the system should continue to operate, potentially with reduced accuracy until the node recovers or is replaced.
5.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing event volumes and numbers of nodes.
6.  **Approximate Median:** Calculating the exact median in a distributed, real-time environment is computationally expensive. Therefore, you are allowed to compute an *approximate median* using appropriate data structures and algorithms, such as t-digests or similar techniques. Justify your choice of approximation and provide an error bound (e.g., within X% of the true median).
7.  **Memory Constraints:** Each node has limited memory. Design your data structures to be memory-efficient.
8.  **Network Latency:** Account for network latency between nodes.
9.  **Event Duplicates:** The input event stream may contain duplicate events. Your solution needs to handle these gracefully.
10. **Handling late events:** Handle late events (events that arrive after the window has passed). You should either discard them or incorporate them into past calculations if possible.

**Parameters:**

*   `N`: Number of nodes (e.g., 10, 100, 1000)
*   `W`: Sliding window size in milliseconds (e.g., 1000, 5000, 10000)
*   `T`: Calculation frequency in milliseconds (e.g., 100, 500, 1000). It should be much smaller than `W`.
*   Error bound for the approximate median (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%)

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Accurate median calculation within the specified error bound.
*   Performance: Low latency and high throughput.
*   Scalability: Ability to handle a large number of nodes and events.
*   Fault Tolerance: Resilience to node failures.
*   Code Quality: Clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
*   Justification: Clear explanation of the chosen algorithms and data structures, including the rationale for the approximation technique and error bound analysis.
*   Handling of edge cases: Does the solution gracefully handle empty categories, zero values, and negative values?

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems, data structures, algorithms, and approximation techniques. Good luck!

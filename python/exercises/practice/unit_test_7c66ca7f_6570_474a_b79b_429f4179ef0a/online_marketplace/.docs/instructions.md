Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and involve a good mix of algorithmic thinking, data structures, and optimization.

### Question Description

You are building the backend for an online marketplace that facilitates trading of unique, non-fungible digital assets.  The marketplace needs to support a high volume of concurrent transactions and complex search queries.  Each asset has a unique ID (a large integer), a price (in a fictional cryptocurrency called "Coins"), and a set of string-based attributes (e.g., "color:blue", "rarity:legendary", "type:sword").

Your task is to implement a system that efficiently handles the following operations:

1.  **`add_asset(asset_id: int, price: int, attributes: List[str])`**: Adds a new asset to the marketplace.  The `asset_id` is guaranteed to be unique.

2.  **`update_price(asset_id: int, new_price: int)`**:  Updates the price of an existing asset.

3.  **`remove_asset(asset_id: int)`**: Removes an asset from the marketplace.

4.  **`search(query: str, sort_by: str, limit: int)`**:  Performs a search for assets matching the given query.

    *   `query` is a string containing attribute filters.  The query can contain multiple attribute filters separated by "AND".  Each attribute filter is in the form "attribute:value". For example: "color:blue AND rarity:legendary". The search should only return assets that match **all** specified filters.  If the query is empty, it should return all assets.
    *   `sort_by` is a string specifying the field to sort the results by.  It can be either "price" (sort by price in ascending order) or "asset_id" (sort by asset ID in ascending order).
    *   `limit` is an integer specifying the maximum number of results to return.

5.  **`bulk_load(assets: List[Tuple[int, int, List[str]]])`**:  Efficiently loads a large number of assets into the marketplace.  Each tuple in the list represents an asset in the format `(asset_id, price, attributes)`. This operation should be significantly faster than adding assets individually using `add_asset` repeatedly.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The marketplace is expected to handle millions of assets and thousands of concurrent requests.
*   **Efficiency:** Search queries should be optimized for speed.  The `bulk_load` operation must be highly efficient.
*   **Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures to support efficient insertion, deletion, updating, and searching.  Consider the trade-offs between different data structures.
*   **Concurrency:** The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests correctly.
*   **Memory Usage:**  Minimize memory usage while maintaining performance.  Consider techniques like indexing and lazy loading.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases such as:
    *   Searching for attributes that don't exist.
    *   Updating or removing assets that don't exist.
    *   Empty queries.
    *   Invalid sort criteria.
    *   Duplicate attributes within a single asset.
*   **Optimization:** Aim for the following performance characteristics:
    *   `add_asset`, `update_price`, `remove_asset`: Should ideally be O(log N) or better on average, where N is the number of assets.
    *   `search`: Should be significantly faster than O(N) for queries with multiple attribute filters, leveraging indexing.
    *   `bulk_load`: Should be significantly faster than N * O(log N), where N is the number of assets to load.
*   **Pythonic Code:** Write clean, readable, and well-documented Python code.

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles.  It encourages thinking about trade-offs and optimizing for real-world performance. Good luck!

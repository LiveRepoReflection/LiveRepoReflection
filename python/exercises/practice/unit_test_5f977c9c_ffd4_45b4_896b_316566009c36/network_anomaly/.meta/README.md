# Network Anomaly Detection

This project implements a near real-time anomaly detection system for network traffic. It identifies suspicious traffic patterns based on deviations from historical baselines.

## Features

- Real-time processing of network traffic data streams
- Adaptive baseline updates using a sliding window approach
- Z-score based anomaly scoring
- Memory-efficient design for handling large-scale networks
- Handles edge cases such as new connections and zero standard deviation scenarios

## Usage

### Question Description

You are designing a distributed database system. The system consists of `N` data centers, each with its own storage capacity and data. Due to network latency and reliability concerns, it's crucial to replicate data across multiple data centers. However, replicating *all* data to every data center is prohibitively expensive.

Each data center `i` has a storage capacity `capacity[i]` and currently holds a set of data objects.  There are `M` distinct data objects in the system.  For each data object `j`, you know which data center(s) initially hold it (represented as a bitmask).

The system needs to meet a **durability requirement**: for each data object, there must be at least `K` distinct data centers holding a copy of that object.

Your task is to determine the **minimum cost** to replicate data objects across the data centers to satisfy the durability requirement. The cost of replicating a data object `j` to a data center `i` is `cost[i][j]`.  You cannot remove data objects from the data centers that already contain them.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 50` (Number of data centers)
*   `1 <= M <= 500` (Number of data objects)
*   `1 <= K <= N` (Durability requirement)
*   `1 <= capacity[i] <= 10^9` (Storage capacity of data center `i`)
*   `1 <= cost[i][j] <= 10^6` (Cost of replicating data object `j` to data center `i`)
*   Each data object's initial locations are guaranteed to be valid (at least one data center has it).
*   It is guaranteed that the total size of each data object is 1 (in other words, replicating 100 data objects to the same data center will cost 100 unit of capacities)

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of data centers.
*   `M`: The number of data objects.
*   `K`: The durability requirement.
*   `capacity`: A list of integers of length `N`, where `capacity[i]` is the storage capacity of data center `i`.
*   `initial_locations`: A list of integers of length `M`. `initial_locations[j]` is a bitmask representing the data centers that initially hold data object `j`.  The `i`-th bit (from right to left, 0-indexed) being set to 1 indicates that data center `i` initially holds data object `j`.
*   `cost`: A 2D list of integers of size `N x M`, where `cost[i][j]` is the cost of replicating data object `j` to data center `i`.

**Output:**

*   The minimum cost to replicate data to satisfy the durability requirement.  If it's impossible to satisfy the requirement, return `-1`.

**Example:**

Let's say we have:

*   `N = 3`
*   `M = 2`
*   `K = 2`
*   `capacity = [5, 5, 5]`
*   `initial_locations = [0b001, 0b010]`  (Data object 0 is initially in data center 0; Data object 1 is initially in data center 1)
*   `cost = [[1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 3]]`

The optimal solution would be to replicate data object 0 to data center 1 (cost 2) and data object 1 to data center 0 (cost 2). This would make both data objects available in two data centers and satisfy the requirement. The total cost is 4.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The solution must be efficient, ideally with a time complexity better than O(N\*M\*K\*something_large).  Solutions that brute-force all possible combinations will likely time out.  Consider efficient algorithms and data structures.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Consider cases where a data object already meets the durability requirement.
*   Consider cases where no solution exists (e.g., not enough capacity or even if all capacities are used, the `K` value cannot be meet).
*   Consider cases where `K = 1`.
*   Consider cases where the costs are very high, pushing integer calculations to their limits.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

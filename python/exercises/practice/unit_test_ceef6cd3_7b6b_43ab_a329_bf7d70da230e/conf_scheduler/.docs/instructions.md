## Question: Optimal Conference Scheduling with Speaker Dependencies and Venue Constraints

### Question Description

You are tasked with scheduling a prestigious international conference. The conference has a set of talks, each given by a different speaker. The goal is to maximize the number of talks that can be scheduled while adhering to several complex constraints.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Speaker Dependencies:** Some speakers have dependencies. Speaker A depends on Speaker B if Speaker A requires knowledge presented by Speaker B. In this case, Speaker B's talk MUST be scheduled before Speaker A's talk. These dependencies are provided as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent speakers and edges represent dependencies.

2.  **Venue Capacity:** The conference has multiple venues, each with a limited capacity. Each talk requires a specific venue with adequate capacity. Multiple talks can occur simultaneously in different venues, but a single venue can only host one talk at any given time slot.

3.  **Speaker Availability:** Each speaker has a specific time slot availability represented as a list of time intervals. The talk MUST be scheduled within one of these available time intervals. Time intervals are represented by their start and end times.

4.  **Talk Duration:** Each talk has a fixed duration. The talk MUST fully fit within its scheduled time slot within the speaker's availability.

5.  **Maximization Goal:** Your primary objective is to maximize the number of talks that can be scheduled. If multiple schedules achieve the same maximum number of talks, prioritize schedules that minimize the total "idle time" of all venues. Idle time for a venue is the sum of the lengths of time intervals when the venue is not hosting any talk during the conference period (from the earliest start time to the latest end time of all scheduled talks).

6.  **No Preemption:** Once a talk is scheduled, it cannot be interrupted or moved.

**Input:**

*   `speakers`: A dictionary where keys are speaker IDs (integers) and values are dictionaries containing:
    *   `availability`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a time interval (start\_time, end\_time) in integer format.
    *   `talk_duration`: An integer representing the duration of the speaker's talk.
    *   `venue_requirement`: An integer representing the ID of the venue required for the talk.
*   `venue_capacities`: A dictionary where keys are venue IDs (integers) and values are their capacities (integers).
*   `speaker_dependencies`: A list of tuples, where each tuple (speaker\_A, speaker\_B) indicates that speaker\_A depends on speaker\_B.
*   `speaker_capacities`: A dictionary where keys are speaker IDs (integers) and values are number of audience members that will attend to the talk.
*   `conference_start_time`: An integer representing the starting time of the conference.
*   `conference_end_time`: An integer representing the ending time of the conference.

**Output:**

A list of tuples, where each tuple (speaker\_ID, start\_time) represents a scheduled talk. The list should be sorted by `start_time` in ascending order.

**Example:**

Imagine a small conference with 2 speakers, 1 venue, and a single dependency. Your solution must schedule as many talks as possible while respecting venue constraints, speaker availability, speaker dependencies, talk durations, and aiming to minimize total venue idle time.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Correctness:** Ensuring all constraints are met.
2.  **Maximization:** Achieving the maximum possible number of scheduled talks.
3.  **Optimization:** Minimizing total venue idle time when multiple schedules achieve the same maximum number of talks.
4.  **Efficiency:** Handling large inputs (many speakers, venues, and dependencies) within a reasonable time limit.

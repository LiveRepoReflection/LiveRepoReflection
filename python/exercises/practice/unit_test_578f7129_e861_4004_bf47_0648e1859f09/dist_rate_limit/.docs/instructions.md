## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter

### Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter. Your system should be able to handle a high volume of requests and enforce rate limits across a cluster of servers.

**Scenario:** Imagine you are building a popular online service, and you need to protect your backend resources from being overwhelmed by malicious users or poorly written clients. You decide to implement a rate limiter to restrict the number of requests a user can make within a certain time window.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Core Functionality:** The system must limit the number of requests a user can make per unit of time (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
2.  **Distributed Environment:** The rate limiter should work correctly even when requests are handled by multiple servers in a cluster.
3.  **User Identification:** The system must be able to identify users uniquely. Assume each request contains a unique `user_id`.
4.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing traffic.
5.  **Concurrency:** The system must handle concurrent requests efficiently.
6.  **Efficiency:** Minimize latency and resource consumption.
7.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to failures of individual components.
8.  **Configuration:** The rate limit (requests/time window) should be configurable without requiring a redeployment.
9.  **Atomic Operations:** Ensure that incrementing and checking the request count is done atomically to prevent race conditions.
10. **Time Window Management:** Implement a mechanism to reset the request count for each user after the time window expires.
11. **Handling Exceeded Requests:** When a user exceeds the rate limit, the system should return an appropriate error message (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests).
12. **Memory Management:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially if you have a large number of users.  Consider strategies to evict inactive users from memory to prevent OOM errors.
13. **Graceful Degradation:** If a component of the rate limiter fails, the system should attempt to continue functioning, perhaps by temporarily disabling rate limiting for a subset of users. However, you are not expected to implement a full circuit breaker pattern.
14. **Time Synchronization:** Address potential issues arising from clock skew in a distributed environment.

**Input:**

*   A `user_id` (string or integer).
*   A timestamp of the request (you can assume this is provided, or generate it within your solution).

**Output:**

*   `True` if the request is allowed (within the rate limit).
*   `False` if the request is rejected (rate limit exceeded).

**Constraints:**

*   Implement the solution in Python.
*   You can use external libraries for caching, data storage, or distributed coordination (e.g., Redis, Memcached, ZooKeeper, etcd), but justify your choice.
*   Focus on the core rate limiting logic and data structures. Avoid implementing a full-fledged web server or client.
*   Consider the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms in terms of performance, memory usage, and complexity.
*   The time window can be assumed to be in seconds.
*   Assume the number of total users can be very large.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement different rate limiting algorithms (e.g., Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window Counter, Sliding Window Log, Sliding Window Counter).  Explain the pros and cons of each.
*   Implement dynamic rate limiting based on system load (e.g., reduce the rate limit if the server is overloaded).
*   Add monitoring and alerting to the rate limiter (e.g., track the number of rejected requests, the average latency, etc.).

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test advanced Python skills:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Consensus

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a distributed transaction consensus algorithm for a simplified banking system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each representing a bank server. A transaction involves transferring funds between two accounts, which might reside on different nodes.

Your system must ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, even in the face of network partitions and node failures.  Implement a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol *with optimizations* to handle concurrent transactions.

Specifically, you need to:

1.  **Model the System:**  Simulate `N` bank nodes, each holding a dictionary representing account balances. Assume account IDs are strings.

2.  **Implement 2PC:** Implement the coordinator and participant roles of the 2PC protocol.

3.  **Concurrency Handling:** Design your system to handle multiple concurrent transactions.  Consider implementing a locking mechanism to prevent race conditions.

4.  **Failure Handling:**  Simulate node failures and network partitions.  Your protocol should be able to recover from these failures, ensuring that transactions either fully commit or fully rollback.  Assume a simple timeout mechanism for detecting failures. If a node doesn't respond within a reasonable time, it's considered failed.

5.  **Logging:** Implement a basic logging mechanism at each node to record transaction states (prepared, committed, aborted). This is critical for recovery.

6.  **Optimization:** Implement at least one optimization to reduce the latency of the 2PC protocol.  For example, consider a "read-only optimization" where read-only participants bypass the prepare phase. Or suggest another optimisation.

7.  **Scalability:** While the problem is not a full-blown distributed system, your solution should be designed with scalability in mind.  Consider how your approach would scale to a larger number of nodes and transactions.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of bank nodes (e.g., 5).
*   `transactions`: A list of transactions. Each transaction is a dictionary with the following keys:
    *   `from_account`: The account ID to debit.
    *   `to_account`: The account ID to credit.
    *   `amount`: The amount to transfer.
*   `node_distribution`: A dictionary mapping account IDs to the node ID where the account resides (0 to N-1).
*   `failure_events`: A list of events simulating node failures and network partitions.  Each event is a tuple `(time, event_type, node_id)`, where `time` is a timestamp, `event_type` is either "fail" or "partition", and `node_id` is the ID of the affected node.  For partitions, you can assume it isolates the node from all other nodes.

**Output:**

*   A boolean value indicating whether all transactions were successfully processed (committed or rolled back) despite potential failures.
*   The final state of the account balances across all nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   Implement the system in a single Python file.
*   Minimize external dependencies.  Standard Python libraries are allowed, but avoid using specialized distributed systems frameworks.
*   Focus on correctness and robustness over raw performance.
*   Explain your chosen optimization and its rationale.
*   Provide clear comments in your code.
*   The solution should be able to handle a reasonable number of nodes (up to 10) and transactions (up to 100) within a reasonable time (a few seconds).
*   Assume the network is asynchronous, but message delivery is guaranteed (eventually) if nodes are not partitioned or failed.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. It also necessitates careful design and implementation to ensure correctness and handle various edge cases. Good luck!

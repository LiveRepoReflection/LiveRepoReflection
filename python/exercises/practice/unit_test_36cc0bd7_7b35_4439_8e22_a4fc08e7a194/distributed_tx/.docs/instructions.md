## The Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a simplified banking system. This system involves multiple bank servers (nodes) that hold account balances. A transaction may require transferring funds between accounts residing on *different* bank servers.  To ensure data consistency, your DTC must guarantee ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties across these distributed transactions.

**Simplified System Model:**

*   **Bank Servers:** Each bank server manages a subset of accounts and their balances. Each server has a unique ID.  Assume there are `N` bank servers, numbered from 1 to `N`.
*   **Accounts:** Accounts are identified by unique integer IDs. Each account resides on exactly one bank server.
*   **Transactions:** A transaction involves a series of fund transfers between accounts. Each transfer specifies a source account, a destination account, and an amount. Transactions are identified by a unique transaction ID.
*   **DTC:** Your implementation will act as the DTC. It receives transaction requests, coordinates the transaction across involved bank servers, and ensures atomicity (all transfers succeed, or none do) and consistency (total funds remain the same).

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `coordinate_transaction(transaction_id, transfers, server_mapping, commit_function, rollback_function)` that simulates the DTC's role.

*   `transaction_id` (int): A unique identifier for the transaction.
*   `transfers` (list of tuples): A list representing the fund transfers within the transaction. Each tuple is of the form `(source_account, destination_account, amount)`.
*   `server_mapping` (dict): A dictionary that maps account IDs to the server ID where the account resides. Example: `{123: 1, 456: 2}` indicates account 123 is on server 1 and account 456 is on server 2.
*   `commit_function` (callable): A function that takes a `transaction_id` and a list of `transfers` and simulates committing the transaction on each relevant bank server. It should return True if all servers committed successfully, and False otherwise.
*   `rollback_function` (callable): A function that takes a `transaction_id` and a list of `transfers` and simulates rolling back the transaction on each relevant bank server. This needs to undo all the transfers that were prepared.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Atomicity:** The DTC must guarantee that all transfers within a transaction are either fully applied or fully rolled back. If any server fails to commit, the DTC must initiate a rollback on all participating servers.
2.  **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes must be durable (simulated by the `commit_function` returning True).
3.  **Concurrency (Simplified):** You don't need to handle concurrent transactions directly. Assume transactions arrive serially.
4.  **Error Handling:** Handle potential failures during the commit phase.  Assume that the `commit_function` can return False to simulate a server failure.
5.  **Efficiency:**  Strive for a solution that minimizes the number of calls to `commit_function` and `rollback_function`.
6.  **Idempotency:** The `commit_function` and `rollback_function` may be called multiple times for the same transaction and transfers. Ensure your solution can handle this.
7.  **Real-world Considerations:** While simplified, design your solution with potential scalability in mind. Think about how your approach could be adapted to handle a larger number of servers and transactions.
8.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** Implement a simplified version of the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.
    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):** Simulate sending a "prepare" message to all involved servers (implicitly done by checking which servers are involved in the `transfers`).
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):** Based on the outcome of the prepare phase (simulated by `commit_function` returning True/False), either commit or rollback the transaction on all involved servers.

**Input/Output:**

The function `coordinate_transaction` should return `True` if the transaction was successfully committed, and `False` if it was rolled back.

**Example:**

```python
def coordinate_transaction(transaction_id, transfers, server_mapping, commit_function, rollback_function):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Example Usage (Illustrative - You don't need to make it executable)
transaction_id = 123
transfers = [(1, 2, 100), (3, 4, 50)] # Transfer 100 from account 1 to 2, and 50 from account 3 to 4
server_mapping = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2} # Account 1 & 3 are on server 1, accounts 2 & 4 are on server 2

def mock_commit(transaction_id, transfers):
    # In a real system, this would involve sending commit messages to bank servers.
    # For this example, we just simulate success.
    return True

def mock_rollback(transaction_id, transfers):
    # In a real system, this would involve sending rollback messages to bank servers.
    # For this example, we just simulate success.
    return True

success = coordinate_transaction(transaction_id, transfers, server_mapping, mock_commit, mock_rollback)

if success:
    print("Transaction committed successfully.")
else:
    print("Transaction rolled back.")
```

**Scoring:**

The solution will be evaluated based on correctness (passing all test cases, including edge cases and failure scenarios), efficiency, and adherence to the specified constraints. The more efficiently your code can handle a variety of transaction scenarios, the better the score.

## Project Name

`OptimalResourceAllocation`

## Question Description

A large-scale distributed computing platform manages a vast pool of heterogeneous resources (CPU cores, memory, GPU units, storage). You are tasked with designing an efficient resource allocation system to handle incoming job requests. Each job requires a specific combination and quantity of resources. The platform aims to maximize resource utilization and minimize job completion time, all while adhering to strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Resource Representation:** The platform manages `n` different types of resources. Each resource type `i` has a total quantity `total_i` available.

2.  **Job Representation:** A job `j` is defined by a set of resource requests. Each job `j` requires `request_ij` units of resource type `i`. A job can only start if all its resource requirements are met simultaneously.

3.  **Resource Allocation:**
    *   Jobs can be allocated resources in any order.
    *   A resource can be allocated to multiple jobs concurrently if the total requested amount does not exceed the total available.
    *   Once a job is allocated all its resources, it starts running immediately.

4.  **Job Execution Time:** Each job `j` has an estimated execution time `execution_time_j`.

5.  **QoS Constraint:** A crucial QoS constraint is that the *weighted average completion time* (WACT) of all jobs must be minimized. Each job `j` has a weight `weight_j` representing its priority. The WACT is calculated as:

    ```
    WACT = sum(weight_j * completion_time_j) / sum(weight_j)
    ```

    where `completion_time_j` is the time when job `j` finishes execution.

6.  **Preemption:** To further optimize WACT, the system supports *preemption*. A running job can be paused (preempted), its resources released, and later resumed from the point of interruption. Preemption has a *preemption cost* associated with it. Each time a job is preempted, its `execution_time_j` increases by `preemption_cost_j`. The system can only preempt a limited number of jobs in total, limited by the `max_preemptions` parameter.

7.  **Scalability:** The platform handles a large number of jobs and resource types. The algorithm should be efficient enough to provide near real-time allocation decisions.

**Input:**

*   `resources`: A dictionary where keys are resource names (strings) and values are the total quantity of each resource (integers).  For example: `{"CPU": 100, "Memory": 200, "GPU": 10}`
*   `jobs`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a job. Each job dictionary contains:
    *   `job_id`: A unique identifier for the job (string).
    *   `resource_requests`: A dictionary where keys are resource names (strings) and values are the quantity of each resource required by the job (integers). For example: `{"CPU": 10, "Memory": 20, "GPU": 1}`
    *   `execution_time`: The estimated execution time of the job (integer).
    *   `weight`: The weight/priority of the job (integer).
    *   `preemption_cost`: The preemption cost for the job (integer).
*   `max_preemptions`: The maximum number of preemptions allowed across all jobs (integer).

**Output:**

An optimal schedule that minimizes the WACT, subject to the resource constraints and preemption limit. The schedule should be returned as a list of events, sorted by time. Each event is a dictionary with the following structure:

*   `time`: The time at which the event occurs (integer).
*   `job_id`: The ID of the job involved (string).
*   `event_type`:  One of the following strings: `"allocate"`, `"start"`, `"preempt"`, `"resume"`, `"finish"`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100` (Number of resource types)
*   `1 <= m <= 1000` (Number of jobs)
*   `1 <= total_i <= 1000` (Total quantity of each resource)
*   `1 <= request_ij <= 100` (Resource request size)
*   `1 <= execution_time_j <= 100`
*   `1 <= weight_j <= 100`
*   `0 <= preemption_cost_j <= 10`
*   `0 <= max_preemptions <= 10`
*   All resource quantities, execution times, weights and preemption costs are integers.

**Example:**

```python
resources = {"CPU": 20, "Memory": 40}
jobs = [
    {"job_id": "job1", "resource_requests": {"CPU": 10, "Memory": 20}, "execution_time": 5, "weight": 2, "preemption_cost": 1},
    {"job_id": "job2", "resource_requests": {"CPU": 5, "Memory": 10}, "execution_time": 10, "weight": 1, "preemption_cost": 0},
    {"job_id": "job3", "resource_requests": {"CPU": 5, "Memory": 10}, "execution_time": 8, "weight": 3, "preemption_cost": 2}
]
max_preemptions = 1

# A possible (but not necessarily optimal) output:
[
    {"time": 0, "job_id": "job1", "event_type": "allocate"},
    {"time": 0, "job_id": "job2", "event_type": "allocate"},
    {"time": 0, "job_id": "job1", "event_type": "start"},
    {"time": 0, "job_id": "job2", "event_type": "start"},
    {"time": 5, "job_id": "job1", "event_type": "finish"},
    {"time": 5, "job_id": "job3", "event_type": "allocate"},
    {"time": 5, "job_id": "job3", "event_type": "start"},
    {"time": 13, "job_id": "job3", "event_type": "finish"},
    {"time": 15, "job_id": "job2", "event_type": "finish"}
]
```

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on the correctness of the schedule (meeting resource constraints and preemption limit) and the WACT achieved. Test cases will include scenarios with varying resource availability, job characteristics, and preemption limits.  Solutions that time out will be considered incorrect. Solutions that produce schedules violating the constraints will also be considered incorrect. The solution with minimum WACT will be considered the best.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using dynamic programming or branch and bound techniques to explore the solution space effectively.
*   Think about efficient ways to represent the state of the system (available resources, running jobs, preempted jobs).
*   Explore different job scheduling heuristics like Shortest Job First (SJF) or Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF), and how preemption can be used to improve them.
*   Remember to handle edge cases and optimize for performance.

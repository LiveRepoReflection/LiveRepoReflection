## Question: Optimized Network Routing with Congestion Awareness

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing algorithm for a communication network. The network is represented as a directed graph where nodes are routers and edges are communication links. Each link has a maximum capacity, representing the amount of data it can transmit per unit of time. The network experiences dynamic congestion, meaning the actual available capacity of each link fluctuates over time.

Specifically, you are given the following inputs:

*   **`num_routers`**: An integer representing the number of routers in the network, numbered from 0 to `num_routers - 1`.
*   **`edges`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, capacity)` represents a directed link from router `u` to router `v` with a maximum capacity of `capacity`.
*   **`source`**: An integer representing the source router.
*   **`destination`**: An integer representing the destination router.
*   **`time_windows`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(start_time, end_time)` represents a time window during which you need to find the optimal route.
*   **`congestion_levels`**: A list of lists. Each inner list represents the congestion level of each edge at a specific time. `congestion_levels[t][i]` represents the congestion level of the i-th edge in `edges` at time `t`. Congestion levels range from 0.0 (no congestion) to 1.0 (full congestion).  The length of `congestion_levels` should be equal to the number of unique times in `time_windows`, and it should be ordered by time.
*   **`unique_times`**: A list of unique times at which congestion data is provided. It should be ordered in ascending order.

The goal is to find the route with the maximum *minimum* available capacity across all links in the route for each time window. The available capacity of a link at a given time is calculated as `capacity * (1 - congestion_level)`. In other words, your score for a given route at a given time is the lowest available bandwidth of any link on that path, and you want to maximise this score.

You need to implement a function that takes the above inputs and returns a list of the maximum achievable *minimum* available capacity for each time window. If there is no possible path between the source and destination in a given time window because of link failure (available bandwidth of 0), return -1 for that time window.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `num_routers` <= 100
*   1 <= number of `edges` <= `num_routers * (num_routers - 1)`
*   0 <= `u`, `v` < `num_routers` for each edge `(u, v, capacity)`
*   1 <= `capacity` <= 1000 for each edge
*   0 <= `source`, `destination` < `num_routers`
*   `source` != `destination`
*   1 <= number of `time_windows` <= 100
*   `start_time` < `end_time` for each time window `(start_time, end_time)`
*   All times in `time_windows` and `unique_times` are non-negative integers.
*   The `unique_times` list is sorted and contains all times mentioned in `time_windows`.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Your solution should be efficient enough to handle a large number of routers, edges, and time windows.  Consider the time complexity of your algorithm. Brute-force approaches will likely timeout.  Think about how to efficiently calculate the available capacity and find the optimal route for each time window. Repeatedly calculating the same path is inefficient.

**Real-world Practical Scenario:**

This problem models a real-world scenario of network routing, where the network topology and congestion levels change dynamically. The algorithm needs to adapt to these changes and find the best route to maximize the available bandwidth for critical data transmissions. Congestion could be caused by other traffic, or by a denial of service attack, or by maintenance events.

**Example:**
Consider the edge `(0, 1, 100)`. If, at time 5, `congestion_levels[time_index][edge_index]` is 0.5, where `time_index` corresponds to the index of 5 in `unique_times`, and `edge_index` corresponds to the index of the edge `(0, 1, 100)` in `edges`, then the available bandwidth of that edge at that time is `100 * (1 - 0.5) = 50`.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

Several approaches can be used to solve this problem, including variations of Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, or other graph traversal techniques combined with appropriate data structures for efficient calculation of available capacity and path finding. However, you need to carefully consider the time complexity of your chosen approach and optimize it to meet the efficiency requirements. Dynamic programming might also be applicable with careful state definition. The challenge is to find a solution that is both correct and efficient.

Good luck!

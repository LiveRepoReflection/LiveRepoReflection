## Question: Optimal Traffic Flow Management

**Problem Description:**

The city of Innovatia is experiencing severe traffic congestion. As a brilliant software engineer, you have been tasked to design an optimal traffic flow management system. Innovatia can be represented as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections, and edges represent roads connecting them. Each road has a capacity representing the maximum number of vehicles that can pass through it per unit time.

The city also has a set of designated source intersections (entry points to the city) and destination intersections (exit points from the city). Vehicles enter the city at the source intersections and need to reach the destination intersections.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that determines the maximum number of vehicles that can flow from the source intersections to the destination intersections per unit time, while respecting the capacity constraints of each road. However, the city has some additional constraints and complexities:

1.  **Road Closures:** Due to ongoing construction, a subset of roads might be temporarily closed. Your algorithm must be able to handle these road closures dynamically. You will be given a list of road closures and openings at different time intervals.
2.  **Dynamic Capacities:** The capacity of each road can change over time due to weather conditions, peak hours, etc. You will be given a function that returns the capacity of a road at a given time.
3.  **Emergency Vehicle Routes:** A certain number of emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks) need to travel from specific source intersections to specific destination intersections at a given time. These emergency vehicles must be prioritized, meaning they must be guaranteed to reach their destination, even if it reduces the overall traffic flow. Assume the path of emergency vehicles are pre-determined and fixed.
4.  **Minimizing Travel Time:** While maximizing throughput is crucial, minimizing the *average* travel time of regular vehicles is also important.  The system should strive to balance throughput and travel time. Travel time is defined as the number of road segments traversed.
5.  **Real-time Updates:** The system must be able to efficiently update the traffic flow based on real-time changes in road closures, capacities, and emergency vehicle requests.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph where keys are intersection names (strings), and values are dictionaries representing outgoing edges. Each outgoing edge is represented by the destination intersection (string) as the key, and a function `capacity_function(time)` as the value which takes an integer `time` and returns the road's capacity (integer) at that time.
    * Example: `graph = {"A": {"B": capacity_AB}, "B": {"C": capacity_BC}, "C": {}}`
*   `sources`: A list of source intersection names (strings).
    *   Example: `sources = ["A"]`
*   `destinations`: A list of destination intersection names (strings).
    *   Example: `destinations = ["C"]`
*   `road_closures`: A list of tuples `(start_time, end_time, road_start, road_end)`.  The road from `road_start` to `road_end` is closed during the interval `[start_time, end_time]` (inclusive).
    *   Example: `road_closures = [(10, 20, "A", "B")]` means the road from A to B is closed from time 10 to 20.
*   `emergency_requests`: A list of tuples `(time, source, destination, num_vehicles, path)`.  At `time` (integer), `num_vehicles` (integer) emergency vehicles need to travel from `source` (string) to `destination` (string) along the given `path` (list of strings representing the intersections in order). Assume that the path is valid.
    *   Example: `emergency_requests = [(15, "A", "C", 2, ["A", "B", "C"])]` means at time 15, 2 emergency vehicles need to travel from A to C along the path A->B->C.

*   `time`: An integer representing the current time.

**Output:**

Return a dictionary representing the optimal traffic flow for the given `time`. The keys of the dictionary are tuples `(start_intersection, end_intersection)` representing the roads, and the values are the number of vehicles flowing through that road at that time.
Each road should have an integer flow greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the road's capacity at the given time.
The sum of flow entering an intersection (excluding sources) should equal the sum of flow exiting the intersection (excluding destinations).  The solution should maximize the total flow from sources to destinations while prioritizing emergency vehicles.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 1000 intersections and 5000 roads).
*   The capacity of each road is a non-negative integer.
*   The number of road closures and emergency vehicle requests can be large.
*   The time complexity of your solution should be efficient enough to handle real-time updates.  Aim for something better than recomputing everything from scratch for each time step.
*   You are allowed to preprocess the graph to improve performance.

**Example:**

```python
# Example graph (simplified for brevity)
def capacity_AB(time):
  if time < 5:
    return 10
  else:
    return 5

def capacity_BC(time):
  return 8

graph = {"A": {"B": capacity_AB}, "B": {"C": capacity_BC}, "C": {}}
sources = ["A"]
destinations = ["C"]
road_closures = []
emergency_requests = []
time = 3

# Expected Output (example - actual output depends on your algorithm)
# {("A", "B"): 8, ("B", "C"): 8}

```

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on:

1.  **Correctness:** The traffic flow must be valid, respecting capacity constraints and flow conservation.  Emergency vehicle routes *must* be guaranteed.
2.  **Maximality:** The total flow from sources to destinations should be maximized (after prioritizing emergency vehicles).
3.  **Efficiency:** The solution should be able to handle large graphs and real-time updates within a reasonable time limit.
4.  **Average Travel Time:** Measured via simulation of N regular vehicles and their time to reach destination. Your solution must strike a good balance between throughput and minimizing travel time.

# Traffic Genius

A Python implementation for optimizing traffic flow in a city represented as a directed graph.

## Overview

The `traffic_genius` module provides an algorithm to determine the maximum number of vehicles that can flow from source intersections to destination intersections per unit time, while respecting capacity constraints and handling dynamic conditions like road closures and emergency vehicle priorities.

## Features

- Optimizes traffic flow to maximize throughput
- Handles dynamic road capacities that change over time
- Manages road closures due to construction
- Prioritizes emergency vehicles to guarantee their movement
- Balances between throughput and travel time
- Efficiently updates traffic flow based on real-time changes

## Usage

## Question: Autonomous Infrastructure Allocation

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an autonomous infrastructure allocation system for a large-scale cloud provider. The system needs to efficiently allocate virtual machines (VMs) to incoming user requests, optimizing for both cost and performance.

The cloud provider offers a variety of VM types, each with different CPU, memory, storage, and cost characteristics. User requests specify minimum CPU and memory requirements, as well as a performance score they expect to achieve.

The infrastructure is represented as a large, dynamic graph. Each node in the graph represents a physical machine (PM) with available CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. Edges represent network connections between PMs, with associated latency and bandwidth constraints.

**Input:**

1.  **VM Types:** A list of VM type definitions. Each VM type includes:
    *   `id`: Unique identifier for the VM type.
    *   `cpu`: Number of virtual CPUs.
    *   `memory`: Amount of memory (in GB).
    *   `storage`: Amount of storage (in GB).
    *   `cost_per_hour`: Hourly cost of running the VM.
    *   `performance_score`: Performance score provided by this VM type per unit of work (higher is better).

2.  **Infrastructure Graph:** A description of the infrastructure graph.  Nodes (PMs) have attributes:
    *   `id`: Unique identifier for the PM.
    *   `available_cpu`: Available CPU cores.
    *   `available_memory`: Available memory (in GB).
    *   `available_storage`: Available storage (in GB).
    *   `cost_per_hour`: Hourly cost of keeping the PM powered on (even if unused).
    Edges have attributes:
    *   `source`: Source PM ID.
    *   `destination`: Destination PM ID.
    *   `latency`: Latency between PMs (in milliseconds).
    *   `bandwidth`: Bandwidth between PMs (in Mbps).

3.  **User Request:** A single user request with the following attributes:
    *   `request_id`: Unique identifier for the request.
    *   `required_cpu`: Minimum CPU cores required.
    *   `required_memory`: Minimum memory (in GB) required.
    *   `expected_performance_score`: Minimum performance score required.
    *   `max_latency`: Maximum acceptable latency (in milliseconds) to any other VM fulfilling the same logical function (initially, assume this means latency to all other VMs for simplicity - you can later extend to consider groups of VMs).
    *   `duration`: duration of the request in hours.

**Task:**

Develop an algorithm that efficiently allocates a suitable VM (or set of VMs, for bonus points) to fulfill the user request, satisfying all resource requirements and constraints. Your algorithm should:

1.  **Find Suitable PMs:** Identify PMs in the infrastructure graph that have sufficient available resources (CPU, memory, storage) to host a suitable VM type. Multiple VMs on the same PM is allowed, so long as resources permit.
2.  **Select VM Type:** Choose a VM type that meets the request's CPU, memory, and performance score requirements. The performance score for a request is calculated as the VM type's `performance_score`.
3.  **Latency Constraint:** Ensure that the chosen PM and VM type meet the `max_latency` constraint with respect to all other VMs already allocated *and* any other VMs allocated to fulfill this same request. This means, for each allocated VM, the latency to every *other* allocated VM (for this request and previously) must be no greater than `max_latency`.
4.  **Cost Optimization:** Minimize the total cost of fulfilling the request. This includes the cost of the VM type (VM cost * duration) and the cost of keeping the PM powered on (PM cost * duration). Consider the case where PMs are already powered on. If a PM is turned on because of the request and it's otherwise idle after the request completes, the PM will be turned off.
5.  **Resource Allocation:** Once a suitable PM and VM type are found, allocate the resources on the PM and record the allocation.
6.  **Return Allocation:** Return a data structure representing the successful allocation. This structure should include:
    *   `request_id`: The ID of the fulfilled request.
    *   `vm_id`: The ID of the allocated VM type.
    *   `pm_id`: The ID of the PM where the VM is allocated.
    *   `total_cost`: The total cost of fulfilling the request (VM cost + PM cost).

**Constraints:**

*   The infrastructure graph can be very large (thousands of PMs).
*   The number of VM types can also be significant (hundreds).
*   The algorithm must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   PMs cannot be over-allocated.
*   Latency between PMs is not necessarily symmetric (latency from A to B may not equal latency from B to A).

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   **Fragmentation:** Consider memory fragmentation when allocating VMs to PMs. Implement a strategy to minimize fragmentation.
*   **Multiple VMs per Request:** Allow a single user request to be fulfilled by multiple VMs. This is useful when no single VM type can meet the request's requirements.  Consider how to split the workload and ensure inter-VM communication within the `max_latency` constraint.
*   **Dynamic Re-allocation:** Implement a mechanism for dynamically re-allocating VMs to optimize for changing resource availability or cost.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Consider fault tolerance. If a PM fails, the allocated VMs should be automatically re-allocated to other available PMs.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The algorithm must correctly allocate VMs, satisfying all resource requirements and constraints.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
*   **Cost Optimization:** The algorithm must minimize the total cost of fulfilling the request.
*   **Scalability:** The algorithm must be able to handle large infrastructure graphs and a significant number of VM types.
*   **Code Quality:** The code must be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.

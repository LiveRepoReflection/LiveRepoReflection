## Project Name:

`OptimalPathways`

## Question Description:

Imagine a sprawling city meticulously modeled as a directed weighted graph. Each node represents a crucial intersection, and each edge signifies a one-way street connecting these intersections. The weight of an edge denotes the travel time (in minutes) along that street.

The city is divided into several districts, each with its own unique character and purpose. Some districts are residential, others are commercial, and some are industrial. A crucial aspect is the "risk factor" associated with each district, reflecting safety, congestion, and other potential delays.

You are tasked with designing an optimal route planning system for a delivery company operating within this city. The company needs to deliver packages from a central depot (node 0) to various destination nodes, while considering both travel time and risk exposure.

**Specifically, your system should find the *k* shortest paths (in terms of total travel time) from the depot (node 0) to a given destination node, subject to a maximum allowable risk exposure.**

The risk exposure of a path is calculated as the sum of the risk factors of all districts the path traverses. Each node belongs to exactly one district.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the city (0 to n-1).
*   `m`: The number of one-way streets (edges).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with travel time `w`.
*   `district_assignments`: A list of integers, where `district_assignments[i]` represents the district ID to which node `i` belongs. District IDs are numbered from 0.
*   `risk_factors`: A list of integers, where `risk_factors[i]` represents the risk factor of district `i`.
*   `destination`: The destination node.
*   `k`: The number of shortest paths to find.
*   `max_risk`: The maximum allowable risk exposure for any path.

**Output:**

*   A list of the *k* shortest paths from node 0 to the destination node, sorted in ascending order of total travel time. Each path should be represented as a list of nodes visited in order, including the start and destination nodes.
*   If fewer than *k* paths exist that satisfy the `max_risk` constraint, return all such paths.
*   If no paths exist that satisfy the `max_risk` constraint, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `n` <= 500
*   0 <= `m` <= `n * (n - 1)`
*   0 <= `u`, `v` < `n`
*   1 <= `w` <= 100 (travel time)
*   0 <= `district_assignments[i]` < number of districts
*   1 <= `risk_factors[i]` <= 100
*   0 <= `destination` < `n`
*   1 <= `k` <= 100
*   0 <= `max_risk` <= 100000

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   The graph may not be connected.
*   There may be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.
*   There may be cycles in the graph.
*   The destination node may be unreachable from the depot.
*   The *k* shortest paths may overlap.
*   The optimal path might revisit a node.
*   The depot and destination could be the same node.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient, especially for larger graphs.  A naive approach (e.g., generating all possible paths and then filtering) will likely time out.
*   Consider the trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm with modifications, A\* search, or other pathfinding algorithms).

**System Design Aspects (Implicit):**

*   Think about how this system could be extended to handle real-time traffic updates, road closures, or dynamic risk factor adjustments.  While you don't need to implement these extensions, consider how your design would accommodate them.

This problem requires careful consideration of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques to achieve a solution that is both correct and efficient. It also tests the ability to handle numerous edge cases and understand the practical implications of the problem scenario. Good luck!

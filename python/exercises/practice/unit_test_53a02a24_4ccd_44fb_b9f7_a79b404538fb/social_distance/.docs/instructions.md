## Problem: Decentralized Social Network Analysis

**Description:**

Imagine a decentralized social network built on a blockchain. Each user has a unique identifier (UID), and connections between users are recorded as immutable transactions on the blockchain.  However, due to privacy concerns and the nature of the decentralized system, directly querying the entire blockchain is computationally expensive and reveals potentially sensitive information about the network topology.

Your task is to design and implement a system for efficiently analyzing specific aspects of this social network, given a limited number of allowed queries to the underlying blockchain.

**Specifics:**

You are given the following:

1.  **`get_connections(uid)`:** A function that simulates querying the blockchain. This function takes a user ID (`uid`) as input and returns a *set* of user IDs that are directly connected to the given `uid`. Each call to `get_connections(uid)` counts as **one query**. Due to resource limitations, you are allowed a maximum number of `Q` queries.  `get_connections(uid)` returns an empty set if the UID doesn't exist.

2.  **`start_uid`:** A starting user ID.  This is the user from which you will begin your analysis.

3.  **`target_uids`:** A set of user IDs that are your "targets".

4.  **`Q`:**  The maximum number of queries you are allowed to make to the `get_connections` function.

Your goal is to implement a function, `analyze_network(start_uid, target_uids, Q, get_connections)`, that determines the **minimum distance (number of hops)** from the `start_uid` to *any* of the `target_uids` in the social network.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

*   **Query Limit:** You **must** adhere to the query limit `Q`. Exceeding this limit will result in failure.
*   **Efficiency:** Your solution should aim to minimize the number of queries used.  Solutions that use fewer queries will be preferred.  Consider the trade-offs between breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and other graph traversal algorithms.
*   **Scalability:** While the provided test cases might be small, your solution should be designed with scalability in mind.  Think about how your approach would perform with millions of users.
*   **Optimized Solution:** A naive solution (e.g., querying every user's connections up to `Q` levels) will likely fail due to the query limit. You need to strategically explore the network.
*   **Error Handling:** If none of the `target_uids` are reachable from the `start_uid` within the query limit `Q`, return `-1`.
*   **UIDs are integers:** All UIDs are non-negative integers.
*   **Network is undirected:** If `uid1` is connected to `uid2`, then `uid2` is also connected to `uid1`. However, `get_connections(uid)` only returns the connections for the specified `uid`.

**Example:**

```python
def get_connections(uid):
    # Simulates querying the blockchain (replace with actual blockchain interaction)
    network = {
        1: {2, 3},
        2: {1, 4, 5},
        3: {1, 6},
        4: {2},
        5: {2, 7},
        6: {3},
        7: {5}
    }
    return network.get(uid, set()) # Returns set of connected UIDs or empty set if uid not in network

start_uid = 1
target_uids = {7}
Q = 5

# Expected Output: 2 (1 -> 2 -> 7)
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a queue or stack to manage the exploration of the network.
*   Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant queries.
*   Think about how to prioritize your queries to maximize the chances of finding a target UID quickly.  Is it always best to explore the closest neighbors first?
*   The problem statement implies that any solution that takes more queries than another one will be considered to be worse, even if both solutions return the correct answer.

This problem challenges you to combine graph traversal algorithms with resource optimization techniques in a simulated real-world scenario. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem description for a high-level programming competition, focused on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world application.

## Question: Distributed Transaction Ordering and Commitment

### Question Description

Imagine you are building a distributed database system that supports transactions across multiple nodes (servers). Each node stores a subset of the data.  To ensure data consistency, you need to implement a mechanism for ordering and committing transactions that involve multiple nodes.

A *transaction* consists of a set of *operations*. Each *operation* modifies data stored on a specific node. Before a transaction can be committed, all operations within the transaction must be successfully executed on their respective nodes.

The nodes in the system communicate through a network.  The time it takes for a message to travel between two nodes is not constant and can vary significantly.

**Your task is to design and implement an algorithm to determine an optimal order in which to execute transactions, and a protocol for committing these transactions across all involved nodes, minimizing the overall latency and maximizing throughput.**

**Specifically, you must:**

1.  **Represent Transactions:** Design a data structure to represent transactions. Each transaction should include:
    *   A unique Transaction ID.
    *   A list of operations. Each operation specifies:
        *   The node where the operation needs to be executed.
        *   The type of operation (e.g., read, write).
        *   The data involved in the operation.
    *   A list of dependencies. A transaction `T1` depends on `T2` if `T2` must be committed before `T1` can be executed. These dependencies are derived from data dependencies (e.g., `T1` reads data that `T2` writes).

2.  **Dependency Graph Construction:** Given a set of transactions, construct a dependency graph. Nodes in the graph represent transactions, and directed edges represent dependencies between transactions.

3.  **Transaction Ordering:** Devise an algorithm to determine the order in which transactions should be executed. The algorithm should consider the following factors:
    *   **Dependencies:** Transactions must be executed in an order that respects the dependencies defined in the dependency graph.
    *   **Node Locality:**  Prioritize executing transactions whose operations are concentrated on a smaller number of nodes to reduce inter-node communication.
    *   **Parallelism:**  Identify transactions that can be executed in parallel without violating dependencies.

4.  **Commit Protocol:** Implement a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol (or a similar alternative that you justify) to ensure that transactions are committed atomically across all involved nodes. Your protocol must handle:
    *   **Coordination:**  One node is designated as the coordinator for each transaction.
    *   **Voting:**  Each participating node votes on whether to commit the transaction.
    *   **Commit/Abort:**  The coordinator decides whether to commit or abort the transaction based on the votes.
    *   **Failure Handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle node failures and network partitions during the commit process, guaranteeing that the system either commits the transaction on all participating nodes or aborts it on all participating nodes.

5.  **Optimization:** Optimize your transaction ordering and commit protocol to minimize the overall latency (time taken to commit a transaction) and maximize the throughput (number of transactions committed per unit of time). You should consider techniques such as:
    *   **Batching:** Grouping multiple operations for the same node into a single message.
    *   **Asynchronous Communication:**  Using asynchronous communication to avoid blocking while waiting for responses from other nodes.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:**  Developing strategies to resolve conflicts between transactions accessing the same data.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the distributed system can vary from 10 to 100.
*   The number of transactions can be up to 10,000.
*   The number of operations per transaction can vary from 1 to 10.
*   Network latency between nodes can vary significantly (e.g., from 1ms to 100ms).
*   Node failures can occur at any time.
*   You must handle concurrent transactions.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does your solution correctly commit transactions while maintaining data consistency?
*   **Performance:** How does your solution perform in terms of latency and throughput?
*   **Scalability:** How well does your solution scale as the number of nodes and transactions increases?
*   **Fault Tolerance:** How well does your solution handle node failures and network partitions?
*   **Code Quality:** Is your code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, graph algorithms, and concurrency control.  Successful solutions will need to carefully consider the trade-offs between different design choices and implement efficient and robust algorithms. Good luck!

`RouteOptimization`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient route optimization system for a delivery company operating in a large city. The city is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent delivery locations and edges represent roads connecting these locations. Each road has a specific travel time associated with it. The company needs to deliver packages from a central depot to multiple customer locations within a given time window.

**Input:**

*   **Graph Representation:** A directed graph represented as an adjacency list. Each key in the adjacency list represents a location (node), and the corresponding value is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the destination location (neighbor) and the travel time (integer) to reach that neighbor.
*   **Start Location:** The location of the central depot (string).
*   **Destination Locations:** A list of customer delivery locations (list of strings).
*   **Time Window:** A maximum allowable travel time (integer).
*   **Package Values:** A dictionary where each key is a customer location(string) and each value is the value of the package(integer) to be delivered.

**Constraints:**

1.  **All customer locations must be visited.** There is no partial credit for visiting some but not all locations.
2.  **The route must start at the central depot and end at the central depot.** The delivery vehicle must return to the depot after visiting all customer locations.
3.  **The total travel time (including return to the depot) must not exceed the given time window.**
4.  **The goal is to maximize the total value of packages delivered within the given time window.**

**Output:**

*   A list of locations representing the optimal delivery route, starting and ending at the central depot. If no route exists that satisfies all the constraints, return an empty list.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be computationally efficient. Brute-force approaches that explore all possible permutations will not scale for larger graphs and a significant number of delivery locations.
*   Consider algorithmic techniques like dynamic programming, heuristics, or approximation algorithms to find a near-optimal solution within a reasonable time.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Travel times between locations may not be symmetrical (i.e., the time to travel from A to B may not be the same as the time to travel from B to A).
*   There may be multiple valid routes that satisfy the time window constraint. Choose the route that maximizes the total package value.
*   The graph can be large, with thousands of nodes and edges.
*   The number of customer locations can also be significant (up to 15-20).
*   Some locations might not be reachable from the depot within the time limit.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    'depot': [('A', 10), ('B', 15)],
    'A': [('B', 5), ('C', 20), ('depot', 10)],
    'B': [('C', 10), ('depot', 15)],
    'C': [('depot', 5)]
}

start_location = 'depot'
destination_locations = ['A', 'B', 'C']
time_window = 60
package_values = {'A': 50, 'B': 75, 'C': 25}

# Possible optimal route: ['depot', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'depot']
# Total travel time: 10 + 5 + 10 + 5 = 30
# Total package value: 50 + 75 + 25 = 150
```

## Problem: Decentralized Social Network Analysis

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a system to analyze a decentralized social network. This network is composed of nodes (users) and edges (relationships between users).  Unlike traditional centralized social networks, the data for this network is spread across multiple independent servers (shards).

Each shard holds a subset of the network's user data and their direct connections to other users, potentially residing on different shards. Due to the distributed nature, accessing information about a user or their connections requires querying the appropriate shard.

Your goal is to efficiently compute the *k-hop neighborhood* of a given user in this decentralized network. The *k-hop neighborhood* of a user 'u' is the set of all users reachable from 'u' within 'k' hops (edges).

**Input:**

1.  `user_id`: The ID of the user for whom to compute the k-hop neighborhood (integer).
2.  `k`: The number of hops to consider (integer, 0 <= k <= 10).  Note that a k of 0 should return only the original user.
3.  `shard_locator(user_id)`: A function that takes a `user_id` as input and returns the index of the shard (integer) containing that user's data.  Assume this function has O(1) complexity.
4.  `get_connections(shard_index, user_id)`: A function that takes a `shard_index` and a `user_id` as input and returns a list of `user_id`s representing the direct connections (neighbors) of the given user on that shard.  If the `user_id` is not present in the shard, return an empty list.  The maximum number of connections for any given user is limited to 100.

**Output:**

A set of `user_id`s representing the k-hop neighborhood of the given user. The set should include the original `user_id`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** Minimize the number of calls to `get_connections`.  Each call is expensive due to network latency and shard processing.  Consider that there may be hundreds of shards.
*   **Scale:** The number of users in the network can be very large (millions).  The number of users on a single shard is significant.
*   **Shard Independence:**  Shards are independent and do not share memory or resources directly.  All communication must go through the provided `get_connections` function.
*   **No Centralized Data:** You cannot store the entire network graph in memory.  You must operate within the distributed data constraints.
*   **Avoid Redundant Exploration:** Prevent revisiting users already in the neighborhood at a given hop level to avoid infinite loops and unnecessary calls to `get_connections`.
*   **Error Handling:** `get_connections` could return duplicate `user_id`s, you must handle this and not add duplicates to the set.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The number of total users is capped at the maximum integer value, so you do not need to consider integer overflow issues.

**Example:**

```python
def shard_locator(user_id):
  # Simplified example: sharding based on user_id modulo number of shards
  return user_id % 3  # Assume 3 shards

def get_connections(shard_index, user_id):
  # Simplified example: hardcoded connections for each user and shard
  if shard_index == 0:
    if user_id == 0:
      return [1, 2]
    elif user_id == 1:
      return [0, 3]
    elif user_id == 2:
      return [0, 4]
    else:
      return []
  elif shard_index == 1:
    if user_id == 3:
      return [1, 5]
    elif user_id == 5:
      return [3, 6]
    else:
      return []
  elif shard_index == 2:
    if user_id == 4:
      return [2, 7]
    elif user_id == 6:
      return [5, 8]
    elif user_id == 7:
      return [4]
    elif user_id == 8:
      return [6]
    else:
      return []
  else:
    return []

user_id = 0
k = 2

# Expected output (order may vary): {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# (0, 1 hop: 1, 2, 2 hops: 3, 4)
# (1, 1 hop: 0, 3, 2 hops: 1, 5)
```

**Challenge:**

Implement an efficient algorithm to compute the k-hop neighborhood while adhering to the constraints of the decentralized social network. The solution should minimize the number of calls to `get_connections` to improve performance.

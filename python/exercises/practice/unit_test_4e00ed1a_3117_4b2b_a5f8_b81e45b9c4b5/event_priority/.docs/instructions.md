## Question: Scalable Event Prioritization System

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable event prioritization system for a high-volume event stream. Events arrive continuously, each with a unique identifier, a timestamp, a priority score, and a type. The system must efficiently manage these events, allowing for real-time querying of the highest priority events within specified time windows and across different event types.

**Input:**

The system receives a stream of events. Each event is represented by a tuple: `(event_id, timestamp, priority, event_type)`.

*   `event_id`: A unique string identifier for the event.
*   `timestamp`: A Unix timestamp (integer) representing the time the event occurred.
*   `priority`: A floating-point number representing the event's priority. Higher values indicate higher priority.
*   `event_type`: A string representing the type of event (e.g., "login", "purchase", "error").

**Requirements:**

Implement a system that supports the following operations:

1.  **`add_event(event_id, timestamp, priority, event_type)`:** Adds a new event to the system. If the `event_id` already exists, update its `timestamp`, `priority`, and `event_type`.

2.  **`get_top_k_events(k, start_time, end_time, event_types=None)`:** Retrieves the top `k` events with the highest priority within the specified time window (`start_time` <= `timestamp` <= `end_time`). If `event_types` is provided (a list of strings), only consider events of those types. If `event_types` is `None`, consider all event types. The returned events should be sorted in descending order of priority. In case of ties in priority, return the events with the earliest timestamp first. If less than `k` events satisfy the criteria, return all matching events. The return value should be a list of `event_id` strings.

3.  **`remove_event(event_id)`:** Removes the event with the given `event_id` from the system.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large volume of events (millions of events per second).
*   **Efficiency:**  `add_event` and `remove_event` operations should be optimized for speed. `get_top_k_events` should also be efficient, especially for large time windows.
*   **Memory Usage:**  Minimize memory footprint.
*   **Real-time Querying:** `get_top_k_events` queries should return results within a reasonable time frame (e.g., milliseconds).
*   **Data Consistency:** The system should maintain data consistency even under concurrent operations.
*   **Timestamp Range:** The `timestamp` values will be within a large range (e.g., several years).
*   **Number of Event Types:** The number of distinct `event_type` values can be large (e.g., thousands).
*   `k` in `get_top_k_events` can vary significantly (from 1 to 10000).

**Considerations:**

*   Think about the data structures you will use to store and index the events. How will these data structures scale to handle large datasets?
*   How will you optimize the `get_top_k_events` operation? Consider using appropriate indexing or pre-computation techniques.
*   How will you handle concurrent operations to ensure data consistency? Thread safety is essential.
*   Consider different trade-offs between space and time complexity.

This problem requires you to design a system that balances the need for fast event insertion/removal with the need for efficient querying. The choice of data structures and algorithms will significantly impact the performance and scalability of your solution. Good luck!

## Question: Optimal Path in a Dynamic Risk Network

Imagine a critical infrastructure network represented as a directed graph. Each node represents a facility (e.g., power station, water treatment plant, data center), and each directed edge represents a dependency between facilities (e.g., power supply, data flow).

Each node `i` has an associated *risk level* `r_i(t)` that changes dynamically over time `t`. The risk level is an integer value between 0 and 100, inclusive, and represents the probability of a facility failure or compromise.

Each edge `(i, j)` has a *transfer risk* `tr(i, j, t)` also changing dynamically over time `t`. The transfer risk is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive, and represents the probability that a failure at facility `i` will propagate to facility `j`.

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of facilities in the network. Facilities are numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(i, j)`, representing directed edges from facility `i` to facility `j`.
*   `risk_levels`: A function `risk_levels(t)` that returns a list of N integers representing the risk levels `r_i(t)` for each facility `i` at time `t`.
*   `transfer_risks`: A function `transfer_risks(t)` that returns a dictionary where the keys are tuples `(i, j)` representing edges, and the values are floats representing the transfer risks `tr(i, j, t)` at time `t`.
*   `start`: The starting facility (an integer between 0 and N-1).
*   `end`: The destination facility (an integer between 0 and N-1).
*   `T`: The total time steps to consider. Time starts at `t=0` and goes up to `t=T-1`.
*   `max_path_length`: The maximum length (number of edges) a path can have.

Your objective is to find the path from the `start` facility to the `end` facility that *minimizes the cumulative risk* over the entire time period `T`, subject to the path length constraint.

The cumulative risk of a path `P = [v_0, v_1, ..., v_k]` at time `t` is calculated as follows:

`CumulativeRisk(P, t) = r_{v_0}(t) + tr(v_0, v_1, t) * r_{v_1}(t) + tr(v_0, v_1, t) * tr(v_1, v_2, t) * r_{v_2}(t) + ... + (product of transfer risks along P) * r_{v_k}(t)`

The cumulative risk of a path over the entire time period `T` is the sum of the cumulative risks at each time step:

`TotalCumulativeRisk(P) = sum_{t=0}^{T-1} CumulativeRisk(P, t)`

**Constraints:**

*   The path must start at the `start` facility and end at the `end` facility.
*   The path must not contain cycles.
*   The path length (number of edges) must be less than or equal to `max_path_length`.
*   The graph may not be connected (there may be no path from start to end).
*   The functions `risk_levels(t)` and `transfer_risks(t)` can be computationally expensive to call; minimize calls.
*   Optimize for both correctness and efficiency.  Brute-force approaches are unlikely to solve the problem within a reasonable time limit for larger networks.

**Output:**

Return a list of integers representing the optimal path (sequence of facility indices) from `start` to `end` that minimizes `TotalCumulativeRisk(P)`. If no path exists that satisfies the constraints, return an empty list `[]`.

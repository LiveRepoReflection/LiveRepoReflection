`OptimalRoutePlanner`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal route planning system for a delivery company operating in a large city. The city is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent locations (delivery points, warehouses, etc.) and edges represent roads connecting them. Each road has a travel time associated with it, which can vary depending on traffic conditions.

The delivery company has a fleet of vehicles, each starting from a central depot. Each vehicle needs to visit a specific set of delivery points (a subset of all the nodes in the graph) and return to the depot. The order in which a vehicle visits its assigned delivery points is flexible and needs to be optimized.

**Input:**

*   A directed graph represented as an adjacency list. Each key in the adjacency list is a node ID (integer), and its value is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a neighbor node ID and the travel time (integer) to reach that neighbor.
*   A list of vehicle routes. Each vehicle route is a list of node IDs representing the delivery points that the vehicle must visit, in addition to the starting depot node.
*   A central depot node ID (integer).
*   A traffic prediction function `traffic_prediction(node1, node2, current_time)` which takes two node IDs and a current time (integer, representing seconds since the start of the day) as input and returns the predicted travel time (integer) between those nodes at that specific time. Note that traffic predictions are not perfect and might vary slightly from the actual travel time. Assume that this function is already implemented and you can call it. You need to model the dynamic nature of the graph edges by querying this function repeatedly.

**Output:**

*   A list of optimized routes, one for each vehicle. Each optimized route is a list of node IDs representing the order in which the vehicle should visit its delivery points and return to the depot, along with the estimated time of arrival for each node, starting at time 0 from the depot.

    For example:
    `[[depot_id, 0], [node1_id, arrival_time1], [node2_id, arrival_time2], ..., [depot_id, arrival_time_final]]`

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Minimize total travel time:** The primary goal is to minimize the total travel time for all vehicles to complete their routes.
*   **Dynamic Travel Times:** The travel time between nodes is not constant. It depends on the time of day, as predicted by the `traffic_prediction` function. You should query the `traffic_prediction` function at each step to estimate the travel time between nodes. You must consider the time spent travelling to the next node when predicting the travel time for the subsequent node.
*   **Visit all delivery points:** Each vehicle *must* visit all the delivery points assigned to it.
*   **Return to Depot:** Each vehicle *must* start and end its route at the central depot.
*   **Time Complexity:** The solution should be efficient enough to handle graphs with up to 1000 nodes and 100 vehicles, each with up to 20 delivery points. A naive brute-force approach will not be feasible. Consider that `traffic_prediction` might be a relatively expensive operation.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle disconnected graphs, empty routes, and situations where a vehicle has no delivery points assigned (it should just return to the depot immediately).
*   **Real-World Considerations:** The solution should be robust and consider the dynamic nature of traffic. Simple shortest path algorithms might not be sufficient. Consider using heuristics or approximation algorithms to find a near-optimal solution within the time constraints.
*   **No Vehicle Capacity Restrictions:** Assume that vehicles have unlimited capacity.
*   **Integer Math:** All times are integers representing seconds.

**Example:**

```python
# Example Graph (Adjacency List)
graph = {
    0: [(1, 10), (2, 15)],  # Depot (node 0)
    1: [(3, 12), (0, 10)],
    2: [(3, 8), (0, 15)],
    3: [(0, 20)]
}

# Example Vehicle Routes
vehicle_routes = [
    [1, 2],  # Vehicle 1: Visit nodes 1 and 2
    [3]     # Vehicle 2: Visit node 3
]

depot_id = 0

def traffic_prediction(node1, node2, current_time):
    # Simplified traffic prediction (replace with a more realistic model)
    base_time = graph[node1][0][1] if graph[node1][0][0] == node2 else graph[node1][1][1]
    return base_time + (current_time % 60) // 10  # Add a small time variation based on current time

# Expected Output (Example - actual times will vary):
# [
#  [[0, 0], [1, 10], [2, 22], [0, 37]],  # Vehicle 1: Depot -> 1 -> 2 -> Depot
#  [[0, 0], [3, 20], [0, 40]]   # Vehicle 2: Depot -> 3 -> Depot
# ]
```

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to handle unexpected delays (e.g., road closures) and re-optimize the routes dynamically. This is not required for a correct solution, but it can demonstrate a deeper understanding of the problem.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of real-world constraints. Good luck!

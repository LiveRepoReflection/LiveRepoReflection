## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication in a Distributed System

**Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing inter-service communication in a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` services, uniquely identified by integers from 0 to `N-1`. These services communicate with each other by sending messages. The cost of sending a message between two services is dependent on the network topology, message size, and service load.

The network topology is represented as a weighted, directed graph, where nodes represent services and edges represent communication channels. The weight of an edge `(u, v)` represents the base cost of sending a message directly from service `u` to service `v`. If no direct edge exists between `u` and `v`, communication must occur through intermediary services.

Each service has a processing capacity, represented by an integer.  When a service `u` sends a message of size `s` to service `v`, service `u`'s processing capacity decreases by `s`, and service `v`'s processing capacity also decreases by `s`. A service cannot send or receive messages if its processing capacity falls below zero.

The goal is to design an efficient algorithm to determine the minimum cost of sending a set of `M` messages between specified pairs of services, while respecting the processing capacity constraints of each service.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of services (1 <= `N` <= 100).
*   `capacities`: A list of `N` integers representing the initial processing capacity of each service.
*   `graph`: A list of tuples representing the weighted, directed graph. Each tuple is in the form `(u, v, cost)`, where `u` is the source service, `v` is the destination service, and `cost` is the base cost of sending a message directly from `u` to `v` (0 <= `u`, `v` < `N`, 1 <= `cost` <= 1000). If there is no edge from `u` to `v`, there will be no tuple representing it in the list.
*   `M`: The number of messages to send (1 <= `M` <= 1000).
*   `messages`: A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple is in the form `(source, destination, size)`, representing a message to be sent from service `source` to service `destination` with a size of `size` (0 <= `source`, `destination` < `N`, 1 <= `size` <= 100).

**Output:**

*   The minimum total cost to send all `M` messages, or -1 if it is impossible to send all messages given the capacity constraints.

**Constraints:**

*   The total processing capacity of all services will not exceed 100,000.
*   You must send all messages in the order they are given in the `messages` list.
*   Intermediate services used to relay messages also have their processing capacity reduced. The message size applies to *all* services involved in the message path, including the sender, receiver and any intermediate nodes.
*   You can use Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate shortest paths, but you need to carefully consider how to incorporate capacity constraints into your pathfinding.
*   Optimizing the solution for time complexity is critical. Solutions that exceed a reasonable time limit will be rejected. Consider using dynamic programming techniques or other optimization strategies.
*   If multiple shortest paths exist between two services, the algorithm should prioritize the path with the least number of hops (intermediate services).

This problem requires careful consideration of graph algorithms, resource constraints, and optimization techniques, making it a challenging and sophisticated coding problem. Good luck!

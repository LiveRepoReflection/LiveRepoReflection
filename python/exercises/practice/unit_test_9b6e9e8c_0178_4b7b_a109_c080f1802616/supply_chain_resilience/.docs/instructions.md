Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging Python coding problem. Here's the problem description:

## Problem: Optimizing Supply Chain Resilience

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a resilient supply chain for a critical product. The supply chain consists of a network of nodes (factories, warehouses, distribution centers) and edges (transportation links). Each node has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of product it can process per unit time. Each edge has a bandwidth, representing the maximum amount of product that can be transported between two nodes per unit time, and a failure probability, representing the probability that the link will be unavailable.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that, given the supply chain network, node capacities, edge bandwidths, edge failure probabilities, a source node, a destination node, and a required throughput (the amount of product that needs to reach the destination node per unit time), optimizes the network to minimize the expected cost while ensuring the required throughput is met with a high degree of confidence.

**Specifically, you need to implement a function that:**

1.  **Models the Supply Chain:** Represent the supply chain as a directed graph.  Consider using a library like `networkx` or implementing your own graph data structure.

2.  **Calculates Flow:** Implement a flow algorithm (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp) to determine the maximum possible flow through the network.

3.  **Handles Edge Failures:** Implement a method to simulate edge failures based on their failure probabilities.  This will require a Monte Carlo simulation.

4.  **Estimates Reliability:**  Estimate the probability that the network can achieve the required throughput, given the edge failure probabilities.  This will be calculated from the Monte Carlo simulations.

5.  **Optimizes Cost:**  The optimization function should try to minimize cost while meeting the throughput and reliability requirements. Cost is defined as the sum of the costs to upgrade the capacity of a node.
    *   You are provided with a function `node_upgrade_cost(node, additional_capacity)` that returns the cost of upgrading a node's capacity by `additional_capacity`. You can upgrade any node in the network, but the node capacity must be an integer.
    *   Upgrading bandwidth on edges is not allowed to reduce complexity.

6.  **Constraints and Considerations:**

    *   **Required Throughput:** The solution *must* ensure the required throughput is met with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).
    *   **Node Capacity Limits:** The flow through each node cannot exceed its capacity.
    *   **Edge Bandwidth Limits:** The flow through each edge cannot exceed its bandwidth.
    *   **Non-negativity:** Flow values must be non-negative.
    *   **Integer Flow (Bonus):** Ideally, the algorithm should attempt to find integer flow solutions, as products are often discrete units. Not strictly required, but highly valued.
    *   **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be reasonably efficient, as large supply chain networks can be computationally expensive to analyze.  Consider the time complexity of your chosen algorithms.
    *   **Realism:** The model should be as realistic as possible, considering potential bottlenecks and single points of failure.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the supply chain graph. Keys are node names (strings). Values are dictionaries representing outgoing edges.  Inner dictionaries have the form: `{"destination_node": (bandwidth, failure_probability)}`.
*   `node_capacities`: A dictionary mapping node names (strings) to their initial capacity (integers).
*   `source`: The source node (string).
*   `destination`: The destination node (string).
*   `required_throughput`: The minimum throughput required (integer).
*   `confidence_level`: The desired confidence level (float between 0 and 1).
*   `node_upgrade_cost`: A function that takes a node name (string) and an additional capacity (integer) as input and returns the cost of the upgrade (integer).

**Output:**

*   A dictionary mapping node names (strings) to the *additional* capacity required to meet the throughput and reliability requirements.  A value of 0 indicates no capacity upgrade is needed for that node. Return an empty dictionary if no solution is possible.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    "A": {"B": (10, 0.1), "C": (5, 0.2)},
    "B": {"D": (7, 0.05)},
    "C": {"D": (8, 0.15)},
    "D": {}
}
node_capacities = {"A": 15, "B": 8, "C": 10, "D": 20}
source = "A"
destination = "D"
required_throughput = 12
confidence_level = 0.95

def node_upgrade_cost(node, additional_capacity):
    return additional_capacity * 10  # Example cost function

result = optimize_supply_chain(graph, node_capacities, source, destination, required_throughput, confidence_level, node_upgrade_cost)
print(result)
# Expected Output (example, may vary based on algorithm): {'A': 5, 'C': 2}
```

This output indicates that to meet the required throughput with 95% confidence, node A needs an additional capacity of 5, and node C needs an additional capacity of 2.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must produce the correct additional node capacities to meet the throughput and reliability requirements.
*   Efficiency: The solution should be reasonably efficient. Solutions that take an excessively long time to run (e.g., brute-force approaches) will be penalized.
*   Readability and Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   Robustness: The solution should handle various edge cases and network configurations gracefully.
*   Optimization: The solution should minimize the total upgrade cost.
*   Use of appropriate data structures and algorithms.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, probability theory, simulation, and optimization. It is designed to be challenging and requires a sophisticated understanding of these concepts. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem, designed to be concise, complex, and similar to LeetCode Hard in difficulty.

### Project Name

```
OptimalOrderPlacement
```

### Question Description

A large e-commerce company uses a distributed system to manage its inventory and order placements. The inventory is spread across multiple warehouses, and each warehouse has a limited capacity for each product. The company wants to optimize its order placement strategy to minimize shipping costs while ensuring that all orders are fulfilled.

You are given the following information:

*   `warehouses`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a warehouse. Each warehouse has the following keys:
    *   `id`: A unique identifier for the warehouse (integer).
    *   `capacity`: A dictionary representing the warehouse's capacity for each product. The keys are product IDs (strings), and the values are the maximum quantity of that product the warehouse can store (integers).
    *   `shipping_cost`: A dictionary representing the cost of shipping one unit of each product from this warehouse. The keys are product IDs (strings), and the values are the cost (floats).

*   `orders`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an order. Each order has the following keys:
    *   `id`: A unique identifier for the order (integer).
    *   `products`: A dictionary representing the products and quantities requested in the order. The keys are product IDs (strings), and the values are the quantity required (integers).

Your task is to write a function `optimize_order_placement(warehouses, orders)` that returns a dictionary representing the optimal order placement strategy. The dictionary should have the following structure:

*   Keys: Order IDs (integers).
*   Values: A dictionary representing how each product in the order should be fulfilled from different warehouses.
    *   Keys: Product IDs (strings).
    *   Values: A dictionary representing the quantity of the product to be sourced from each warehouse.
        *   Keys: Warehouse IDs (integers).
        *   Values: Quantity of the product to be sourced from the warehouse (integers).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the total shipping cost across all orders.
2.  **Fulfillment Guarantee:** All orders must be completely fulfilled.
3.  **Capacity Constraints:** The quantity of each product sourced from a warehouse cannot exceed its capacity.
4.  **Non-negativity:** The quantity of each product sourced from a warehouse must be non-negative.
5.  **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient, especially for a large number of warehouses and orders (consider time complexity).
6.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   A product is not available in any warehouse.
    *   A warehouse has no capacity for a particular product.
    *   An order requests a product that does not exist in any warehouse.
    *   Multiple optimal solutions exist. Your solution can return any one of them.
7.  **Real-world Considerations:**  Think about how this problem could be scaled in a real-world system. Although you don't need to implement the scaling aspects, consider the data structures and algorithms used, and how they would perform with significantly larger datasets. Could you parallelize parts of the computation? How would you handle updates to inventory in real time?

**Example:**

```python
warehouses = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "capacity": {"A": 5, "B": 10},
        "shipping_cost": {"A": 1.0, "B": 2.0},
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "capacity": {"A": 10, "C": 5},
        "shipping_cost": {"A": 1.5, "C": 2.5},
    },
]

orders = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "products": {"A": 7, "B": 3},
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "products": {"A": 2, "C": 4},
    },
]

# Expected Output (one possible optimal solution):
# {
#     1: {
#         "A": {1: 5, 2: 2},
#         "B": {1: 3},
#     },
#     2: {
#         "A": {2: 2},
#         "C": {2: 4},
#     },
# }
```

This problem combines elements of optimization, constraint satisfaction, and efficient algorithm design, making it a challenging task suitable for a high-level programming competition. Good luck!

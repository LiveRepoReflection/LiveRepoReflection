## Problem: Scalable Distributed Graph Processing

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed system for processing a massive graph. The graph represents a social network, where nodes represent users and edges represent friendships. The graph is far too large to fit into the memory of a single machine. Your system must be able to perform graph traversals and computations efficiently, even with billions of nodes and edges.

Specifically, you need to implement a function that computes the *k-hop neighborhood* of a given user (node) in the graph. The *k-hop neighborhood* of a user `u` is the set of all users that can be reached from `u` within `k` hops (traversals along edges).

**Input:**

*   A starting user ID `start_user_id` (integer).
*   The hop distance `k` (integer, `1 <= k <= 10`).
*   A function/interface `get_neighbors(user_id)` that, given a user ID, returns a list of its direct neighbors (i.e., users connected by an edge). **This function is the only way to access the graph data.** Assume that calling `get_neighbors` is a potentially expensive operation (simulating network latency and distributed data access). The returned list of neighbor IDs may not be sorted.
*   A maximum number of `get_neighbors` calls, `MAX_API_CALLS` (integer, `100 <= MAX_API_CALLS <= 1000`). Exceeding this limit will result in failure.

**Output:**

*   A sorted list of unique user IDs representing the *k-hop neighborhood* of `start_user_id`, excluding `start_user_id` itself.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** The solution must be designed to handle graphs with billions of nodes and edges. Although you will be testing against a smaller graph, consider how your solution would scale in a real-world distributed environment. Think about data partitioning, load balancing, and minimizing data transfer.
2.  **Efficiency:** The primary constraint is the number of calls to the `get_neighbors` function (`MAX_API_CALLS`). Your solution will be judged based on its ability to minimize these calls. Each call is expensive, representing inter-machine communication in a distributed system. Avoid redundant calls.
3.  **No Graph Materialization:** You cannot load the entire graph into memory. You must rely on the `get_neighbors` function to access the graph data on demand. This simulates a distributed data store.
4.  **Correctness:** The output list must contain all users within `k` hops and no users beyond `k` hops. Duplicates and the `start_user_id` must be excluded. The output list must be sorted in ascending order.
5.  **Memory Usage:** While there isn't a strict memory limit, avoid using excessive memory. Aim for a solution that has a memory footprint that scales reasonably with the size of the `k-hop neighborhood`.
6.  **Fault Tolerance (Conceptual):** While you don't need to implement actual fault tolerance, consider how your solution could be made resilient to failures in a distributed environment. For example, could you restart a failed worker process and continue the computation?

**Example:**

Let's say we have the following graph (represented implicitly through `get_neighbors`):

*   `get_neighbors(1)` returns `[2, 3]`
*   `get_neighbors(2)` returns `[1, 4, 5]`
*   `get_neighbors(3)` returns `[1, 6]`
*   `get_neighbors(4)` returns `[2]`
*   `get_neighbors(5)` returns `[2]`
*   `get_neighbors(6)` returns `[3]`

If `start_user_id = 1` and `k = 2`, the 2-hop neighborhood of user 1 is `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.  The output should be `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does it produce the correct *k-hop neighborhood*?
*   **API Call Count:** How many times does it call the `get_neighbors` function? Lower is better. Solutions exceeding `MAX_API_CALLS` will fail.
*   **Efficiency:** How quickly does it complete for larger graphs? (Measured indirectly through API call count and code complexity)
*   **Code Clarity:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires you to think about graph algorithms, distributed systems concepts, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

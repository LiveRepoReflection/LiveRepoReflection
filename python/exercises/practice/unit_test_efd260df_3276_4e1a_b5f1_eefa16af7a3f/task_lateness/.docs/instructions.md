Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Python coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines**

**Problem Description:**

You are given a set of `N` tasks, each with the following attributes:

*   `id`: A unique integer identifier for the task (1 to N).
*   `duration`: The amount of time (in arbitrary units) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline`: The time (in arbitrary units) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies`: A list of task IDs that must be completed before this task can start.

Your goal is to determine the optimal schedule for completing these tasks such that the total *lateness* is minimized.  The lateness of a task is defined as max(0, completion\_time - deadline), where completion\_time is when the task is finished. The total lateness is the sum of the lateness of all tasks.

If a task cannot be completed before its deadline due to dependencies or time constraints, its lateness is still calculated as described above.

**Constraints:**

1.  `1 <= N <= 1000`
2.  `1 <= duration <= 100` for each task
3.  `1 <= deadline <= 10000` for each task
4.  Dependencies must be acyclic (no circular dependencies).
5.  If a task has multiple dependencies, all of them must be completed before the task can start.
6.  You can only work on one task at a time.
7.  You can assume that all task IDs in dependencies are valid (between 1 and N).

**Input:**

A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a task. For example:

```python
tasks = [
    {"id": 1, "duration": 5, "deadline": 10, "dependencies": []},
    {"id": 2, "duration": 3, "deadline": 15, "dependencies": [1]},
    {"id": 3, "duration": 7, "deadline": 20, "dependencies": [1, 2]},
    {"id": 4, "duration": 2, "deadline": 12, "dependencies": []}
]
```

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum total lateness achievable by scheduling the tasks optimally.

**Example:**

For the input above, one possible optimal schedule is:

1.  Task 1 (duration 5, deadline 10) - Completes at time 5, lateness 0.
2.  Task 4 (duration 2, deadline 12) - Completes at time 7, lateness 0.
3.  Task 2 (duration 3, deadline 15) - Completes at time 10, lateness 0.
4.  Task 3 (duration 7, deadline 20) - Completes at time 17, lateness 0.

Total lateness: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

**Challenge:**

The challenge lies in finding the optimal task execution order, considering dependencies and deadlines, to minimize the total lateness.  A brute-force approach (trying all possible permutations) won't work due to the constraint on `N`.  Efficient algorithms and careful optimization techniques will be required to solve this problem within reasonable time limits. The efficiency and correctness of your algorithm will be heavily scrutinized.

Good luck!

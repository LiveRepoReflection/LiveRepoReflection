## Problem: Decentralized Collaborative Document Editing with Conflict Resolution

### Description

You are tasked with designing a system for decentralized collaborative document editing. Multiple users can simultaneously edit the same document, and the system needs to handle conflicting edits gracefully, ensuring eventual consistency.

Imagine a distributed network where each user has a local copy of a document. When a user edits their local copy, they propagate the changes to other users in the network. Due to network latency and independent editing, conflicts can arise when two users make changes to the same part of the document. Your goal is to implement a conflict resolution mechanism that merges these conflicting edits into a coherent final document.

**Document Representation:** The document is represented as a sequence of paragraphs. Each paragraph is a string. The document is thus a list of strings.

**Operations:** Users can perform the following operations on the document:

1.  **Insert Paragraph:** Insert a new paragraph at a specific index.
2.  **Delete Paragraph:** Delete a paragraph at a specific index.
3.  **Edit Paragraph:** Modify the content of an existing paragraph at a specific index. The edit is represented as a string containing the full new content for the paragraph.

**Conflict Resolution:** When conflicting operations are detected, the system should attempt to merge them intelligently. Implement a conflict resolution strategy that prioritizes non-destructive operations (edits) over destructive ones (deletes). If there are conflicting insertions, resolve based on user ID (lower ID wins).

**Constraints:**

*   **Decentralized:** The conflict resolution logic must be able to run on each user's local machine without requiring a central server.
*   **Eventual Consistency:** All users' documents should eventually converge to the same state after all operations are applied and conflicts are resolved.
*   **Operation Ordering:** Operations may arrive in any order. Your system must handle out-of-order operations correctly.
*   **User ID:** Each operation is associated with a user ID (integer).
*   **Timestamp:** Each operation is associated with a timestamp (integer, representing milliseconds since the epoch).  Timestamps can be used for tie-breaking in certain conflict resolution scenarios (e.g., conflicting inserts from the same user). If timestamps are identical, user ID should be used.
*   **Real-time aspects:** While not strictly real-time, the system should aim for low latency in applying operations and resolving conflicts.  Avoid extremely inefficient algorithms.
*   **Space constraints:** While not extremely important, avoid blowing up memory usage.

**Input:** A list of operations. Each operation is a dictionary with the following keys:

*   `user_id`: An integer representing the user who performed the operation.
*   `timestamp`: An integer representing the timestamp of the operation.
*   `type`: A string representing the type of operation ("insert", "delete", "edit").
*   `index`: An integer representing the index of the paragraph to be modified.
*   `content`: A string representing the content to be inserted, deleted, or used as the new content for an edit.

**Output:** The final document (a list of strings representing the paragraphs) after applying all operations and resolving conflicts.

**Example:**

```python
operations = [
    {"user_id": 1, "timestamp": 1678886400000, "type": "insert", "index": 0, "content": "Paragraph 1"},
    {"user_id": 2, "timestamp": 1678886400001, "type": "insert", "index": 0, "content": "Paragraph 2"},
    {"user_id": 1, "timestamp": 1678886400002, "type": "edit", "index": 0, "content": "Edited Paragraph 1"},
    {"user_id": 3, "timestamp": 1678886400003, "type": "delete", "index": 0, "content": None},
]

# Expected Output (one possible outcome after conflict resolution):
# ["Paragraph 2"]
```

**Scoring:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must correctly apply operations and resolve conflicts to produce a consistent final document.
*   **Conflict Resolution Strategy:** The conflict resolution strategy should be reasonable and prioritize non-destructive operations.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems concepts. It also challenges the ability to design a robust and efficient solution that can handle a variety of edge cases and constraints. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging, incorporating a number of the requested elements:

**Problem Title:** Optimal Train Network Routing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing system for a high-speed train network connecting a set of cities. The train network is represented as a weighted, undirected graph where:

*   Nodes represent cities, each with a unique ID (integer).
*   Edges represent direct train lines between cities, with weights representing travel time (in minutes).

Each train has a **capacity**, representing the maximum number of passengers it can carry. Passengers want to travel between various pairs of cities. You are given a list of passenger requests. Each request specifies a source city, a destination city, and the number of passengers who want to travel from the source to the destination.

Your goal is to determine the **minimum number of train trips** required to fulfill all passenger requests, considering train capacities and travel times. You can assume that trains instantly appear at the source city when needed and instantly disappear upon reaching the destination city. Trains can only travel on existing edges in the graph, and passengers on a single request must travel together on the same train.

**Input:**

1.  `num_cities`: An integer representing the number of cities in the network (numbered 0 to `num_cities - 1`).
2.  `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(city1, city2, travel_time)` represents a direct train line between `city1` and `city2` with the given `travel_time`.
3.  `train_capacity`: An integer representing the maximum number of passengers a train can carry.
4.  `passenger_requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(source_city, destination_city, num_passengers)` represents a passenger request to transport `num_passengers` people from `source_city` to `destination_city`.

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum number of train trips required to fulfill all passenger requests. If it is impossible to fulfill all requests, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_cities <= 1000`
*   `0 <= city1, city2 < num_cities`
*   `1 <= travel_time <= 100`
*   `1 <= train_capacity <= 100`
*   `1 <= len(passenger_requests) <= 1000`
*   `1 <= num_passengers <= 100`

**Efficiency Requirements:**

The solution should be optimized for efficiency. A naive solution might time out for larger inputs. Consider using efficient algorithms and data structures. Aim for a time complexity better than O(N^3) where N is the number of cities.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   The graph might not be fully connected.
*   There might be multiple shortest paths between two cities. You are free to choose any shortest path.
*   If a passenger request requires more than one train trip (due to exceeding train capacity), the number of trips should be minimized.
*   If no path exists between a source and destination for a passenger request, it's impossible to fulfill the request.

**Example:**

```python
num_cities = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 15), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 12), (2, 4, 20), (3, 4, 8)]
train_capacity = 15
passenger_requests = [(0, 4, 10), (1, 4, 20), (0, 3, 5)]

# Expected Output: 4
# Explanation:
# - (0, 4, 10): Path 0->2->4.  Needs 1 train.
# - (1, 4, 20): Path 1->3->4.  Needs 2 trains (20/15 = 1.33, ceil to 2)
# - (0, 3, 5): Path 0->1->3. Needs 1 train.
# Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 trains
```

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path), basic arithmetic, and careful handling of edge cases and constraints. The efficiency requirement will force candidates to think about optimization strategies. Good luck!

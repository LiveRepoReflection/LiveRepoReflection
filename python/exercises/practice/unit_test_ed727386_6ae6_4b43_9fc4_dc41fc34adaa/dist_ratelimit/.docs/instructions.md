## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter. This rate limiter should be able to handle a very high volume of requests across multiple servers, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage of a resource.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Functionality:** The rate limiter should allow a client (identified by a unique key, such as an IP address or user ID) to make a certain number of requests within a given time window. If the client exceeds the limit, subsequent requests should be rejected or delayed (your choice, but be consistent and document it).

2.  **Distribution:** The rate limiter must be distributed across multiple servers (imagine hundreds or thousands). This means that the rate limiting logic and data storage cannot reside on a single machine.

3.  **Consistency:** The rate limiting should be as consistent as possible across the distributed system. A client should not be able to bypass the rate limit by sending requests to different servers.  While perfect consistency is often impractical, strive for strong eventual consistency.  Explain the consistency model your design offers.

4.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter should be efficient and have low latency. It should not significantly impact the performance of the underlying resource being protected. Strive for O(1) complexity for rate limiting checks where possible or explain any deviations.

5.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing request volumes. Adding more servers should increase the capacity of the rate limiter.

6.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be resilient to failures. If one or more servers fail, the rate limiting should continue to function correctly, albeit possibly with reduced capacity or consistency.

7.  **Configuration:** The rate limiter should be configurable, allowing administrators to adjust the rate limits for different clients or resources.  Consider a hierarchical configuration system to allow for global, group, and individual overrides.

8.  **Concurrency:** The system should handle concurrent requests efficiently and correctly.

9. **Real-time Metrics:** The rate limiter should expose real-time metrics (e.g., requests per second, rejected requests, average latency) for monitoring and analysis.

**Constraints:**

*   You can use any suitable data storage technology for storing rate limiting data (e.g., Redis, Memcached, Cassandra, a custom database). Justify your choice.
*   Assume you have access to a reliable message queue for inter-server communication (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
*   Assume that server clocks are reasonably synchronized (e.g., using NTP). Clock skew should be handled gracefully, if possible.
*   You must design a solution that's practical and can be implemented efficiently. Do not propose solutions that are theoretically perfect but impossible to implement in a real-world scenario.
*   Consider edge cases like server restarts, network partitions, and data corruption.

**Deliverables:**

*   A clear and concise architectural diagram of your proposed system.
*   A detailed description of the algorithms and data structures used for rate limiting.
*   A discussion of the trade-offs made in your design (e.g., consistency vs. performance, storage cost vs. accuracy).
*   A rough estimate of the resources required to handle a specific request volume (e.g., number of servers, memory usage, network bandwidth).
*   A description of how you would monitor and maintain the rate limiter in a production environment.
*   A brief outline of how you would test your implementation, focusing on the distributed aspects.
*   A detailed discussion of the chosen data storage and message queue technologies and why they're suitable.
*   Python code snippets demonstrating core rate limiting logic (e.g., incrementing counters, checking limits). A fully working implementation is not required, but the snippets should be clear and well-commented. Focus on showcasing the distributed aspects.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement adaptive rate limiting, where the rate limits are automatically adjusted based on the observed traffic patterns and server load.
*   Implement a tiered rate limiting system, where clients are assigned to different tiers with different rate limits.
*   Implement burst handling, allowing clients to exceed the rate limit for a short period of time.
*   Graceful degradation: When a server fails, the rate limiter should continue to function, possibly with reduced accuracy or capacity, rather than failing completely. Explain how this is achieved.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. Solutions will be evaluated based on correctness, efficiency, scalability, fault tolerance, and clarity of presentation. Good luck!

## Problem: Decentralized Ride-Sharing Optimization

**Description:**

Imagine a decentralized ride-sharing network operating in a city. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, there's no central server dictating matches. Instead, riders and drivers broadcast their requests/availability and rely on a peer-to-peer matching system. Your task is to simulate and optimize this matching process within certain constraints.

The city is represented as a weighted graph, where nodes are locations and edges represent roads with associated travel times (weights). Riders post ride requests specifying a start and end location. Drivers broadcast their current location and availability.

Due to network limitations and privacy concerns, riders and drivers can only communicate directly if they are within a certain "communication radius" (measured in travel time) of each other on the graph.

Given a set of ride requests and driver availabilities at a specific time, your goal is to maximize the number of fulfilled ride requests (one driver fulfilling one request).  A ride is considered "fulfilled" if:

1.  A driver and rider are within the communication radius of each other.
2.  A driver can reach the rider's start location, pick up the rider, and then reach the rider's destination within a maximum allowable ride time.  The driver does not need to return to the original location.

**Input:**

*   `city_graph`: A weighted graph represented as an adjacency list (dictionary). Keys are node IDs (integers), and values are lists of tuples: `[(neighbor_node_id, travel_time), ...]`.
*   `ride_requests`: A list of tuples: `[(rider_id, start_location, end_location), ...]`.
*   `driver_availabilities`: A list of tuples: `[(driver_id, current_location), ...]`.
*   `communication_radius`: An integer representing the maximum travel time for direct communication.
*   `max_ride_time`: An integer representing the maximum allowable travel time for a fulfilled ride (driver to start + start to end).

**Output:**

*   A list of tuples representing the matched rides: `[(driver_id, rider_id), ...]`. The output should represent the *maximum* possible number of fulfilled rides.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Graph Size:** The city graph can be large (thousands of nodes).  Consider efficient graph traversal algorithms.
*   **Optimization:** Finding the absolute optimal matching might be computationally expensive.  Focus on finding a *good* matching within a reasonable time.
*   **Communication Radius:**  Efficiently determine which drivers and riders are within the communication radius.
*   **Multiple Valid Solutions:**  There might be multiple possible matchings that maximize the number of fulfilled rides.  Any such matching is acceptable.
*   **Real-world Factors:** Consider the problem's grounding in real-world scenarios when designing your solution.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Solutions should be efficient with regard to time complexity. Solutions with excessive complexity can exceed time limits.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider cases with no riders, no drivers, disconnected graphs, riders and drivers at the same location, and extreme values for communication radius and max ride time.
*   **Scalability:** While the immediate test cases might be small, consider how your solution would scale to a city with tens of thousands of riders and drivers.
*   **Greedy vs. Global:** Explore the trade-offs between greedy algorithms (faster but potentially suboptimal) and more global optimization techniques (slower but potentially better). Can you find a hybrid approach?

**Example:**

```python
city_graph = {
    1: [(2, 5), (3, 10)],
    2: [(1, 5), (4, 7)],
    3: [(1, 10), (5, 3)],
    4: [(2, 7), (6, 2)],
    5: [(3, 3), (6, 8)],
    6: [(4, 2), (5, 8)]
}
ride_requests = [(101, 1, 6), (102, 2, 5)]
driver_availabilities = [(201, 3), (202, 4)]
communication_radius = 8
max_ride_time = 20

# Possible valid output: [(201, 101)]
# Driver 201 at location 3 is within communication radius of Rider 101 at location 1 (travel time 10 > 8, so it is outside of communication range).
# Driver 201 at location 3 is within communication radius of Rider 102 at location 2 (travel time 10 + 5 > 8, so it is outside of communication range).

# Driver 202 at location 4 is within communication radius of Rider 101 at location 1 (travel time 7 + 5 = 12 > 8, so it is outside of communication range).
# Driver 202 at location 4 is within communication radius of Rider 102 at location 2 (travel time 7 < 8, so it is inside of communication range).
# Ride time for Driver 202 to pick up Rider 102 and go to the destination = 7 (4 to 2) + distance(2, 5) = 7 + 5 + 3 = 15 < max_ride_time

# Another Possible valid output: []
```

**Good luck!** This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints.

## Problem: Optimal Task Assignment with Dependencies

**Description:**

You are managing a large-scale project comprised of `N` tasks. Each task `i` (where `0 <= i < N`) has a cost `C[i]` associated with it and a set of dependencies, represented as a list of prerequisite tasks that must be completed before task `i` can begin.  These dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

You have `K` available workers. Each worker can work on **at most one task at a time**.  You can assign multiple workers to different tasks simultaneously, as long as the dependencies are respected.

The goal is to determine the **minimum total cost** of the tasks that MUST be completed to satisfy a critical requirement. This requirement is represented by a set of `M` target tasks. Completing these target tasks guarantees the successful completion of the project. However, completing a target task also requires completing all of its prerequisite tasks (and their prerequisites, and so on).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100000` (Number of tasks)
*   `1 <= K <= 100` (Number of workers)
*   `1 <= M <= N` (Number of target tasks)
*   `0 <= C[i] <= 100000` (Cost of each task)
*   The dependencies form a DAG (no cycles).
*   Task IDs are integers from `0` to `N-1`.
*   You can assume that the input graph is well-formed (no self-loops, no duplicate edges).
*   The set of target tasks is a subset of all tasks.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks.
*   `K`: The number of workers.
*   `C`: A list of `N` integers representing the cost of each task.
*   `dependencies`: A list of lists, where `dependencies[i]` is a list of tasks that are prerequisites for task `i`.
*   `target_tasks`: A list of `M` integers representing the target tasks that must be completed.

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum total cost of completing all tasks required to satisfy the target tasks' dependencies.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large datasets within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Consider the algorithmic complexity of your approach. Inefficient solutions will likely time out. Aim for an algorithm with a time complexity of at least O(N+E), where E is the number of edges in the dependency graph.

**Example:**

```
N = 6
K = 2
C = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
dependencies = [[], [0], [0], [1, 2], [3], [4]]
target_tasks = [5]
```

In this example, to complete task 5, we must complete task 4. To complete task 4, we must complete task 3. To complete task 3, we must complete tasks 1 and 2. To complete tasks 1 and 2, we must complete task 0. Thus, we need to complete tasks [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The total cost is 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 = 210.

**Another Example:**

```
N = 5
K = 3
C = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dependencies = [[], [0], [0], [1,2], []]
target_tasks = [3,4]
```

To complete task 3 we must complete 1 and 2 which also require 0. To complete task 4 we require nothing.  Thus we need to complete tasks [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The total cost is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

**Hints:**

*   Think about how to represent the dependency graph.
*   Consider using topological sorting to determine the order in which tasks can be completed.
*   You'll need to efficiently determine the set of all tasks required to complete the target tasks.
*   The number of workers `K` does not directly influence the *cost* calculation, only potentially the *time* to complete the tasks which is irrelevant in this problem.

Good luck!

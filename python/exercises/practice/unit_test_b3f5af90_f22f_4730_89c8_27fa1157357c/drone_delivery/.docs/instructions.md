`AutonomousDeliveryNetwork`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a core component of an autonomous delivery network for a large metropolitan area. The network consists of delivery drones that transport packages between designated hubs. The objective is to create a system that efficiently determines the optimal routes for drones, considering various constraints and dynamic conditions.

**System Overview:**

The delivery network is represented as a directed graph where:

*   Nodes: Represent delivery hubs. Each hub has a unique ID (integer), geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude), and a maximum capacity (number of drones that can be stationed or visit simultaneously).
*   Edges: Represent possible flight paths between hubs. Each path has a distance (floating-point number) and a dynamic congestion factor (floating-point number, updated periodically) that affects the drone's travel time.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Drone Capacity:** Each drone has a limited battery capacity. A drone cannot traverse a path if the energy required (proportional to distance and congestion factor) exceeds its remaining battery.

2.  **Hub Capacity:** A hub cannot accommodate more drones than its maximum capacity at any given time. Drones arriving at a full hub must wait in a holding pattern (modeled as increased travel time).

3.  **Dynamic Congestion:** The congestion factor for each path changes dynamically based on real-time traffic and weather conditions. The system must be able to adapt to these changes.

4.  **Real-time Route Calculation:** Given a source hub, a destination hub, and a drone's initial battery level, the system must compute the optimal route (shortest travel time) in a timely manner.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should gracefully handle situations where a direct path between two hubs does not exist, or when no feasible route can be found within the drone's battery capacity.

6.  **Optimization:** The route calculation algorithm should be optimized for performance, as it will be invoked frequently with varying network conditions. Consider the trade-offs between computation time and route optimality.

7.  **Scalability:** Your solution should be designed to handle a large number of hubs and paths efficiently.

8.  **Energy Consumption Model:** Assume that the energy consumption for traversing a path is calculated as follows: `energy_consumed = distance * congestion_factor`.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `find_optimal_route(graph, source_hub_id, destination_hub_id, drone_battery_capacity, current_hub_occupancy)` that takes the following inputs:

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the delivery network. The keys are hub IDs (integers), and the values are dictionaries containing hub information:
    *   `'coordinates'`: A tuple of (latitude, longitude).
    *   `'capacity'`: An integer representing the hub's maximum capacity.
    *   `'edges'`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a directed edge to another hub: `(destination_hub_id, distance, congestion_factor)`.

*   `source_hub_id`: An integer representing the ID of the starting hub.

*   `destination_hub_id`: An integer representing the ID of the destination hub.

*   `drone_battery_capacity`: A floating-point number representing the drone's initial battery capacity.

*   `current_hub_occupancy`: A dictionary where keys are hub IDs and values are the number of drones currently at that hub. This value should be considered when calculating travel time.

The function should return a list of hub IDs representing the optimal route from the source to the destination, or `None` if no feasible route exists. The route should minimize the total travel time, considering distance, congestion, hub occupancy, and battery capacity. Return an empty list if the source and destination hub are the same.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   You can use any appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve this problem. Consider algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, A\* search, or other pathfinding algorithms.
*   Pay attention to edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid hub IDs, disconnected graph, etc.).
*   Implement necessary helper functions to support your solution.
*   The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
*   Assume that all input values are valid.
*   The location can be used to calculate distance, but is not required for the solution.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of real-world constraints. A well-designed solution will be both efficient and robust.

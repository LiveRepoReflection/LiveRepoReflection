Okay, here's a challenging problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focusing on efficiency, data structures, and real-world application:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Validator

**Problem Description:**

You are building a distributed system that handles financial transactions. Due to the distributed nature of the system, transactions are processed by multiple independent nodes. Each node maintains a partial view of the overall transaction state. To ensure data consistency and prevent double-spending, you need a robust transaction validator.

Each transaction consists of a unique transaction ID (a UUID string), a set of input accounts (account IDs that are debited), and a set of output accounts (account IDs that are credited). Each account ID is also a UUID string.

Your task is to implement a transaction validator that can efficiently determine if a batch of transactions is valid.  A batch of transactions is considered valid if and only if **all** of the following conditions hold true:

1.  **No Double-Spending:** No single input account is used as input in more than one transaction within the batch.

2.  **Sufficient Funds (Simulated):** Assume each account starts with an "initial balance" of 0. For each transaction, the sum of the input accounts' balances (after deducting previous transactions in the batch) must be non-negative.

3.  **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Consistency:** The transactions within the batch must form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based on account dependencies.  A dependency exists when one transaction uses an output account from another transaction as an input account. Specifically, represent each transaction as a node in the graph. There is a directed edge from transaction A to transaction B if transaction B uses an output account from transaction A as one of its input accounts. If the resulting graph contains cycles, the batch of transactions is invalid.

**Input:**

A list of transactions. Each transaction is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

*   `transaction_id` (string): A unique UUID identifying the transaction.
*   `inputs` (list of strings): A list of UUID strings representing the input account IDs.
*   `outputs` (list of strings): A list of UUID strings representing the output account IDs.

**Output:**

Return `True` if the batch of transactions is valid; otherwise, return `False`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scale:** The number of transactions in a batch can be very large (up to 10<sup>5</sup>). The number of accounts can also be large.
*   **Efficiency:** Your solution must be highly efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Aim for a solution that avoids unnecessary iterations and redundant computations.
*   **UUIDs:**  Assume that all account IDs and transaction IDs are valid UUID strings.
*   **Memory:** Be mindful of memory usage. Avoid creating unnecessary copies of large data structures.
*   **Zero Sum:** The sum of the credits and debits in each individual transaction does not need to be verified. Only account balance constraints need to be checked.

**Example:**

```python
transactions = [
    {
        "transaction_id": "a",
        "inputs": ["account1"],
        "outputs": ["account2"]
    },
    {
        "transaction_id": "b",
        "inputs": ["account2"],
        "outputs": ["account3"]
    },
    {
        "transaction_id": "c",
        "inputs": ["account4"],
        "outputs": ["account1"]
    }
]

# This batch should be valid
```

```python
transactions = [
    {
        "transaction_id": "a",
        "inputs": ["account1"],
        "outputs": ["account2"]
    },
    {
        "transaction_id": "b",
        "inputs": ["account2"],
        "outputs": ["account3"]
    },
    {
        "transaction_id": "c",
        "inputs": ["account3"],
        "outputs": ["account2"]
    }
]

# This batch contains a cycle a->b->c->b and should be invalid
```

**Bonus Challenges (No impact on core correctness, but enhance solution elegance):**

*   Implement the solution using multiple threads or processes to improve performance.
*   Design the solution to handle streaming transactions (i.e., transactions arrive sequentially, and the validator needs to maintain a consistent state).
This problem requires a combination of data structure knowledge (sets, dictionaries, graphs), algorithmic thinking (cycle detection, topological sorting), and optimization skills to handle large datasets efficiently. Good luck!

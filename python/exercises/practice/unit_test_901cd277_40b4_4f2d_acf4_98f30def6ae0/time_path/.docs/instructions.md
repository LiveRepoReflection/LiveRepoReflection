## Problem: Optimal Multi-Source Shortest Paths with Time-Dependent Edge Costs

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient route planning system for a logistics company operating in a dynamic urban environment. The city is represented as a weighted directed graph, where nodes represent locations and edges represent roads connecting them. Each road has a traversal time that varies depending on the time of day due to traffic conditions.

Given:

*   `n`: The number of locations (nodes) in the city, numbered from 0 to n-1.
*   `m`: The number of roads (directed edges).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, cost_profile)`, where `u` and `v` are the source and destination node indices respectively, and `cost_profile` is a list representing the time-dependent traversal cost. `cost_profile` contains 24 integer values representing the traversal time of the road for each hour of the day (0-23). For example, `cost_profile[0]` is the cost of traversing the road if you enter it at hour 0, `cost_profile[1]` is the cost if you enter at hour 1, and so on.
*   `sources`: A list of starting locations (node indices).
*   `destination`: The target location (node index).
*   `start_time`: The hour of the day (0-23) when the journey begins.

Your Goal:

Find the minimum time required to travel from *any* of the source locations to the destination location, starting at the given `start_time`. Your solution should efficiently handle the time-dependent edge costs and potentially large graph sizes.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `n` <= 10^5 (Number of locations)
*   1 <= `m` <= 3 * 10^5 (Number of roads)
*   0 <= `u`, `v` < `n` (Valid node indices)
*   1 <= `cost_profile[i]` <= 100 (Traversal time for each hour)
*   1 <= `len(sources)` <= `n` (Number of source locations)
*   0 <= `start_time` <= 23 (Valid start time)
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   There is no guarantee of a path between sources and the destination. If no path exists, return -1.
*   The solution must be optimized for both time and memory efficiency. A naive implementation might lead to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) errors.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
m = 6
edges = [
    (0, 1, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]),
    (0, 2, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1]),
    (1, 3, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1, 2]),
    (2, 3, [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1, 2, 3]),
    (3, 4, [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1, 2, 3, 4]),
    (4, 0, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
]
sources = [0, 1]
destination = 4
start_time = 8

```

**Expected Output:**

The minimum time to reach location 4 from either location 0 or 1, starting at hour 8. You need to compute this time based on the provided time-dependent edge costs.
```
20
```
**Hint:** Consider adapting Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path algorithm to handle the time-dependent edge costs. You'll need to carefully manage the time of day at each step of the algorithm. Think about how to efficiently represent the graph and the cost profiles. Also, consider the multi-source aspect.

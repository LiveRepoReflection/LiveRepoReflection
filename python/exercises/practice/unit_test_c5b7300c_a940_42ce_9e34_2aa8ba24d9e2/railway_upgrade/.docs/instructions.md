**Optimal Railway Network Upgrade**

## Question Description

The Ministry of Transportation is planning a major upgrade to the national railway network. The goal is to minimize the maximum delay experienced by any passenger due to the upgrade work. The railway network consists of cities and railway tracks connecting them. Each track has a length and a list of scheduled trains with their departure times.

During the upgrade, a section of a railway track can be closed for maintenance. While a section is closed, trains cannot travel on it, and passengers must find alternative routes.

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of cities, numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `tracks`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(city1, city2, length, trains)` represents a railway track between `city1` and `city2` with a certain `length`. `trains` is a list of departure times (integers representing minutes from the start of the day). The track is bi-directional.
*   `upgrade_schedule`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(city1, city2, start_time, end_time)` represents a scheduled closure of the track between `city1` and `city2` (and `city2` and `city1`) from `start_time` to `end_time` (inclusive). These times are in minutes from the start of the day.
*   `passenger_trips`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(departure_city, arrival_city, desired_departure_time)` represents a passenger's trip. The passenger wants to travel from `departure_city` to `arrival_city`, departing as close as possible to `desired_departure_time`.

Your task is to determine the minimum possible maximum delay experienced by any passenger across all passenger trips, given the upgrade schedule. The delay is the difference between the actual arrival time and the earliest possible arrival time without any track closures.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100` (Number of cities)
*   `1 <= len(tracks) <= N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   `1 <= length <= 100` (Length of each railway track)
*   `1 <= len(trains) <= 24 * 60 / 30` (Maximum of one train every 30 minutes). Trains can depart at any minute of the day.
*   `0 <= city1, city2 < N`
*   `0 <= start_time < end_time <= 24 * 60 - 1` (Time in minutes from the start of the day)
*   `1 <= len(upgrade_schedule) <= 100`
*   `1 <= len(passenger_trips) <= 100`
*   `0 <= desired_departure_time <= 24 * 60 - 1`

**Optimization Requirements:**

Your solution must be efficient. A naive approach of calculating delays for all passengers for every possible track closure will likely time out. Consider using optimized graph algorithms and efficient data structures. You should consider cases where no path exists between the departure and arrival cities, in which case the delay is infinite. Minimize the maximum delay across all passengers.

**Edge Cases:**

*   There might be multiple tracks between two cities with potentially different trains.
*   A passenger might not be able to reach their destination due to track closures.
*   A track might be closed for the entire duration of a passenger's potential travel time.
*   There might be no trains scheduled at the desired departure time. The passenger must wait for the next available train.
*   The graph representing the railway network might be disconnected.

**Clarifications:**

*   Assume train travel is instantaneous once a train departs. The travel time is incorporated into the departure time of the next train.
*   If a passenger arrives at a city before the next train departs, they must wait for the train.
*   You can change trains at any city.
*   You need to find the *minimum* of the *maximum* delay across all passengers.

Good luck!

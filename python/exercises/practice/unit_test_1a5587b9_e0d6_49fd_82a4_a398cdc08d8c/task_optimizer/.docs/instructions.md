## Question: Optimal Task Assignment with Complex Dependencies

**Problem Description:**

You are managing a large-scale project consisting of `N` tasks. Each task `i` has a cost `C[i]` associated with its execution.  You have `M` available workers, each with different skillsets.  Assigning a worker to a task doesn't directly influence the cost.

However, the tasks have complex interdependencies. Some tasks can only be started *after* others have been completed. These dependencies are represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent tasks and edges represent dependencies. An edge from task `A` to task `B` indicates that task `A` must be completed before task `B` can start.

Furthermore, to optimize the project, you have a limited number of "collaboration opportunities".  Each collaboration opportunity allows you to *remove* a single dependency edge between two tasks.  You are allowed to remove at most `K` dependency edges. Removing an edge means task B no longer needs task A to be completed before it.

Your goal is to find the minimum total cost to execute *all* `N` tasks, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Dependency Constraint:**  All tasks must be executed in an order that respects the remaining dependencies after you have removed up to `K` edges.  If task `A` depends on task `B`, then task `B` must be completed before task `A` can be started.
2.  **Total Cost:** The total cost is the sum of the individual costs of all tasks executed.
3.  **Optimal Edge Removal:** You must strategically choose which dependency edges to remove to minimize the total project completion time.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks (1 <= N <= 200)
*   `M`: The number of workers (1 <= M <= 100)
*   `C`: A list of integers representing the cost of each task. `C[i]` is the cost of task `i` (1 <= C[i] <= 10^6).
*   `Dependencies`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(A, B)` represents a dependency: task `A` depends on task `B`.  (0 <= A, B < N).
*   `K`: The maximum number of dependency edges you can remove (0 <= K <= N*(N-1)/2).

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum total cost to execute all tasks, respecting the dependencies after optimally removing at most `K` edges. If it is impossible to complete all tasks due to circular dependencies (even after removing K edges), return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   The input graph is guaranteed to be acyclic initially.
*   You must execute *all* tasks.  Partial task completion is not allowed.
*   The number of dependencies can be large.
*   The graph can be dense.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient to pass all test cases.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.  Consider memoization, dynamic programming, or other optimization techniques.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
M = 10
C = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Dependencies = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]  // 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
K = 1

Possible Solution:

Remove the edge (1, 2).  The dependencies become (0, 1), (2, 3).
Possible task order: 2, 0, 1, 3.

Minimum total cost: 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100
```

```
N = 3
M = 10
C = [10, 20, 30]
Dependencies = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]
K = 1

Output: -1 (as it is not possible to complete the tasks due to circular dependencies even if one dependency is removed)
```

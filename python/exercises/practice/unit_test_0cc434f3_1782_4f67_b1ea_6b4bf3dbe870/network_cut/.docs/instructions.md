Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging coding problem. Here's the question:

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkPartitioning`

**Question Description:**

You are given a representation of a network infrastructure. The network consists of `n` nodes and `m` bidirectional connections (edges) between them. Each node represents a server, and each connection represents a communication link.

The network is represented as follows:

*   Nodes are labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
*   Connections are given as a list of tuples `edges`, where each tuple `(u, v, cost)` represents a connection between node `u` and node `v` with an associated `cost`. The cost represents the operational overhead of maintaining that link.

Due to budget constraints, you need to partition the network into `k` disconnected subnetworks. To achieve this, you must remove some of the existing connections.

Your task is to find the *minimum total cost* of connections that need to be removed to partition the network into exactly `k` disconnected subnetworks.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
*   `0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2` (Number of edges)
*   `1 <= k <= n` (Number of disconnected subnetworks)
*   `0 <= u, v < n` (Valid node indices)
*   `0 <= cost <= 10^6` (Cost of removing a connection)
*   The graph is guaranteed to be initially connected.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

The solution should be efficient enough to handle large networks within a reasonable time limit (e.g., under 10 seconds). Aim for a solution with a time complexity of O(E log V) or better, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   What if `k = 1`? (No connections need to be removed.)
*   What if `k = n`? (All connections need to be removed.)
*   Disconnected nodes in the initial graph.
*   Duplicate edges in the input (handle appropriately).
*   Cycles in the graph.
*   Negative cycle in the graph.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Think about efficient algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees or similar concepts.
*   Can you leverage dynamic programming techniques?
*   Consider using appropriate data structures to optimize performance.

**Real-world Analogy:**

Imagine a company with a large server infrastructure. They want to split the infrastructure into separate departments for security or organizational reasons. Each connection between servers has a cost associated with severing it. The goal is to split the servers into the desired number of departments while minimizing the disruption (cost) of severing those connections.

**System Design Hints (Though not strictly required):**

*   Think about how this problem could be adapted to a distributed system.
*   Consider how you would handle a very large graph that doesn't fit into memory.

Good luck!

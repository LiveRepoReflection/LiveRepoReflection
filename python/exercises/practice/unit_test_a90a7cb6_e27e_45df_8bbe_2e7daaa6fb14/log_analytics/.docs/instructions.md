## Question: Distributed Log Aggregation and Analysis

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for aggregating and analyzing logs generated by a distributed system. This system consists of numerous microservices running on different machines. Each microservice generates log entries containing timestamps, service identifiers, log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR), and message payloads.

Your system needs to efficiently collect, store, and analyze these logs to identify potential issues, performance bottlenecks, and security threats. Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **Log Aggregation:** Design a mechanism to collect log entries from all microservices in real-time. Consider the network bandwidth and potential message loss during transmission. Design your solution with consideration for the scalability of the microservices.

2.  **Log Storage:** Choose a suitable data structure or data store to store the aggregated logs, capable of handling high write throughput and supporting efficient querying. The solution should support the ability to search by timestamp, service identifier, and log level.

3.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** Implement an algorithm to detect anomalies in the log data in real-time. Define "anomaly" clearly, but it should include things like sudden spikes in error logs, unusual patterns of activity from specific services, or unexpected sequences of events.

4.  **Querying and Analysis:** Provide an interface to query the logs and perform analysis. The interface should allow users to specify time ranges, service identifiers, log levels, and keywords to search for. The system should be able to efficiently return the matching log entries. Support the ability to return the N most frequent messages per microservice.

5.  **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:** The system should be scalable to handle a large number of microservices and a high volume of log data. It should also be fault-tolerant to ensure that log data is not lost in case of failures.

**Constraints:**

*   The system must handle a continuous stream of log data in real-time.
*   The system must be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing load.
*   The system must be fault-tolerant and ensure data is not lost in case of failures.
*   Query performance must be optimized for large datasets.
*   Memory usage should be reasonable. Avoid loading the entire dataset into memory.
*   Consider network bandwidth and latency during log aggregation.
*   The anomaly detection algorithm must have a low false positive rate while still being able to detect real anomalies.
*   The number of total microservices can be up to 10,000.

**Input:**

Simulate a stream of log entries. Each log entry should be a dictionary or JSON-like object containing:

*   `timestamp`: A Unix timestamp (integer).
*   `service_id`: A string representing the identifier of the microservice.
*   `log_level`: A string representing the log level (e.g., "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR").
*   `message`: A string containing the log message.

**Output:**

*   A system that can continuously aggregate and store log data.
*   An anomaly detection system that identifies and reports anomalies in real-time.
*   A query interface that allows users to search for log entries based on various criteria.
*   An interface that returns the N most frequent messages per microservice.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a visualization component to display the aggregated log data and anomalies.
*   Integrate with a monitoring system to trigger alerts based on detected anomalies.
*   Implement rate limiting to prevent overload of the system.

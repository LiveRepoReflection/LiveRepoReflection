## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a system to optimally allocate multiple types of resources to a set of competing tasks in a distributed environment. The goal is to maximize overall system throughput while adhering to strict resource constraints and minimizing communication overhead.

**System Overview:**

Imagine a cluster of *N* worker nodes. Each worker node possesses limited quantities of *M* different resource types (e.g., CPU cores, GPU memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O).  There's a central scheduler responsible for assigning tasks to these worker nodes.

A stream of tasks arrives at the scheduler. Each task *T<sub>i</sub>* requires a specific amount of each of the *M* resource types to execute. A task can only be assigned to a single worker node. Once assigned, a task consumes the allocated resources on that node until it completes.  Assume task execution times are known in advance.

**Optimization Goal:**

Your objective is to design an algorithm for the central scheduler that maximizes the *total number of completed tasks* within a given time window *W*.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Resource Constraints:** The total resource requirements of all tasks assigned to a worker node at any given time cannot exceed the node's capacity for any of the *M* resource types.  Assume resource usage is continuous (e.g., a task uses its allocated CPU cores throughout its execution).

2.  **Task Dependencies:** Tasks may have dependencies. A task *T<sub>j</sub>* may depend on the output of task *T<sub>i</sub>*.  A task cannot start execution until all its dependencies have been completed.  Dependencies are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

3.  **Communication Overhead:**  Transferring data between worker nodes is expensive. The scheduler should aim to assign dependent tasks to the same worker node whenever possible to minimize inter-node communication.  Assume a communication cost *C* is incurred for each unit of data transferred between different worker nodes. This cost should be factored into the optimization.

4.  **Dynamic Task Arrivals:** Tasks arrive over time. The scheduler must make allocation decisions in a timely manner as new tasks become available. It is not feasible to re-optimize the entire schedule every time a new task arrives.

5.  **Preemption is NOT allowed:** Once a task is assigned to a worker node and starts executing, it cannot be moved (preempted) to another node.

6.  **Heterogeneous Worker Nodes:** Worker nodes may have different capacities for each resource type.

7.  **Time Window:** You are given a fixed time window *W* within which to maximize completed tasks.

**Input Format:**

Your algorithm will receive the following inputs:

*   *N*: The number of worker nodes (integer).
*   *M*: The number of resource types (integer).
*   *W*: The time window (integer).
*   `node_capacities`: A 2D array of size *N* x *M*, where `node_capacities[i][j]` represents the capacity of worker node *i* for resource type *j*.
*   `task_definitions`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a task and contains the following information:
    *   `arrival_time`: The time at which the task arrives at the scheduler (integer).
    *   `resource_requirements`: An array of size *M*, where `resource_requirements[j]` represents the amount of resource type *j* required by the task.
    *   `execution_time`: The time it takes for the task to complete (integer).
    *   `dependencies`: A list of task IDs (integers) that this task depends on.
    *   `output_data_size`: The size of the data this task produces, which might need to be transferred to dependent tasks (integer).
*   *C*: The communication cost per unit of data transferred between worker nodes (float).

**Output Format:**

Your algorithm should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a task assignment and contains the following information:

*   `task_id`: The ID of the task (integer).  IDs are implicit based on the order they appear in `task_definitions` (starting from 0).
*   `worker_node_id`: The ID of the worker node to which the task is assigned (integer).
*   `start_time`: The time at which the task starts executing on the worker node (integer).

**Example:**

(This is a simplified example.  Real-world inputs will be much larger and more complex.)

```
N = 2  # 2 worker nodes
M = 2  # 2 resource types (CPU, Memory)
W = 10 # Time window of 10 units

node_capacities = [
    [4, 8],  # Node 0: 4 CPU, 8 Memory
    [2, 4]   # Node 1: 2 CPU, 4 Memory
]

task_definitions = [
    (0, [1, 2], 3, [], 10),        # Task 0: Arrives at 0, requires 1 CPU, 2 Memory, executes for 3, no dependencies, 10 units of output data
    (1, [2, 1], 2, [0], 5),        # Task 1: Arrives at 1, requires 2 CPU, 1 Memory, executes for 2, depends on Task 0, 5 units of output data
    (2, [1, 1], 4, [], 0)         # Task 2: Arrives at 2, requires 1 CPU, 1 Memory, executes for 4, no dependencies, 0 units of output data
]

C = 0.1  # Communication cost of 0.1 per unit of data

# Possible Output:

[
    (0, 0, 0),  # Task 0 assigned to Node 0, starts at time 0
    (1, 0, 3),  # Task 1 assigned to Node 0, starts at time 3 (after Task 0 completes)
    (2, 1, 2)   # Task 2 assigned to Node 1, starts at time 2
]
```

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Number of Completed Tasks:** The primary metric is the total number of tasks that complete execution within the time window *W*.
2.  **Correctness:** Your solution must respect resource constraints and task dependencies.
3.  **Efficiency:** Your algorithm should be reasonably efficient, capable of handling a large number of tasks and worker nodes within a reasonable time.  Consider the time complexity of your solution.
4.  **Communication Cost:** Solutions with lower communication costs will be favored, all other things being equal.
5.  **Scalability:** How well does your algorithm perform as the number of tasks, worker nodes, and resource types increases?

**Hints:**

*   This problem is NP-hard, so finding the absolute optimal solution is likely infeasible for large inputs. Focus on developing a good heuristic algorithm.
*   Consider using a priority queue to manage task scheduling.
*   Think about how to balance resource utilization across worker nodes while minimizing communication.
*   Explore different task scheduling strategies, such as earliest deadline first, longest processing time first, or a custom heuristic.
*   Dynamic programming or greedy approaches might be useful.
*   You may need to consider the trade-off between the complexity of your algorithm and the quality of the solution.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures to efficiently manage task dependencies and resource availability.

This problem requires a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

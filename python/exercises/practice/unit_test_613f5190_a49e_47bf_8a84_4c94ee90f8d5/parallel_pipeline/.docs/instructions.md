## Question: Parallel Data Processing with Dependency Resolution

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a parallel data processing pipeline for a large dataset. The dataset consists of a collection of data objects, each identified by a unique ID (an integer). Each data object requires certain processing steps to be performed on it. The processing steps are represented as functions.

Crucially, some processing steps have dependencies. A processing step *A* may depend on the output of processing step *B*. This means that step *A* cannot be executed until step *B* has completed for the same data object.

Your goal is to design and implement a system that can process these data objects in parallel, while respecting the dependencies between processing steps. You need to maximize throughput and minimize overall processing time.

**Input:**

1.  `data_objects`: A list of integers representing the IDs of the data objects to be processed.
2.  `processing_steps`: A dictionary where keys are processing step names (strings) and values are functions. Each function takes a data object ID (integer) as input and returns a result (can be any data type).  Assume processing step functions are independent, i.e., don't share state.
3.  `dependencies`: A dictionary where keys are processing step names (strings) and values are lists of processing step names (strings) that the key depends on.  An empty list indicates no dependencies.

**Output:**

A dictionary where keys are data object IDs (integers) and values are dictionaries. The inner dictionaries map processing step names (strings) to their corresponding results for that data object.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Parallelism:** The system must process data objects and processing steps in parallel to improve performance.  Leverage multi-threading or multi-processing in Python.
2.  **Dependency Resolution:** The system must correctly handle dependencies between processing steps. A step cannot be executed until all its dependencies have been satisfied for the current data object.
3.  **Error Handling:** If any processing step raises an exception, the exception should be caught and logged. The system should continue processing other data objects and processing steps. The output dictionary should still contain results for successful processing steps and data objects. Consider adding a special "error" key in the inner dictionary to indicate a processing step failure, containing the exception message.
4.  **Scalability:** The solution should be designed to handle a large number of data objects and processing steps.
5.  **Efficiency:** Minimize memory usage and CPU consumption. Avoid redundant computations.
6.  **Determinism (where possible):** While parallel processing introduces inherent non-determinism, the results for each data object and processing step should be consistent across multiple runs, given the same input.
7.  **Deadlock Prevention:** Ensure the dependency resolution mechanism does not lead to deadlocks.
8.  **Circular Dependencies:** The input will *not* contain circular dependencies.  You do not need to explicitly check for this.
9.  **Input Size:** The number of data objects can be up to 10,000. The number of processing steps can be up to 100.

**Example:**

```python
data_objects = [1, 2, 3]

def step_a(data_id):
  return data_id * 2

def step_b(data_id):
  return data_id + 1

def step_c(data_id):
  return data_id ** 2

processing_steps = {
  "A": step_a,
  "B": step_b,
  "C": step_c
}

dependencies = {
  "A": [],
  "B": ["A"],
  "C": ["A", "B"]
}

# Expected Output (order may vary due to parallelism):
# {
#   1: {"A": 2, "B": 3, "C": 9},
#   2: {"A": 4, "B": 5, "C": 25},
#   3: {"A": 6, "B": 7, "C": 49}
# }
```

## Quantum Key Distribution Network Optimization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and optimizing a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) network for secure communication across a geographically distributed system. The network consists of several quantum nodes interconnected by quantum channels. Each quantum node can perform key generation and relaying. Due to the limitations of quantum technology, quantum channels have significant loss rates (photon loss) that degrade the quality of the distributed keys. Furthermore, quantum key distribution is costly.

The network is represented as a weighted graph where nodes represent quantum nodes and edges represent quantum channels. The weight of each edge represents the photon loss rate (as a probability between 0 and 1) for that channel. A higher weight indicates a higher loss rate and thus a less reliable channel.

You are given a set of communication requests. Each request specifies a source node, a destination node, and the required key size (in bits) for secure communication between those nodes.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that efficiently determines the optimal path (sequence of nodes and channels) for each communication request and calculates the total cost of key distribution across the entire network. The cost is measured in total key size required to distribute all requests.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Path Selection:** For each communication request, you must find a path from the source node to the destination node that minimizes the *cumulative loss rate*. The cumulative loss rate of a path is the product of the loss rates of all channels along that path.  Note that minimizing cumulative loss rate means maximizing the probability of successful key exchange.
2.  **Key Amplification:**  Due to channel losses, the key rate (bits per second) is reduced with each hop. You can assume that the initial key rate generated at each node is 1 bit/second.  The key rate is reduced by the loss rate of each channel.  Thus, the key rate after traversing a channel with loss rate *l* is multiplied by (1-*l*). The resulting key rate is the *effective key rate* for that channel.
3.  **Minimum Effective Key Rate:** The effective key rate along any path must be greater than or equal to a minimum threshold, `min_key_rate`. This constraint ensures the security and practicality of key distribution. If no path with an effective key rate above this threshold exists, the request *cannot* be satisfied.
4.  **Key Consumption:** To establish a secure connection, the total amount of key material consumed along a path must be sufficient to satisfy the request size. The total amount of consumed key is the product of the effective key rate and the distribution time.
5.  **Time Constraint:** You must minimize the total time required to satisfy all communication requests, assuming key amplification at each hop takes negligible time compared to transmission time.

6. **Key Relaying:** A key can be relayed by an intermediate node, but key relaying reduces the key rate. Assume a fixed amplification factor `amp_factor` (between 0 and 1) which is multiplied with the key rate after each relaying.

7.  **Network Capacity:**  Each node has a limited key generation rate `node_capacity` (bits/second). The sum of key generation rate required by all requests that go through a node cannot exceed the node's capacity.

**Input:**

*   `network`: A dictionary representing the network graph. Keys are node IDs (integers), and values are dictionaries of neighboring nodes and their corresponding channel loss rates. For example: `{0: {1: 0.1, 2: 0.2}, 1: {0: 0.1, 3: 0.3}, 2: {0: 0.2}, 3: {1: 0.3}}`
*   `requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a communication request: `(source_node, destination_node, key_size)`. For example: `[(0, 3, 1024), (1, 2, 2048)]`.
*   `min_key_rate`: The minimum acceptable effective key rate (float between 0 and 1).
*   `node_capacity`: The key generation rate for each node (integer). Assume all nodes have the same capacity.
* `amp_factor`: The amplification factor (float between 0 and 1).

**Output:**

*   If all requests can be satisfied within the constraints, return a tuple: `(total_time, path_assignments)`. `total_time` is the total time (in seconds) required to distribute keys for all requests. `path_assignments` is a dictionary where keys are request indices (0-based) and values are the corresponding optimal paths (list of node IDs).
*   If any request cannot be satisfied due to path unavailability (loss rate too high) or network capacity constraints, return `None`.

**Example:**

```python
network = {
    0: {1: 0.1, 2: 0.2},
    1: {0: 0.1, 3: 0.3},
    2: {0: 0.2, 3: 0.4},
    3: {1: 0.3, 2: 0.4}
}
requests = [(0, 3, 1024), (1, 2, 2048)]
min_key_rate = 0.1
node_capacity = 1000
amp_factor = 0.9

# Expected Output (example):
# (15764.705882352942, {0: [0, 1, 3], 1: [1, 3, 2]}) # Time = 1024/(1*0.9*0.7*0.9)+2048/(1*0.7*0.6*0.9)
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution produce the correct output for all valid inputs?
*   Efficiency: Is the solution efficient in terms of time and memory usage, especially for large networks and numerous requests?
*   Optimality: Does the solution find the *optimal* path in terms of minimizing the cumulative loss rate and time to satisfy requests, while respecting all constraints?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path with constraints), optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases and constraints to arrive at an efficient and correct solution. Good luck!

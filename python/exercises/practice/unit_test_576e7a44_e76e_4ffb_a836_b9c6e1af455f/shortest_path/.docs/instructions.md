## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a highly efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path between multiple source nodes and multiple destination nodes in a weighted, directed graph. The graph represents a complex network, such as a city's transportation system or a large-scale data center network.

**Specifics:**

*   **Graph Representation:** The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each node maps to a list of its neighbors. Each edge has a weight (a positive integer) associated with it, representing the cost of traversing that edge.
*   **Multiple Sources and Destinations:** You are given a list of source nodes and a list of destination nodes. Your algorithm must find the shortest path from *any* of the source nodes to *any* of the destination nodes.
*   **Dynamic Graph Updates:** The graph is not static. At certain intervals, edge weights can be updated. Your solution must be able to efficiently incorporate these updates without recomputing the entire shortest path from scratch every time. Edge updates are provided as a list of (start_node, end_node, new_weight) tuples.
*   **Real-time Queries:** The algorithm must be able to handle a large number of shortest path queries in real-time. After each set of graph updates, the system receives a batch of queries, each specifying a set of source and destination nodes.
*   **Memory Constraints:** The graph can be extremely large, so your solution must be memory-efficient. Storing the entire shortest path matrix is not feasible.
*   **Negative Edge Weights:** The graph does NOT contain negative edge weights.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the graph. The keys are node IDs (integers), and the values are lists of tuples, where each tuple represents an outgoing edge in the format `(neighbor_node_id, edge_weight)`.
*   `sources`: A list of source node IDs (integers).
*   `destinations`: A list of destination node IDs (integers).
*   `updates`: A list of tuples representing edge weight updates in the format `(start_node, end_node, new_weight)`.

**Output:**

*   For each query (a set of `sources` and `destinations`), return the length of the shortest path (sum of edge weights) from any node in `sources` to any node in `destinations`. Return `-1` if no path exists between any source and destination node.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph can be up to 10<sup>6</sup>.
*   The number of edges in the graph can be up to 10<sup>7</sup>.
*   The number of source and destination nodes in each query can be up to 10<sup>3</sup>.
*   The number of edge updates can be up to 10<sup>4</sup>.
*   Edge weights are positive integers in the range [1, 10<sup>3</sup>].
*   The number of queries after each update can be up to 10<sup>4</sup>.
*   The time limit for processing each set of updates and queries is strict (e.g., 5 seconds for a large test case). Your solution must be highly optimized.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    1: [(2, 2), (3, 5)],
    2: [(4, 1)],
    3: [(4, 3)],
    4: []
}
sources = [1, 3]
destinations = [4]
updates = []

# Expected output: 4 (Path 3 -> 4)

graph = {
    1: [(2, 2), (3, 5)],
    2: [(4, 1)],
    3: [(4, 3)],
    4: []
}
sources = [1]
destinations = [4]
updates = [(2, 4, 5)] # Update the weight of the edge 2->4 to 5

# After the update, the shortest path from 1 to 4 is now 1 -> 2 -> 4 (weight 2 + 5 = 7).
```

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The algorithm must correctly find the shortest path between the given source and destination nodes.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be highly efficient in terms of both time and memory usage. Solutions that time out or exceed memory limits will be rejected.
*   **Scalability:** The algorithm should be able to handle large graphs with a significant number of nodes and edges.
*   **Handling Dynamic Updates:** The algorithm must efficiently incorporate edge weight updates without requiring a complete recomputation of shortest paths.

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

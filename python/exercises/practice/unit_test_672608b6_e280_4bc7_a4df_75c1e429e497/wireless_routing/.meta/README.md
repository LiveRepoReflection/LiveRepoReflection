# Wireless Routing

This project implements an algorithm to find the optimal routing path in a wireless sensor network.

## Problem Description

In a wireless sensor network (WSN), `N` sensor nodes are distributed in a 2D plane. Each sensor node has a limited transmission range `R` and a battery level. A message needs to be delivered from a source node `S` to a destination node `D`, potentially through multiple hops.

Transmitting a message consumes energy proportional to the distance of the transmission. The goal is to find the minimum-hop path from source to destination, with the lowest total energy consumption.

## The Quantum Maze

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an algorithm to navigate a quantum maze. This maze exhibits probabilistic branching and quantum entanglement, making navigation far more complex than a classical maze.

The maze is represented as a directed graph where nodes are locations and edges are possible paths. Each edge has a probability associated with it, representing the likelihood of transitioning to the destination node when traversing that edge. The sum of probabilities of outgoing edges from any given node is always 1.

Furthermore, certain pairs of locations are *entangled*. When the "quantum particle" (your algorithm) visits one location in an entangled pair, the probabilities of edges emanating from the other location in the pair *instantaneously* change. Specifically, each edge probability from the entangled partner node is multiplied by a *coupling factor* specific to that edge. The sum of probabilities after this change need not be equal to one. After all these edges are updated, normalize all outgoing edges from the entangled partner node such that the sum of probabilities of outgoing edges from the entangled partner node sums to one. If the entangled partner node does not have outgoing edges, it is not normalized.

Your goal is to find the most probable path from a designated start node to a designated end node, given a set of entangled pairs and their respective coupling factors.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of locations in the maze (numbered 0 to N-1). (1 <= N <= 1000)
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, p)` represents a directed edge from location `u` to location `v` with probability `p` (0 <= u, v < N, 0 < p <= 1).
*   `entangled_pairs`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(a, b, couplings)` represents an entangled pair of locations `a` and `b`. `couplings` is a dictionary that maps destination location `v` (where `(b, v, _)` is an edge in `edges`) to a coupling factor. `couplings` can be an empty dict if no edges exist. The probability of edge `(b, v)` will be multiplied by `couplings[v]` when location `a` is visited. (0 <= a, b < N, a != b).
*   `start`: The starting location. (0 <= start < N)
*   `end`: The destination location. (0 <= end < N)

**Output:**

*   The probability of the most probable path from `start` to `end`. Return 0 if no path exists between the `start` and `end` nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Multiple paths may exist between the start and end nodes.
*   The probabilities are floating-point numbers. Use appropriate precision to avoid rounding errors.
*   The number of entangled pairs can be up to N/2
*   The size of the `couplings` dict can be between 0 and the number of outgoing edges from the entangled partner node.
*   Coupling factors can be zero or negative
*   The product of probabilities along any path and coupling factors must be a positive value.
*   For the same entangled pair, if the quantum particle visits either one of the entangled locations, only the edges on the other entangled location will be updated.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient enough to handle large mazes (up to 1000 locations) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., within 5 seconds).

**Scoring:**

*   Solutions will be judged based on correctness and efficiency. Test cases will include mazes with varying sizes, complexities, and entanglement configurations. Edge cases (e.g., disconnected graphs, invalid inputs) will also be tested.

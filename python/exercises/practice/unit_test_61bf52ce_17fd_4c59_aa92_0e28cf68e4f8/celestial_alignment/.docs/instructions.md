## The "Celestial Alignment Optimization" Problem

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a network of celestial observatories spread across the globe. Each observatory continuously monitors a specific set of celestial objects (stars, planets, galaxies). Due to varying weather conditions, equipment malfunctions, and scheduled maintenance, each observatory has a fluctuating "visibility score" for each object it monitors, representing the quality of the data it can collect.

Your task is to design an algorithm that optimally allocates observation time slots to observatories to maximize the overall scientific return. Each observatory has a limited number of time slots available per observation period. Further, there are dependencies between objects - observing one object at a certain time might significantly enhance (or hinder) the observation of another object at a later time.

Specifically, we want to maximize the weighted sum of visibility scores across all objects and all observatories, considering object dependencies and observatory capacity constraints.

**Input:**

The input data will be provided in the following format:

*   **Observatories:** A list of observatory IDs (strings).
*   **Objects:** A list of celestial object IDs (strings).
*   **Time Slots:** An integer representing the total number of available time slots.
*   **Observatory Capacities:** A dictionary where the key is an observatory ID and the value is an integer representing the maximum number of time slots that observatory can use.
*   **Visibility Scores:** A dictionary where the key is a tuple (observatory ID, object ID, time slot) and the value is a floating-point number representing the visibility score for observing that object at that time slot from that observatory. A missing entry implies a visibility score of 0.
*   **Object Dependencies:** A dictionary where the key is a tuple (object ID, time slot) and the value is another dictionary. This nested dictionary maps another tuple (object ID, time slot) to a floating-point dependency score. This dependency score represents how observing the first object at the first time slot affects the visibility score of the second object at the second time slot. A positive dependency score indicates an enhancement, while a negative score indicates a hindrance. Missing dependency score implies a value of 0.

**Output:**

Your algorithm should output a dictionary representing the optimal allocation of time slots. The key should be a tuple `(observatory ID, object ID, time slot)`, and the value should be a boolean `True` if that observatory is allocated to observe that object at that time slot, and `False` otherwise. Only include entries where the value is `True` in your output dictionary to reduce the size of output.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Capacity Constraints:** The total number of time slots allocated to each observatory must not exceed its capacity.
2.  **Non-overlapping Allocation:** Each observatory can only observe one object at a given time slot.
3.  **Object Dependencies:** The overall score must account for both visibility scores *and* the effects of object dependencies.
4.  **Optimization:** The algorithm must find an allocation that *maximizes* the overall score, which is defined as the sum of visibility scores plus the sum of dependency scores for all allocated time slots.
5.  **Efficiency:** The number of observatories, objects, and time slots can be large (up to 100 observatories, 100 objects, and 100 time slots). Your algorithm must be efficient enough to find a near-optimal solution within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 60 seconds).
6.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where visibility scores or dependency scores are negative. Handle cases where an observatory is incapable of observing a specific object (visibility score 0 for all time slots).
7.  **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If multiple allocations result in the same maximum score, any of these allocations is considered a valid solution.

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the total score it achieves. The higher the score, the better. Due to the computational complexity, a perfect solution may not be achievable within the time limit. The scoring will be relative to the best submitted solution.

This problem combines elements of resource allocation, optimization, and graph dependencies, requiring you to design a sophisticated algorithm that balances efficiency and accuracy. Good luck!

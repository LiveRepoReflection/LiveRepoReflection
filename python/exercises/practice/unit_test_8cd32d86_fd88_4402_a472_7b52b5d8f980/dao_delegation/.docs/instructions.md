## Problem: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Vote Delegation with Sybil Resistance

**Description:**

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) uses a token-based voting system to decide on proposals. Each token holder has voting power proportional to the number of tokens they hold. To improve participation and decentralization, the DAO is implementing a delegation mechanism allowing token holders to delegate their voting power to other addresses.

However, the DAO faces a significant challenge: Sybil attacks. Malicious actors can create numerous accounts and distribute small amounts of tokens across them, effectively amplifying their voting power when delegation is enabled. The DAO needs a Sybil resistance mechanism integrated with the delegation system.

To combat this, the DAO introduces a "Delegation Threshold" (`D`). Any account with a token balance *below* `D` cannot delegate their vote. This is aimed at discouraging the creation of small, Sybil-controlled accounts solely for delegation purposes.  The DAO also requires that all delegations are weighted by the square root of the delegator's token balance. This makes large delegations more impactful and reduces the influence of numerous small delegations.

You are tasked with implementing the vote aggregation logic for a given proposal.

**Input:**

*   `token_balances`: A dictionary where keys are account addresses (strings) and values are the number of tokens they hold (integers).
*   `delegations`: A dictionary where keys are delegator addresses (strings) and values are the delegatee address (string). A delegator can only delegate to one other address.
*   `delegation_threshold`: An integer representing the minimum token balance required for an account to delegate its vote.
*   `proposal_id`: An integer representing the ID of the proposal being voted on.

**Output:**

A dictionary where keys are account addresses and values are their total voting power (integers) for the given proposal. The voting power is calculated as follows:

1.  **Base Voting Power:** Each account's base voting power is equal to the number of tokens they hold.
2.  **Delegated Voting Power:** An account receives delegated voting power from other accounts if they are the delegatee. The delegated voting power is calculated as the sum of the square root of each delegator's token balance. Note that delegators must have a token balance above or equal to the `delegation_threshold` to be able to delegate.
3.  **Circular Delegation:** Circular delegation (e.g., A delegates to B, B delegates to A) is invalid. If a circular delegation is detected, ignore the entire delegation chain and do not include any of the votes from the participants in the cycle.
4.  **Self Delegation:** Self delegation (e.g., A delegates to A) is invalid and should be ignored.
5.  **Non-Existent Accounts:** If a delegation points to an account that does not exist in `token_balances`, the delegation is invalid and should be ignored.
6.  **Integer Casting:** Any decimals should be discarded when summing the voting powers.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of accounts (length of `token_balances`) can be up to 10,000.
*   Token balances are non-negative integers.
*   The `delegation_threshold` is a non-negative integer.
*   Delegations can form complex chains.
*   Your solution must be efficient to handle a large number of accounts and delegations. Aim for a time complexity better than O(N^2), where N is the number of accounts.

**Example:**

```python
token_balances = {
    "A": 100,
    "B": 50,
    "C": 20,
    "D": 5,
    "E": 0
}
delegations = {
    "A": "C",
    "B": "C",
    "D": "E"
}
delegation_threshold = 10
proposal_id = 123

# Expected Output:
# {
#     "A": 100,
#     "B": 50,
#     "C": 100 + 50 + 10,  # 100 (base) + sqrt(100) + sqrt(50) + sqrt(0)
#     "D": 5,
#     "E": 0 + 2 # 0 (base) + sqrt(5)
# }

# Note that the sqrt should return the integer part, e.g., sqrt(50) = 7
```

**Clarifications to consider to make code more robust:**

1.  Assume any missing keys in the provided dictionaries have value 0.
2.  Any errors or exceptions should be handled.
3.  Delegations that occur to non-existent accounts should be ignored.
4.  If token balances or delegation threshold are negative, revert to zero.
5.  If the delegation threshold is higher than the maximum token balance, there should be no delegations.

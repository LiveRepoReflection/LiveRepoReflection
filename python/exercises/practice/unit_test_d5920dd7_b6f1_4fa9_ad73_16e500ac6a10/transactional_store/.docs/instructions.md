Okay, I'm ready to design a challenging coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Snapshot Isolation

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed, transactional key-value store. This system should support multiple clients performing concurrent read and write operations, while guaranteeing snapshot isolation. This means that each transaction should operate on a consistent snapshot of the data, as it existed at the transaction's start time, regardless of concurrent modifications by other transactions.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Data Model:** The store holds string key-value pairs.

2.  **API:** Implement the following operations:

    *   `begin_transaction()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique transaction ID (TID).
    *   `read(TID, key)`: Reads the value associated with the given key within the context of the specified transaction. Returns `None` if the key does not exist or if the transaction is invalid (e.g., already committed or aborted).
    *   `write(TID, key, value)`: Writes the given value to the key within the context of the specified transaction.  If the transaction is invalid, the write should be ignored.
    *   `commit_transaction(TID)`: Attempts to commit the specified transaction. If successful, all writes performed by the transaction become visible to subsequent transactions. Return `True` on success and `False` on failure (due to conflicts or invalid TID).
    *   `abort_transaction(TID)`: Aborts the specified transaction. All writes performed by the transaction are discarded. Return `True` on success, `False` if TID is invalid.

3.  **Snapshot Isolation:** Your implementation MUST guarantee snapshot isolation.  Transactions should read from a consistent snapshot of the data, unaffected by concurrent writes from other committed transactions.

4.  **Concurrency:** The system must handle concurrent transactions from multiple clients.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.

5.  **Durability:**  While full durability is not required for this problem, your implementation should be reasonably robust against simple failures (e.g., process restarts). Consider how you would approach persisting the necessary metadata for transaction management.

6.  **Optimization:** Optimize for read performance, given a workload with significantly more reads than writes. Minimize the overhead associated with snapshot isolation.

7.  **Scalability (Conceptual):** While you don't need to implement actual distribution, discuss in your code comments how your design could be extended to a distributed environment (e.g., sharding, replication, consensus).

**Constraints:**

*   The key-value store should reside in memory. Disk-based storage is not required.
*   Assume a single-node deployment for the core implementation.  The focus is on concurrency and snapshot isolation.
*   The number of concurrent transactions can be large (e.g., thousands).
*   Key and value sizes can be up to 1KB.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Reading a key that has been written but not yet committed by the same transaction.
*   Writing to a key multiple times within the same transaction. The last write should be the value used upon commit.
*   Committing a transaction that depends on uncommitted writes from another transaction (should not be possible with snapshot isolation).
*   Committing or aborting a transaction more than once.
*   "Write Skew" (a classic problem in concurrent transactions that snapshot isolation should prevent).

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the implementation correctly implement snapshot isolation and handle concurrent transactions without data corruption?
*   Performance:  Is the read performance optimized?
*   Concurrency Handling:  Are race conditions properly handled?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and documented?
*   Scalability Discussion:  Does the code contain a discussion of how to extend the design to a distributed environment?

Good luck!

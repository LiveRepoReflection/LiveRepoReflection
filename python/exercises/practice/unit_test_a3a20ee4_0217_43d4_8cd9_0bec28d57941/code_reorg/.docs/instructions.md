## Question Description

A large software company, "OmniCorp," is struggling with code maintainability. Their codebase has evolved organically over many years, resulting in a tangled web of dependencies and redundant code. To improve efficiency and reduce bugs, OmniCorp wants to reorganize its codebase into a modular structure.

The codebase can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent code modules, and edges represent dependencies. A dependency from module `A` to module `B` means that module `A` uses functionality provided by module `B`.

OmniCorp wants to group these modules into a set of independent "components." A component is a set of modules. The goal is to minimize dependencies *between* components while ensuring that all modules within a component are strongly related.

**Specifically, a valid component decomposition must satisfy the following conditions:**

1.  **Complete Coverage:** Every module belongs to exactly one component.
2.  **Acyclic Component Dependency:** After collapsing each component into a single node, the resulting graph of components must also be a DAG. This is to avoid circular dependencies between components.  If component A contains module a, and component B contains module b, and there is a dependency a -> b, then there is a dependency A -> B.  The component graph must be a DAG.
3.  **Component Size Limit:** Each component can have at most `K` modules.  This is to keep components manageable.

**The objective is to find a valid component decomposition that minimizes the number of inter-component dependencies.** An inter-component dependency is a dependency `A -> B` where module `a` in component `A` depends on module `b` in component `B` and `A != B`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of modules (nodes in the DAG), numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `M`: The number of dependencies (edges in the DAG).
*   `dependencies`: A list of tuples `(u, v)` representing a dependency from module `u` to module `v`.
*   `K`: The maximum number of modules allowed in a single component.

**Output:**

A list of lists, where each inner list represents a component and contains the module IDs belonging to that component. The order of components and module IDs within each component does not matter.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 1000
*   0 <= `M` <= `N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   1 <= `K` <= `N`
*   The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
*   There exists at least one valid component decomposition.

**Example:**

```
N = 6
M = 7
dependencies = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
K = 3

Possible Output:
[[0, 1, 2], [3], [4, 5]]
```

**Explanation of the example:**

*   We have 6 modules and 7 dependencies.
*   Each component can have at most 3 modules.
*   One possible decomposition is:
    *   Component 1: \[0, 1, 2]
    *   Component 2: \[3]
    *   Component 3: \[4, 5]
*   Dependencies within components: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1,2) if modules 1 and 2 were in the same component
*   Inter-component dependencies: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) if modules 4 and 5 were in different components.
*   The number of inter-component dependencies must be minimized.

**Optimization Requirements:**

Your solution should aim to minimize the number of inter-component dependencies. Suboptimal solutions that satisfy the constraints but result in a significantly higher number of inter-component dependencies may not pass all test cases. Consider using appropriate algorithms and data structures to achieve efficient and effective component decomposition. Think about how to balance component size with the number of dependencies crossing component boundaries. Heuristic approaches might be necessary for larger inputs.

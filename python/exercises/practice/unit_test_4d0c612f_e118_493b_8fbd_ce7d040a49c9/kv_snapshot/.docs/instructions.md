## Question: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Snapshot Isolation

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed, transactional key-value store with snapshot isolation.  This store operates across multiple nodes. Your solution must ensure data consistency, even in the face of concurrent transactions and node failures.

**System Architecture:**

Imagine a cluster of `N` nodes, each holding a portion of the key-value data.  A client can connect to *any* node to initiate a transaction.  Keys are strings, and values are arbitrary byte arrays.

**Transaction Semantics:**

Transactions are ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  Specifically, you need to implement:

*   **Atomicity:**  All operations within a transaction either succeed or fail as a single unit.  If any part of the transaction fails, all changes must be rolled back.
*   **Consistency:**  Transactions must maintain the data store's integrity. For this problem, assume the data store itself guarantees single-key consistency (e.g., a simple increment operation on a single key is always consistent).
*   **Isolation:**  **Snapshot Isolation**.  Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database as of the time the transaction started.  Writes made by concurrent transactions are not visible until the transaction commits.
*   **Durability:** Once a transaction commits, the changes are persisted and survive node failures. (You don't need to handle full disk persistence for this problem, but your design should be compatible with later addition of persistence.)

**API:**

You need to implement the following operations:

*   `begin_transaction()`:  Starts a new transaction.  Returns a transaction ID (string).
*   `read(transaction_id, key)`:  Reads the value associated with `key` within the context of the given `transaction_id`. Returns the value (byte array) or None if the key doesn't exist.  Must respect snapshot isolation.
*   `write(transaction_id, key, value)`:  Writes the `value` to the `key` within the context of the given `transaction_id`.  The write is buffered and not immediately visible to other transactions.
*   `commit_transaction(transaction_id)`:  Attempts to commit the transaction.  If no conflicts are detected, the transaction is committed, and the changes are made visible. Returns `True` on success, `False` on abort (due to conflict).
*   `abort_transaction(transaction_id)`: Aborts the transaction, discarding all changes.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Consensus:**  Use a consensus algorithm (like Paxos or Raft - you don't need to implement these, you can assume a library/framework that provides it) for committing transactions.  Each node must participate in the consensus process to ensure atomicity and durability. You should clearly define which data needs to be agreed upon by the consensus algorithm.

2.  **Snapshot Isolation Implementation:** Implement snapshot isolation using a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) approach. Each write operation creates a new version of the data associated with a timestamp.  Reads must access the correct version based on the transaction's start timestamp.

3.  **Conflict Detection:** Detect write-write conflicts during the commit phase. If two concurrent transactions have written to the same key, and the first transaction to commit wins, the second transaction must be aborted.

4.  **Scalability:** Your design should scale to a large number of nodes and clients.  Consider how you would partition the data across the nodes and how you would handle load balancing.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** Your system should tolerate node failures.  If a node fails, the system should continue to operate, and data should not be lost. The consensus algorithm will handle the data replication and recovery for you.

6.  **Performance:**  Optimize for read performance.  Reads should be as fast as possible, even under heavy write load.

7.  **Concurrency:**  Your solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent transactions correctly.

8.  **Edge Cases:** Consider scenarios like:

    *   Reading a key that doesn't exist.
    *   Committing an already committed or aborted transaction.
    *   Aborting an already committed or aborted transaction.
    *   Node failures during different phases of a transaction (e.g., during the write phase, during the commit phase).
    *   Network partitions.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Does the system correctly implement ACID properties and snapshot isolation?
*   **Performance:**  How quickly can the system handle reads and writes under different workloads?
*   **Scalability:**  How well does the system scale to a large number of nodes and clients?
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  How well does the system tolerate node failures?
*   **Code Quality:**  Is the code well-structured, easy to understand, and maintainable?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, transactional semantics, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

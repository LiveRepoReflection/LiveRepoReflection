## Question: The Interdimensional Cable Network

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the routing of interdimensional cable channels across a vast network of interconnected realities. Each reality (dimension) is represented as a node in a graph. Cable channels are represented as weighted, directed edges between these realities. The weight of an edge represents the cost of transmitting a single unit of data across that cable.

The Interdimensional Cable Network (ICN) has a unique constraint: due to the volatile nature of interdimensional travel, data packets can only traverse a maximum of *K* dimensions (edges) to reach their destination. Going beyond *K* hops risks data corruption and network instability.

You are given a list of realities (nodes) `realities` represented by unique string identifiers, a list of cable connections (edges) `cables` in the format `(source, destination, cost)`, a source reality `start`, a destination reality `end`, and the maximum number of allowed hops `K`.

Your goal is to find the *minimum* total cost to transmit data from the `start` reality to the `end` reality, adhering to the *K* hop limit. If no path exists within the hop limit, return -1.

**Input:**

*   `realities`: A list of strings representing the unique identifiers for each reality (node).
*   `cables`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(source, destination, cost)` represents a directed cable connection from reality `source` to reality `destination` with a cost of `cost`. All `source` and `destination` will be present in `realities`.
*   `start`: A string representing the starting reality.
*   `end`: A string representing the destination reality.
*   `K`: An integer representing the maximum number of allowed hops.

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the minimum cost to transmit data from `start` to `end` within `K` hops. Return -1 if no such path exists.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The number of realities can be large (up to 1000).
*   The number of cables can be significantly larger than the number of realities (up to 5000).
*   Cable costs are non-negative integers.
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Multiple cables may exist between the same two realities with different costs. You should consider the lowest cost cable between any two realities.
*   The value of K can range from 0 to 100.
*   The solution must be efficient. Naive approaches may result in timeouts. Consider the time and space complexity of your solution.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.

**Example:**

```
realities = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
cables = [("A", "B", 1), ("B", "C", 2), ("A", "C", 5), ("C", "D", 1), ("A", "D", 10)]
start = "A"
end = "D"
K = 2

Output: 6 (A -> B -> C -> D within 2 hops is not possible, so A -> C -> D is the best option with a cost of 5 + 1 = 6 )
```

```
realities = ["A", "B", "C"]
cables = [("A", "B", 1), ("B", "C", 2)]
start = "A"
end = "C"
K = 1

Output: -1 (No path from A to C exists within 1 hop)
```

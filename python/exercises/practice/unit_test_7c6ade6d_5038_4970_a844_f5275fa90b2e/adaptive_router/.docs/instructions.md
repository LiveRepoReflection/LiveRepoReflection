## Question: Network Congestion Control with Adaptive Routing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a network congestion control mechanism with adaptive routing for a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes (numbered from 0 to N-1) connected by a network. Each node can send messages to any other node. The network links have limited bandwidth, and congestion can occur if too many messages are routed through the same links.

Your goal is to implement a routing algorithm that dynamically adapts to network congestion by selecting the best path for each message based on real-time network conditions. "Best" means minimizing the estimated time it will take for a message to arrive at its destination.

**Input:**

1.  `N`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 5000).
2.  `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, capacity)` represents a bidirectional network link between node `u` and node `v` with a given `capacity` (1 <= capacity <= 1000). The graph formed by these edges is guaranteed to be connected. You can assume there are at most 2*N edges.
3.  `requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(source, destination, message_size)` represents a request to send a message of `message_size` (1 <= message_size <= 100) from node `source` to node `destination`.
4.  `initial_load`: A dictionary, where keys are tuples `(u, v)` representing edges, and values are the current load of each edge.

**Output:**

A list of lists, where each inner list represents the path taken for each request. Each path should be a list of node IDs, starting with the source node and ending with the destination node.  If no path is found return `None`.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Adaptive Routing:**  Your routing algorithm must dynamically adapt to network congestion.  It should consider the current load on each link when selecting a path.
2.  **Congestion Metric:** You need to come up with a heuristic or metric (e.g., estimated transmission time) to quantify network congestion on each link.  This metric should factor into the path selection process. A simple approach could be `load / capacity`, but you are encouraged to explore more sophisticated metrics.
3.  **Path Selection:** Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, A*) that uses your congestion metric to find the "best" path for each request. The best path is defined as the path that is estimated to have the lowest total cost (based on your congestion metric) for transmitting the message.
4.  **Load Balancing:** The algorithm should attempt to distribute traffic across the network to avoid overloading any single link.
5.  **Scalability:** Your solution should be reasonably efficient for a network of up to 5000 nodes and a moderate number of requests. Consider time complexity when designing your algorithm.
6.  **Real-world Constraints:** Consider the real-world implications of routing decisions. For example, avoid constantly changing routes for the same source-destination pair, as this can lead to instability. You can add a small penalty for switching paths.
7.  **Tie-breaking:** If multiple paths have the same estimated cost, your algorithm should have a deterministic way of breaking ties (e.g., choose the path with the smallest node IDs).
8.  **Invalid Requests:** If there is no path between the source and destination for a request, return `None` for that request's path.
9.  **Side Effects:** Do not modify the input data structures (e.g., `edges`, `requests`). Modifying the `initial_load` is allowed.
10. **Optimization:** The overall time taken for message to arrive at the destination node is the main goal. Any other optimization is second priority.
11. **No External Libraries:** You can only use built-in python libraries.
12. **Handling edge cases:** You must be able to handle edge cases correctly, especially when the network is heavily congested or when there are multiple equally "good" paths.

**Example:**

```python
N = 4
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 7), (2, 3, 1)]
requests = [(0, 3, 5), (1, 3, 3)]
initial_load = {(0, 1): 0, (1, 0): 0, (0, 2): 0, (2, 0): 0, (1, 2): 0, (2, 1): 0, (1, 3): 0, (3, 1): 0, (2, 3): 0, (3, 2): 0}

# Expected output (example - actual paths may vary based on your implementation):
# [[0, 2, 3], [1, 3]]
```

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Correctness:** The paths returned must be valid (i.e., they connect the source and destination nodes) and must avoid exceeding the capacity of any link.
2.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be able to handle networks of up to 5000 nodes and a moderate number of requests within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1 minute).
3.  **Adaptability:** The routing algorithm should demonstrate the ability to adapt to network congestion and choose paths that minimize the estimated transmission time.
4.  **Load Balancing:** The algorithm should distribute traffic across the network to avoid overloading any single link.
5.  **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires you to combine knowledge of graph algorithms, data structures, and network congestion control principles. Good luck!

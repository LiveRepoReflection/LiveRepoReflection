Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem. Good luck!

### Question Description

You are tasked with simulating and optimizing traffic flow in a simplified city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are intersections and edges are road segments connecting intersections. Each road segment has a capacity (maximum number of cars it can hold) and a free-flow travel time (time it takes to traverse when the road is empty).

The city experiences dynamic traffic patterns throughout the day. You are given a series of time snapshots, each representing the number of cars entering each road segment at a particular time. Your goal is to determine the optimal traffic light timings at each intersection for each time snapshot to minimize the average travel time across all cars in the city, subject to the road capacity constraints.

**Specifically:**

1.  **City Representation:** The city is represented by a dictionary `city` where keys are intersection IDs (integers) and values are lists of outgoing road segments. Each road segment is a tuple `(destination_intersection, capacity, free_flow_time)`. For example:

    ```python
    city = {
        0: [(1, 100, 5), (2, 50, 10)],  # Intersection 0 has roads to 1 and 2
        1: [(2, 75, 7)],
        2: []
    }
    ```

2.  **Traffic Snapshots:** You are given a list of traffic snapshots `snapshots`. Each snapshot is a dictionary where keys are tuples representing road segments `(source_intersection, destination_intersection)` and values are the number of cars entering that road segment at that time. For example:

    ```python
    snapshots = [
        {(0, 1): 50, (0, 2): 20, (1, 2): 30},  # Snapshot at time 0
        {(0, 1): 70, (0, 2): 30, (1, 2): 40}   # Snapshot at time 1
    ]
    ```

3.  **Traffic Lights:** Each intersection has a set of traffic lights controlling the outgoing road segments. You can control the duration (in seconds) for which each light is green. The sum of green light durations for all outgoing road segments at an intersection must equal a fixed cycle length `cycle_length`.

4.  **Travel Time Calculation:** The travel time for a car on a road segment depends on the number of cars on the road. You can use a simple linear model:

    ```
    travel_time = free_flow_time * (1 + (num_cars_on_road / capacity))
    ```

    Cars entering a road segment at a particular time snapshot are assumed to remain on that segment for the duration of their travel time. Cars are processed first-in-first-out based on light duration.

5.  **Optimization:** Your task is to write a function `optimize_traffic(city, snapshots, cycle_length)` that returns a list of traffic light schedules, one for each snapshot. Each schedule should be a dictionary where keys are intersection IDs and values are dictionaries representing the green light durations for each outgoing road segment. The keys for the nested dictionaries are the destination intersection IDs. Example:

    ```python
    #Possible output
    [
        {0: {1: 30, 2: 30}, 1: {2: 60}},  # Schedule for snapshot 0
        {0: {1: 40, 2: 20}, 1: {2: 60}}   # Schedule for snapshot 1
    ]
    ```

    The schedule should minimize the *average* travel time across all cars across the entire city for that snapshot, subject to the following constraints:

    *   Road capacity constraints (number of cars on a road segment cannot exceed its capacity).
    *   Traffic light cycle length constraint (sum of green light durations must equal cycle length).
    *   Green light durations must be non-negative.

**Constraints:**

*   The city graph can be complex (multiple paths between intersections, cycles).
*   The number of intersections and road segments can be large (up to 100 intersections, 200 road segments).
*   The number of snapshots can be large (up to 50).
*   The cycle length is fixed for all intersections and all snapshots.
*   You must handle the case where traffic flow exceeds capacity.
*   Finding the *absolute* optimal solution may be computationally infeasible for large cities and many snapshots. Aim for a solution that provides a significant improvement over a naive approach (e.g., equal green light durations).
*   Function execution time is limited (e.g., 10 seconds per test case).

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a more sophisticated traffic flow model (e.g., using queuing theory).
*   Consider the impact of traffic light synchronization between neighboring intersections.
*   Implement a learning-based approach to adapt traffic light timings over time based on observed traffic patterns.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques (linear programming, gradient descent, or heuristics), and careful consideration of time complexity. Good luck!

## The Optimal Logistics Network

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing the optimal logistics network for a massive e-commerce company, "OmniDeliver," to minimize delivery times and costs across a sprawling metropolitan area. The city is represented as a weighted graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent delivery hubs, warehouses, and customer zones. Each node has a geographical location (x, y coordinates).
*   **Edges:** Represent potential transportation routes between nodes. Each edge has a weight representing the *estimated* travel time (in minutes) between the connected nodes. This travel time takes into account factors like distance, traffic conditions, and road quality. OmniDeliver uses various types of vehicles: drones, vans, and trucks, and each edge can only support a subset of vehicle types, given as a set of strings (e.g., `{"drone", "van"}`).

OmniDeliver has a central warehouse (node 0) and must deliver packages to `N` customer zones (nodes 1 to N). Each customer zone `i` has a specific *delivery deadline* `D_i` (in minutes, relative to the current time). Furthermore, each customer zone `i` has a *package volume* `V_i`.

OmniDeliver can use a fleet of `K` vehicles. Each vehicle has:

*   A maximum *travel time capacity* `T` (in minutes). A vehicle cannot travel for longer than `T` minutes in total.
*   A *vehicle type* (e.g., "drone", "van", "truck"). A vehicle can only travel on edges that support its vehicle type.
*   A *package volume capacity* `C`. The sum of the `V_i` of customer zones it delivers to must be less than or equal to `C`.

**Objective:**

Your goal is to determine the *minimum number of vehicles* required to deliver all packages to all customer zones *before their respective deadlines*. If it is impossible to deliver all packages within the deadlines and constraints, return -1.

**Input Format:**

*   `N`: The number of customer zones (1 <= N <= 15).
*   `K`: The total number of available vehicles (1 <= K <= 1000).
*   `graph`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents an edge: `(node1, node2, travel_time, vehicle_types)`. `node1` and `node2` are integers representing the node IDs, `travel_time` is an integer, and `vehicle_types` is a set of strings.
*   `D`: A list of integers, where `D[i]` is the delivery deadline for customer zone `i+1` (the deadline for the warehouse (node 0) is implicitly infinite).
*   `V`: A list of integers, where `V[i]` is the package volume for customer zone `i+1` (the package volume for the warehouse (node 0) is implicitly 0).
*   `T`: The maximum travel time capacity for each vehicle.
*   `C`: The package volume capacity for each vehicle.
*   `vehicle_types`: A list of vehicle types available to OmniDeliver. The length of the list is equal to `K`, with each element being a string representing the vehicle type.

**Constraints:**

*   Node IDs are integers from 0 to N (inclusive).
*   Travel times are non-negative integers.
*   Deadlines are positive integers.
*   Package volumes are positive integers.
*   The graph may not be complete, and there may be multiple paths between nodes.
*   You must use Dijkstra's algorithm or similar to compute the shortest path between the warehouse and each customer zone, respecting vehicle type constraints.
*   Optimize for the *minimum* number of vehicles used.
*   The problem is NP-hard; finding the absolute optimal solution may be infeasible within a reasonable time limit. Focus on developing a good heuristic or approximation algorithm.
*   1 <= N <= 15
*   1 <= K <= 1000
*   1 <= travel_time <= 100
*   1 <= D[i] <= 1000
*   1 <= V[i] <= 100
*   1 <= T <= 1000
*   1 <= C <= 1000

**Output Format:**

Return an integer representing the minimum number of vehicles required to deliver all packages on time. Return -1 if it's impossible to deliver all packages within the given constraints.

**Example:**

```python
N = 3
K = 3
graph = [
    (0, 1, 10, {"van", "drone"}),
    (0, 2, 15, {"truck"}),
    (1, 2, 5, {"van"}),
    (1, 3, 12, {"drone"}),
    (2, 3, 8, {"truck", "van"}),
]
D = [25, 30, 40]  # Deadlines for zones 1, 2, and 3
V = [50, 60, 70]  # Package volumes for zones 1, 2, and 3
T = 60
C = 150
vehicle_types = ["van", "truck", "drone"]

# Expected output (this is just an example; the correct answer may vary based on the optimal solution):
# 2
```

**Scoring:**

Partial scores will be awarded based on the correctness of the solution and its efficiency in terms of the number of vehicles used. Solutions that fail to meet the deadlines will receive zero points. Solutions that time out will also receive zero points.

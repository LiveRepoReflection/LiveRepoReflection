## Project Name

`OptimalRoutePlanner`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal route planner for a logistics company that needs to deliver packages across a large, interconnected network of cities. The network is represented as a weighted graph where cities are nodes and roads connecting them are edges. Each road has a *variable traversal time* based on the time of day and traffic conditions, making this a time-dependent routing problem.

The company uses a fleet of identical delivery drones. Your goal is to determine the fastest route for a single drone to deliver a package from a designated source city to a destination city, considering the dynamic road traversal times.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The road network is represented as an adjacency list. Each city is identified by a unique integer ID. The weight of an edge represents the *base travel time* (in minutes) on that road under ideal conditions (e.g., minimal traffic).

2.  **Time-Dependent Travel Time:** The actual travel time on a road depends on the *departure time* from the source city of that road. You will be given a function, `get_travel_time(source_city, dest_city, departure_time)`, which takes the source city, destination city, and departure time (in minutes from the start of the day) as input and returns the *actual* travel time (in minutes) for that road. This function simulates real-time traffic data and can return different travel times for the same road at different times of the day. The time returned is a floating-point number.

3.  **Departure Window:** The drone can only depart from the source city within a specified *departure window*. This is defined by a start time and an end time (in minutes from the start of the day). The drone can depart at any minute within this window (integer values only).

4.  **Optimization Goal:** Find the *earliest possible arrival time* at the destination city, considering all possible departure times within the departure window and the time-dependent travel times on the roads.

5.  **Constraints:**
    *   The number of cities `N` is up to 100.
    *   The number of roads `M` is up to 500.
    *   Base travel times are positive integers.
    *   The departure window can be up to 24 hours (1440 minutes).
    *   `get_travel_time()` calls are computationally expensive. Your solution should aim to minimize the number of calls to this function.
    *   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
    *   There are no negative travel times.
    *   If no route is possible within the given time constraints, return -1.

6.  **Input:**
    *   `graph`: A dictionary representing the adjacency list. Keys are city IDs (integers), and values are lists of tuples `(neighbor_city_id, base_travel_time)`.
    *   `source_city`: The ID of the starting city (integer).
    *   `destination_city`: The ID of the destination city (integer).
    *   `departure_window_start`: The start time of the departure window (in minutes from the start of the day, integer).
    *   `departure_window_end`: The end time of the departure window (in minutes from the start of the day, integer).
    *   `get_travel_time`: A function with signature `get_travel_time(source_city, dest_city, departure_time)` that returns the actual travel time on a road.

7.  **Output:**
    *   The earliest possible arrival time at the destination city (in minutes from the start of the day, integer). Return -1 if no route is possible.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    0: [(1, 10), (2, 15)], # City 0 is connected to City 1 with base travel time 10 and City 2 with base travel time 15.
    1: [(0, 10), (3, 20)],
    2: [(0, 15), (3, 30)],
    3: [(1, 20), (2, 30)]
}
source_city = 0
destination_city = 3
departure_window_start = 600  # 10:00 AM
departure_window_end = 660  # 11:00 AM

def get_travel_time(source, dest, time):
  # Simplified example: Add some time based on departure time.
  base_times = { (0, 1): 10, (1, 0): 10, (0, 2): 15, (2, 0): 15, (1, 3): 20, (3, 1): 20, (2, 3): 30, (3, 2): 30 }
  base_time = base_times[(source,dest)]
  return base_time + (time % 60) / 10.0 # add up to 5.9 to the base time.

earliest_arrival = solve(graph, source_city, destination_city, departure_window_start, departure_window_end, get_travel_time)
print(earliest_arrival)
```

**Challenge:**

The primary challenge lies in efficiently exploring the search space of possible departure times and routes while minimizing calls to the `get_travel_time()` function. Consider using intelligent search strategies, heuristics, and pruning techniques to optimize your solution. Standard pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's will need to be adapted to handle the time-dependent nature of the graph and the limited departure window.

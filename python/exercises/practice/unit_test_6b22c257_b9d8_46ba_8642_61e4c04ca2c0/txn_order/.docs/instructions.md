Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging programming competition problem. Here it is:

**Problem: Distributed Transaction Ordering and Conflict Resolution**

**Description:**

You are building a distributed database system that supports multi-object transactions.  Transactions can read and write data across multiple nodes in the system.  To ensure data consistency and atomicity, you need to implement a robust transaction ordering and conflict resolution mechanism.

Each transaction consists of a series of operations (reads and writes) on data objects identified by unique keys.  These operations are initially proposed by clients. The system must then determine a global order for these transactions and resolve any conflicts that arise when multiple transactions attempt to modify the same data.

Specifically, each transaction *T* is represented as a tuple: `(transaction_id, operations)`, where `transaction_id` is a unique identifier (string) and `operations` is a list of operations. Each operation is a tuple: `(operation_type, key, value)`, where `operation_type` can be 'READ' or 'WRITE', `key` is a unique identifier for the data object (string), and `value` is the value to be written (string).  Reads return the current committed value for the specified key.

Your task is to implement a function `execute_transactions(transactions, initial_data)` that takes a list of transactions and a dictionary representing the initial state of the database (`initial_data`) and returns a tuple `(committed_data, transaction_results)`.

*   `committed_data`: A dictionary representing the final, committed state of the database after all transactions have been executed.
*   `transaction_results`: A dictionary where the keys are `transaction_id`s and the values are lists representing the results of each operation. Each element of the result list is either the value read by a 'READ' operation or 'OK' for a 'WRITE' operation that successfully committed. If a transaction is aborted due to a conflict, its corresponding value in `transaction_results` should be 'ABORTED'.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Atomicity:** All operations within a transaction must either succeed or fail as a whole. If any operation in a transaction fails (due to a conflict), the entire transaction must be aborted.
2.  **Consistency:** The database must remain in a consistent state after each transaction.
3.  **Isolation:** Transactions should be isolated from each other as much as possible.  While a strict serializability isn't strictly enforced, you must prevent dirty reads and lost updates.
4.  **Total Order:** You *must* implement a centralized transaction ordering mechanism using a Lamport Timestamp based approach. Assume you have access to a `generate_timestamp()` function (provided in the code template) that returns a globally increasing integer. Each transaction is assigned a timestamp at the beginning of its execution, and transactions are processed in timestamp order.
5.  **Conflict Detection:** Implement a simple locking mechanism. Before a transaction can execute a 'WRITE' operation, it must acquire a write lock on the corresponding key. Before a transaction can execute a 'READ' operation, it must acquire a read lock on the corresponding key.  Multiple transactions can hold read locks on the same key simultaneously, but only one transaction can hold a write lock on a key at any given time.  A transaction cannot acquire a lock if another transaction already holds a conflicting lock.  If a transaction cannot acquire a lock, it must be aborted.
6.  **Deadlock Prevention:**  To prevent deadlocks, transactions acquire locks in the order of the keys involved in the transaction, sorted lexicographically. If a transaction needs to acquire a lock that it currently owns, the transaction should immediately proceed.
7.  **Resource Management:**  Ensure locks are released when a transaction commits or aborts.
8.  **Error Handling:**  Handle cases where a transaction attempts to read or write a key that does not exist in the initial data.  Attempting to read a non-existent key should return "KEY_NOT_FOUND". Attempting to write a non-existent key should create the key.
9.  **Scalability Considerations (Implicit):** While not strictly measurable, your design should be mindful of potential scalability bottlenecks in a real-world distributed system. Consider aspects like lock contention and centralized timestamp generation. This is not part of the automated judging but will be considered during manual review.
10. **Optimized Performance:** Aim for efficient lock management and conflict detection to handle a large number of concurrent transactions. The judging system will test your code with datasets that include various levels of contention.

**Input:**

*   `transactions`: A list of transactions, where each transaction is a tuple `(transaction_id, operations)`.
*   `initial_data`: A dictionary representing the initial state of the database.

**Output:**

*   A tuple `(committed_data, transaction_results)`, where `committed_data` is a dictionary representing the final state of the database, and `transaction_results` is a dictionary containing the results of each transaction.

**Example:**

```python
transactions = [
    ("T1", [("WRITE", "A", "10"), ("READ", "A", None)]),
    ("T2", [("WRITE", "A", "20"), ("READ", "A", None)]),
]
initial_data = {"A": "0"}

# Expected (Example):
# committed_data = {"A": "20"} (Order T1 then T2 or T2 then T1 is possible depending on timestamp)
# transaction_results = {"T1": ["OK", "10"], "T2": ["OK", "20"]}  OR
# transaction_results = {"T2": ["OK", "20"], "T1": ["OK", "20"]}
```

**Code Template (Python):**

```python
import threading

transaction_lock = threading.Lock()
data_lock = threading.Lock()

This problem requires the candidate to design and implement a robust concurrency control mechanism, considering aspects like locking, conflict resolution, deadlock prevention, and atomicity. It tests their understanding of distributed systems principles and their ability to translate those principles into code. Good luck!

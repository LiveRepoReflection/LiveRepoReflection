def optimize_multi_commodity_flow(nodes, edges, commodities):
    """
    Optimize the flow of multiple commodities through a network.
    
    Args:
        nodes (list): List of node identifiers in the graph.
        edges (dict): Adjacency list representation of the graph.
                     Keys are node identifiers, values are lists of tuples (neighbor, cost_function).
                     Cost function is a list of (flow, cost) pairs representing a piecewise linear function.
        commodities (list): List of tuples (source, destination, demand) for each commodity.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are commodity indices and values are dictionaries mapping
              edges (as tuples of source-destination nodes) to the flow of that commodity on that edge.

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a programmer's understanding of graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world constraints.

**Project Name:** `CriticalNetworkNodes`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a resilient communication network for a distributed system. The network consists of `N` nodes (numbered from 0 to N-1) and `M` bidirectional communication links connecting these nodes.

Due to budget constraints, you need to identify the *minimum* set of nodes that, if removed, would disconnect the network into at least `K` separate connected components. Removing a node also removes all links connected to it.

A connected component is a set of nodes where there is a path between any two nodes in the set.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup>).
*   `M`: The number of communication links (0 <= M <= min(N\*(N-1)/2, 2\*10<sup>5</sup>)).
*   `links`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a bidirectional communication link between nodes `u` and `v` (0 <= u, v < N, u != v).
*   `K`: The target number of connected components after removing the critical nodes (1 <= K <= N).

**Output:**

*   A list of integers representing the *minimum* set of nodes to remove, sorted in ascending order. If no such set exists, return an empty list. If multiple such sets exist, return the lexicographically smallest set.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient for large networks (up to 10<sup>5</sup> nodes and 2\*10<sup>5</sup> edges).  Consider time complexity. Solutions with O(N<sup>3</sup>) complexity or higher are unlikely to pass all test cases.
2.  **Minimum Set:** You must find the *smallest* possible set of nodes that satisfy the disconnection requirement.
3.  **Lexicographical Order:** If multiple minimum sets exist, return the set that comes first in lexicographical order.
4.  **Connected Components:** After removing the nodes, correctly identify the number of remaining connected components.
5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the initial network is already disconnected, where removing any single node disconnects the network more than required, and where no solution is possible. Consider cases where K > 1.
6.  **Memory:** Your solution should be memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large graphs.
7.  **Correctness:**  Your solution must produce correct results for all valid inputs, including complex network topologies.
8.  **No Duplicates:** The output list must not contain duplicate node IDs.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
M = 4
links = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
K = 3

Output: [1, 3]  (Removing nodes 1 and 3 disconnects the network into 3 components: [0], [2], [4])
```

**Rationale for Difficulty:**

*   This problem combines graph traversal (finding connected components) with a search problem (finding the minimum set of nodes).
*   The optimization requirement (finding the *minimum* set) forces candidates to explore potentially all combinations or use a greedy approach if a more performant solution is not possible.
*   The lexicographical order requirement adds a subtle constraint to the search.
*   Large input sizes demand efficient algorithms and data structures, precluding brute-force approaches.
*   The edge cases and constraints make this a problem that requires careful consideration of both algorithmic design and implementation details.
*   Potentially suitable graph algorithms like Tarjan's algorithm or Kosaraju's algorithm could be incorporated for identifying strongly connected components which is a common algorithm pattern.

This problem challenges programmers to think critically about graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and the importance of handling edge cases effectively. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard difficulty level, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization, and a real-world scenario:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Validator**

**Problem Description:**

You are building a distributed system that processes financial transactions. To ensure data consistency across multiple services, you need to implement a robust transaction validation service. This service receives a stream of transaction records from various sources and must determine whether a proposed "global transaction" (composed of multiple individual transactions) is valid according to a complex set of inter-transaction dependencies and constraints.

Each transaction record contains the following information:

*   `transaction_id`: A unique string identifier for the transaction.
*   `account_id`: A string identifier for the account involved in the transaction.
*   `amount`: An integer representing the transaction amount (positive for credit, negative for debit).
*   `timestamp`: An integer representing the time the transaction occurred (Unix epoch time).
*   `dependencies`: A list of `transaction_id` strings that this transaction depends on. A transaction cannot be considered valid until all its dependencies are valid and have been processed.

A "global transaction" is defined as a set of transactions that are logically related and should be treated as a single unit of work. The system provides you with a list of `transaction_id`s that belong to a single global transaction.

Your task is to write a function `validate_global_transaction(transactions, global_transaction_ids)` that takes the following inputs:

*   `transactions`: A list of transaction records (dictionaries as described above). Assume that transactions are not necessarily provided in chronological order or in dependency order.
*   `global_transaction_ids`: A list of `transaction_id` strings that represent the transactions belonging to the global transaction being validated.

Your function should return `True` if the global transaction is valid, and `False` otherwise.

**Validation Rules:**

1.  **Dependency Resolution:** All transactions within the global transaction, and *all* their transitive dependencies (transactions that the global transaction transactions depend on, and transactions that *those* transactions depend on, and so on), must be present in the `transactions` list. If any dependency is missing, the global transaction is invalid.

2.  **Account Balance Consistency:** For each account involved in the global transaction (including all transitive dependencies), the sum of all transaction amounts for that account *must* be non-negative at *every timestamp*.  In other words, no account can go into a negative balance at any point in time during the transaction history.

3.  **No Circular Dependencies:** The dependency graph formed by the transactions (including transitive dependencies) *must* be acyclic. Circular dependencies will cause the system to enter an infinite loop.

4.  **Timestamp Consistency:**  A transaction's timestamp must be later than or equal to all of its direct dependencies.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of transactions in the `transactions` list can be very large (up to 10<sup>5</sup>).
*   The number of transactions in the `global_transaction_ids` list can be up to 10<sup>3</sup>.
*   The depth of the dependency tree can be significant.
*   The timestamp values can be large integers.
*   Optimize for both time and space complexity. Naive solutions will likely time out.
*   The input transactions can contain transactions that are not part of the global transaction being validated. Your solution should efficiently filter out irrelevant transactions.

**Example Input (Illustrative):**

```python
transactions = [
    {"transaction_id": "A", "account_id": "X", "amount": 100, "timestamp": 10, "dependencies": []},
    {"transaction_id": "B", "account_id": "X", "amount": -50, "timestamp": 20, "dependencies": ["A"]},
    {"transaction_id": "C", "account_id": "Y", "amount": 200, "timestamp": 15, "dependencies": []},
    {"transaction_id": "D", "account_id": "Y", "amount": -250, "timestamp": 25, "dependencies": ["B", "C"]},
    {"transaction_id": "E", "account_id": "Z", "amount": 50, "timestamp": 5, "dependencies": []},
    {"transaction_id": "F", "account_id": "Z", "amount": -20, "timestamp": 30, "dependencies": ["E"]},
]

global_transaction_ids = ["D"]
```

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Empty `transactions` list.
*   Empty `global_transaction_ids` list.
*   `global_transaction_ids` containing transaction IDs that don't exist in `transactions`.
*   Transactions with no dependencies.
*   Transactions with self-dependencies (A depends on A).
*   Large dependency chains.
*   Large number of transactions for the same account.
*   A global transaction encompasses all transactions in the system.

This problem is designed to require a combination of graph traversal, topological sorting (for cycle detection and dependency ordering), and careful management of account balances and timestamps. Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial for achieving acceptable performance with the specified constraints. Good luck!

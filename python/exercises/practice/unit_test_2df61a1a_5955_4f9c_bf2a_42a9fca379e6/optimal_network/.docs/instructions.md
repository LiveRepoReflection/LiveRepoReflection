Okay, here's a high-difficulty Python coding problem designed to be challenging and incorporate many of the elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkDesign`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a resilient communication network for a critical infrastructure system. The network consists of `n` nodes (numbered from 0 to `n-1`) and can have up to `m` possible bidirectional communication links between these nodes. Each possible link has a cost associated with its construction and a probability of failure.

Your goal is to select a subset of these links to build a network that satisfies the following criteria:

1.  **Connectivity:** The resulting network must be connected.  That is, there must be a path between any two nodes in the network.

2.  **Resilience:** The network must be resilient to node failures.  Specifically, after removing *any single* node and its connected links, the remaining network must *still* be connected.

3.  **Cost Optimization:**  Among all networks satisfying the connectivity and resilience requirements, you must find the one with the *minimum total construction cost*.

4.  **Failure Probability Constraint:** The *product* of the failure probabilities of the links you *do* choose must be *less than or equal to* a given threshold `P`.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (integer, `3 <= n <= 15`).
*   `m`: The number of possible links (integer, `0 <= m <= n*(n-1)/2`).
*   `links`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a possible link in the format `(node1, node2, cost, failure_probability)`.  `node1` and `node2` are integers representing the connected nodes (0-indexed). `cost` is an integer representing the cost of building the link, and `failure_probability` is a float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability that the link will fail. Note that links are bidirectional.
*   `P`: The maximum allowed product of failure probabilities for the selected links (float, `0.0 < P <= 1.0`).

**Output:**

*   Return the *minimum total construction cost* of a network that satisfies the connectivity, resilience, and failure probability constraints.  If no such network exists, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= n <= 15`
*   `0 <= m <= n*(n-1)/2`
*   All node pairs in `links` are unique (e.g., you won't have both (0, 1, ...) and (1, 0, ...)).
*   `1 <= cost <= 1000` for each link.
*   `0.0 < failure_probability <= 1.0` for each link.
*   `0.0 < P <= 1.0`
*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Brute-force solutions will likely time out.

**Example:**

```python
n = 4
m = 5
links = [
    (0, 1, 10, 0.1),
    (0, 2, 15, 0.2),
    (1, 2, 20, 0.3),
    (1, 3, 25, 0.4),
    (2, 3, 30, 0.5)
]
P = 0.05

# A possible solution would be to select links (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (2,3).
# This network is connected and resilient.
# Total cost = 10 + 15 + 25 + 30 = 80
# Product of failure probabilities = 0.1 * 0.2 * 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.004, which is <= P

# Another possible solution is links (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (0, 3)
# This network is connected and resilient.
# Total cost = 10 + 20 + 30 + 0 = 60
# Product of failure probabilities = 0.1 * 0.3 * 0.5 * 0 = 0, which is <= P

# The optimal solution is to select links (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3,0).
# This network is connected and resilient.
# Total cost = 10 + 15 + 25 + 30 + 0 = 80
# Product of failure probabilities = 0.1 * 0.2 * 0.4 * 0.5 * 0 = 0, which is <= P
# Therefore, your function should return 60.
```

**Hints (but still challenging!):**

*   Bit manipulation can be useful for representing subsets of links.
*   Consider using graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) to check connectivity.
*   Think about how to efficiently check the resilience constraint.  You don't need to recompute connectivity from scratch for each node removal.
*   Dynamic programming or branch-and-bound techniques might be helpful for optimization.

This problem requires a combination of graph theory, algorithm design, and optimization techniques.  Good luck!

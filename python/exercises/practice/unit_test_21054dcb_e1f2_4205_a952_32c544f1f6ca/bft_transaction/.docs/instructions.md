## Problem: Distributed Transaction Manager with Byzantine Fault Tolerance

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly reliable and scalable distributed transaction manager (DTM) in Python. This DTM will be responsible for coordinating transactions across multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) while guaranteeing atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties, even in the presence of Byzantine faults.

**Byzantine Faults:** Unlike simple crash faults, Byzantine faults involve services behaving arbitrarily, potentially sending incorrect or malicious messages. This makes consensus much harder to achieve.

**System Architecture:**

The DTM consists of a cluster of `n` DTM nodes. Each service participating in a distributed transaction interacts with *at least* `f+1` DTM nodes, where `f` is the maximum number of Byzantine faulty DTM nodes the system can tolerate. Ideally, `n = 3f + 1` is used to guarantee safety and liveness. This means the system can tolerate up to `f` faulty nodes and still function correctly.

**Transaction Flow:**

1.  **Initiation:** A client (or service) initiates a distributed transaction by sending a transaction request to *at least* `f+1` DTM nodes. The request includes operations to be performed on various services, along with any necessary data.
2.  **Preparation:** Upon receiving a transaction request, each DTM node performs the following:
    *   Validates the request (e.g., checks signatures, permissions).
    *   Sends a "prepare" message to the relevant services, instructing them to prepare for the transaction (e.g., perform necessary locks, create shadow copies).
    *   Records its decision (prepare or abort) in its local persistent storage.
    *   Communicates its decision to *all* other DTM nodes.
3.  **Consensus:** DTM nodes use a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm (e.g., Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance - PBFT) to agree on the outcome of the transaction (commit or abort). The consensus should tolerate up to `f` faulty nodes.
4.  **Commit/Abort:** Once a consensus is reached, each DTM node sends a "commit" or "abort" message to the services involved in the transaction.
5.  **Completion:** Services execute the transaction (commit or rollback) and acknowledge completion to the DTM nodes.
6.  **Finalization:** DTM nodes persist the final outcome of the transaction.

**Requirements:**

1.  **BFT Consensus:** Implement a PBFT-like consensus algorithm to ensure agreement on the transaction outcome even with Byzantine faults. You can simplify PBFT but need to address the key concepts like pre-prepare, prepare, commit phases, and view changes.
2.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must tolerate up to `f` Byzantine faulty DTM nodes. Implement mechanisms to detect and handle incorrect messages or malicious behavior from faulty nodes. You should provide ways to simulate the Byzantine faults.
3.  **Atomicity:** Ensure that all operations within a transaction either succeed or fail together, even in the presence of failures.
4.  **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes must be persisted and survive system crashes.
5.  **Scalability:** The DTM should be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions.
6.  **Efficiency:** The consensus algorithm should be efficient and minimize communication overhead.
7.  **Security:** Protect against malicious clients or services attempting to compromise the system. Transaction requests must be signed (you can simulate this using simple shared secrets) to prevent tampering and replay attacks.
8.  **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to aid in debugging and auditing.
9.  **Configuration:** The system should be configurable, allowing you to specify the number of DTM nodes (`n`), the fault tolerance level (`f`), and other parameters.

**Constraints:**

*   You can simulate the interactions with the services (databases, message queues, etc.). You don't need to implement actual service integrations.
*   You can use threading or asynchronous programming to handle concurrency.
*   You can use any suitable Python libraries for cryptography, networking, and data serialization.
*   Assume a partially synchronous network model (i.e., message delays are bounded, but the bound is unknown).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the DTM correctly coordinate transactions and guarantee ACID properties under normal conditions and in the presence of Byzantine faults?
*   Fault Tolerance: Can the system tolerate up to `f` faulty nodes and still function correctly?
*   Performance: How efficiently does the DTM handle concurrent transactions?
*   Scalability: How well does the DTM scale as the number of transactions and DTM nodes increases?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Security: Does the system adequately protect against malicious attacks?
*   Completeness: Are all the required features implemented?

This problem challenges you to design and implement a practical and robust distributed transaction manager that can withstand Byzantine faults, a critical requirement for building reliable and trustworthy distributed systems. Good luck!

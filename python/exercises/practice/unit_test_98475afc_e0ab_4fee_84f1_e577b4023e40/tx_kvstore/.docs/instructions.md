Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging programming competition problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Conflict Resolution

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed, transactional key-value store. Imagine a cluster of *N* nodes, each capable of storing key-value pairs.  Your system must support the following operations, ensuring ACID properties:

*   **`put(key, value, transaction_id)`:** Stores a `value` associated with a `key` within a given `transaction_id`.
*   **`get(key, transaction_id)`:** Retrieves the `value` associated with a `key` within a given `transaction_id`.  If the key doesn't exist, return `None`.
*   **`commit(transaction_id)`:**  Atomically commits all changes associated with a given `transaction_id`. All nodes must reach a consistent state after the commit.
*   **`rollback(transaction_id)`:** Rolls back all changes associated with a given `transaction_id`, discarding them entirely.
*   **`snapshot(timestamp)`**: Return the database snapshot at a given `timestamp`

**Concurrency and Conflicts:**

Multiple transactions can be active concurrently. When concurrent transactions attempt to modify the same key, conflicts can arise. You must implement a conflict resolution mechanism. Implement a **Last-Writer-Wins** conflict resolution policy. Meaning, the transaction that commits last for a specific key takes precedence.

**Distribution and Fault Tolerance:**

The key-value store is distributed across *N* nodes. For simplicity, assume a consistent hashing scheme where each key is assigned to a specific node.  Implement basic fault tolerance. If a node fails *after* a `commit()` operation has been acknowledged, the data must still be accessible from other nodes. You do *not* need to handle node failures during a transaction (i.e., before `commit()` or `rollback()`). Assume there is a mechanism to detect node failures.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** While *N* is relatively small for testing (e.g., 3-5 nodes), your design should *theoretically* be scalable to a larger number of nodes. Consider how your design would behave with hundreds or thousands of nodes.
*   **Efficiency:**  `get()` operations should be as fast as possible. `put()` and `commit()` operations can be slower but should still aim for reasonable performance.  Minimize network communication where possible.
*   **Data Consistency:** Your implementation **must** ensure data consistency across all nodes after a `commit()`.
*   **Transaction Isolation:** Transactions should be isolated from each other until committed. A `get()` within a transaction should only see changes made within that transaction or committed transactions.
*   **Immutability**: Data should be immutable. Every time a value is updated, create a new copy of it
*   **Ordering**: Implement timestamp ordering, assuming the transactions are time stamped.

**Input/Output:**

You are free to define the interface for interacting with your system. However, it must be clear how to perform the operations described above. Your system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Does your system correctly implement the required operations and handle conflicts?
*   **Concurrency:**  Does your system handle concurrent transactions safely and efficiently?
*   **Performance:**  How fast are `get()`, `put()`, and `commit()` operations?
*   **Scalability:**  How well does your design scale to a larger number of nodes? (This will be assessed conceptually, not through actual large-scale testing).
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Can your system recover from a single node failure after a `commit()`?
*   **Code Quality:**  Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

**Bonus Points:**

*   Implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanism (e.g., optimistic locking).
*   Implement data replication for improved fault tolerance.
*   Implement techniques to reduce network communication during commit (e.g., using Paxos or Raft consensus algorithms - only conceptual explanation is sufficient, no need to implement full consensus).

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems principles, concurrency control, and data structures. Good luck!

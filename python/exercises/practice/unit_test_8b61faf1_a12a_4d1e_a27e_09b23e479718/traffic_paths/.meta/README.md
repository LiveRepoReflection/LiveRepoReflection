# Traffic Paths

This module implements an algorithm for optimal multi-source shortest paths with traffic simulation.

## Overview

The algorithm calculates the shortest paths from multiple source locations to all other locations in a road network, while also simulating dynamic traffic conditions. This can be useful for applications like emergency response planning, logistics optimization, and intelligent transportation systems.

## Key Features

- Multi-source shortest path calculations
- Dynamic traffic congestion simulation
- Time-dependent edge weights
- Performance optimized for large graphs
- Thread-safe implementation

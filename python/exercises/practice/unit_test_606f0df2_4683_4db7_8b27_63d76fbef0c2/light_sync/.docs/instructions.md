Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging and require a sophisticated approach:

**Problem:  Optimal Traffic Light Synchronization**

**Description:**

You are given a road network represented as a weighted, directed graph. Each node in the graph represents an intersection, and each directed edge represents a road segment connecting two intersections.  The weight of each edge represents the time (in seconds) it takes to travel along that road segment.

Each intersection (node) has a traffic light. The traffic light cycles through a green and red phase.  All traffic lights have the *same* cycle duration `T` (in seconds), but each traffic light can have a different *offset* within that cycle. An offset of `0` means the light turns green at time `0`, `T`, `2T`, and so on. An offset of `k` means the light turns green at time `k`, `T+k`, `2T+k`, and so on. The light is red at all other times.

Specifically, at intersection `i`, let `offset[i]` be the offset of the traffic light. At time `t`, a vehicle can only enter intersection `i` if `t % T >= offset[i]` and `t % T < offset[i] + G`, where `G` is the duration of the green light (in seconds), and `0 < G < T`. If a vehicle arrives at the intersection during the red phase, it must wait until the next green phase begins before proceeding.  The waiting time is the difference between the start of the next green phase and the arrival time.

Your task is to find the *optimal* set of traffic light offsets (`offset[i]` for each intersection `i`) that minimizes the *maximum* travel time between a given source intersection `S` and a given destination intersection `D`. You are allowed to choose any integer offset between `0` and `T-1` (inclusive) for each intersection.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of intersections (nodes in the graph). Intersections are numbered from `0` to `N-1`.
*   `M`: The number of road segments (edges in the graph).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a directed edge from intersection `u` to intersection `v` with travel time `w` (in seconds).
*   `S`: The source intersection (integer between `0` and `N-1`).
*   `D`: The destination intersection (integer between `0` and `N-1`).
*   `T`: The traffic light cycle duration (in seconds).
*   `G`: The duration of the green light (in seconds).

**Output:**

The minimum possible *maximum* travel time from `S` to `D`, considering all possible offset configurations.  If there is no path from `S` to `D`, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `0 <= M <= N * (N - 1)`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `1 <= w <= 100`
*   `0 <= S, D < N`
*   `1 <= T <= 100`
*   `1 <= G < T`
*   The graph may contain cycles.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle the given constraints.  A brute-force approach that tries all possible offset combinations will likely time out. Consider algorithmic optimizations and efficient data structures.
*   The evaluation will be based on the correctness of the output and the efficiency of the solution.  Solutions that are significantly slower than the optimal solution may receive a lower score.

**Edge Cases:**

*   No path exists between `S` and `D`.
*   `S` and `D` are the same intersection.
*   The graph is disconnected.
*   The travel time `w` is significantly larger than `T`.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path), modular arithmetic (traffic light timing), and optimization techniques.  Good luck!

## Question: Real-Time Ride Matching in a Dynamic City

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a real-time ride matching system for a ride-sharing company operating in a large, dynamic city. The city can be represented as a weighted graph, where nodes represent locations and edges represent road segments with associated travel times (weights).

The system needs to efficiently handle a continuous stream of rider requests and driver availability updates. Rider requests specify a pickup location, a destination location, and a maximum acceptable wait time. Driver availability updates specify the driver's current location and their availability status (available or unavailable).

The goal is to match riders to available drivers in a way that minimizes the overall waiting time for riders while adhering to the constraints below.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Real-Time Performance:** The system must process rider requests and driver updates with minimal latency. Ideally, matching decisions should be made within milliseconds.

2.  **Optimal Matching:** For each rider request, the system should find the closest available driver (in terms of estimated travel time) who can reach the rider's pickup location within the rider's maximum acceptable wait time.

3.  **Dynamic Updates:** The system must handle frequent updates to driver locations and availability. A driver may become unavailable (e.g., due to a completed ride or a break) or change their location.

4.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent riders and drivers, as well as a large city graph.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be designed to be resilient to failures. If a component fails, the system should continue to operate without significant disruption.

6.  **Consider Traffic:** The travel time between two locations can change dynamically based on real-time traffic conditions.  The system should incorporate these traffic updates into its route calculations. The traffic updates are provided as a stream of changes to the edge weights in the city graph.

7.  **Ride Cancellation:** Riders may cancel their requests before being matched. The system must handle these cancellations gracefully and release any reserved drivers.

**Input:**

*   **City Graph:** A weighted graph representing the city's road network. The graph is provided in a standard format (e.g., adjacency list with edge weights representing travel times).  Assume the number of nodes (locations) can be up to 10,000 and the number of edges (road segments) can be up to 50,000.
*   **Rider Requests:** A stream of rider requests, each containing:
    *   `rider_id`: Unique identifier for the rider.
    *   `pickup_location`: Node ID of the pickup location.
    *   `destination_location`: Node ID of the destination location.
    *   `max_wait_time`: Maximum acceptable wait time in seconds.
    *   `request_time`: Timestamp of the request.
*   **Driver Updates:** A stream of driver updates, each containing:
    *   `driver_id`: Unique identifier for the driver.
    *   `current_location`: Node ID of the driver's current location.
    *   `available`: Boolean indicating whether the driver is available.
    *   `update_time`: Timestamp of the update.
*   **Traffic Updates:** A stream of traffic updates, each containing:
    *   `start_node`: Node ID of the start node of the road segment.
    *   `end_node`: Node ID of the end node of the road segment.
    *   `new_travel_time`: New travel time for the road segment.
    *   `update_time`: Timestamp of the update.

**Output:**

*   For each rider request, output the `driver_id` of the matched driver, or "NO_MATCH" if no suitable driver is found.
*   The output should be generated in real-time as rider requests are processed.

**Constraints:**

*   The city graph is static except for the edge weights, which change dynamically due to traffic updates.
*   The number of concurrent riders and drivers can be up to 1,000 each.
*   The maximum acceptable wait time for riders can be up to 600 seconds.
*   The time complexity for matching a single rider to a driver should be optimized.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The system must correctly match riders to drivers, adhering to all constraints.
*   **Performance:** The system must process rider requests and driver updates with minimal latency.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent riders and drivers.
*   **Efficiency:** The system should use resources (CPU, memory) efficiently.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem challenges you to combine your knowledge of graph algorithms, data structures, and system design principles to create a robust and efficient real-time ride matching system.  Good luck!

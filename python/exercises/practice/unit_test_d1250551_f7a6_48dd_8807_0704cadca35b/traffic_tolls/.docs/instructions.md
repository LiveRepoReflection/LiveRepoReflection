Okay, here's a challenging problem description:

**Problem Title: Optimal Traffic Flow with Dynamic Tolls**

**Problem Description:**

A major city is experiencing severe traffic congestion during peak hours. To alleviate this, the city council has decided to implement a dynamic tolling system. The road network is represented as a weighted directed graph, where nodes represent intersections, and edges represent road segments connecting intersections. The weight of each edge represents the travel time (in minutes) along that road segment under ideal (no congestion) conditions.

The traffic volume on each road segment changes throughout the day. To model this, you are given a function, `predict_traffic(start_node, end_node, current_time)`, which estimates the *congestion factor* for each road segment at a given `current_time` (in minutes since the start of the day, 0-1439). This congestion factor is a multiplier that should be applied to the ideal travel time of the segment to obtain the actual travel time.  For example, if `predict_traffic(A, B, 600)` returns 2.0, the actual travel time from intersection A to intersection B at 10:00 AM (600 minutes past midnight) is twice the ideal travel time.

The city aims to minimize the *total social cost* of travel. This cost is calculated as the sum of the *actual travel time* of all commuters *plus* the *total toll revenue*.  The city can set tolls (non-negative integer values) on each road segment. The toll on a road segment is added to the actual travel time for any commuter using that segment.

Your task is to write a function `optimize_tolls(graph, source, destination, start_time, end_time, num_commuters, predict_traffic)` that determines the optimal toll for each road segment in the graph to minimize the total social cost.  The function should return a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the road segments (start_node, end_node), and the values are the optimal toll amounts for those segments.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the road network. Keys are start nodes, values are dictionaries mapping end nodes to ideal travel times (integers). Example: `graph = {'A': {'B': 10, 'C': 15}, 'B': {'D': 12}, 'C': {'D': 8}}`
*   `source`: The starting node for all commuters (string).
*   `destination`: The destination node for all commuters (string).
*   `start_time`: The start time for the simulation, in minutes since the start of the day (integer, 0-1439).
*   `end_time`: The end time for the simulation, in minutes since the start of the day (integer, 0-1439).
*   `num_commuters`: The number of commuters traveling from source to destination (integer).
*   `predict_traffic`: A function `predict_traffic(start_node, end_node, current_time)` that returns the congestion factor (float) for a given road segment at a specific time.

**Output:**

*   A dictionary where keys are tuples `(start_node, end_node)` representing road segments and values are the optimal toll amounts (integers) for those segments.  Road segments not present in the output dictionary should be considered to have a toll of 0.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 1000 nodes and 5000 edges).
*   `num_commuters` can be large (up to 10000).
*   The optimal tolls should be non-negative integers.
*   The runtime of your solution is critical. Solutions that are not efficient enough will not pass.  Aim for a time complexity better than exponential.
*   The `predict_traffic` function is a black box and you cannot modify it.  It can be computationally expensive to call, so minimize the number of calls.
*   Assume commuters always choose the path with the lowest *perceived* travel time (actual travel time + toll).
*   If multiple paths have the same lowest perceived travel time, assume commuters are evenly distributed among those paths.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {'A': {'B': 10, 'C': 15}, 'B': {'D': 12}, 'C': {'D': 8}}
source = 'A'
destination = 'D'
start_time = 540  # 9:00 AM
end_time = 600    # 10:00 AM
num_commuters = 100
def predict_traffic(start, end, time):
    if (start, end) == ('A', 'B'):
        return 1.5
    elif (start, end) == ('A', 'C'):
        return 2.0
    elif (start, end) == ('B', 'D'):
        return 1.0
    elif (start, end) == ('C', 'D'):
        return 1.2
    return 1.0

tolls = optimize_tolls(graph, source, destination, start_time, end_time, num_commuters, predict_traffic)
print(tolls)
# Expected output (example, the actual optimal tolls might be different):
# {('A', 'B'): 5, ('A', 'C'): 0, ('B', 'D'): 0, ('C', 'D'): 2}
```

**Grading Rubric:**

*   **Correctness (70%):**  The solution must produce the correct optimal tolls that minimize the total social cost. Test cases will include various graph structures, traffic patterns, and numbers of commuters.
*   **Efficiency (30%):** The solution must be efficient enough to handle large graphs and a significant number of commuters within a reasonable time limit.  Solutions with excessive runtime will be penalized or fail.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path), optimization techniques, and careful consideration of time complexity. Good luck!

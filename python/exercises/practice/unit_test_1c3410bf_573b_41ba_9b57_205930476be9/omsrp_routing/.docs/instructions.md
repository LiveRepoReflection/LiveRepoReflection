## Problem: Optimized Multi-Source Routing Protocol (OMSRP)

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a core component of an Optimized Multi-Source Routing Protocol (OMSRP) for a highly dynamic network. The network consists of nodes (represented by integers) and weighted edges that indicate the cost of communication between nodes. Due to frequent node failures and link congestion, the network topology changes rapidly.

Your component is responsible for efficiently finding the *k* best (lowest cost) paths from *multiple* source nodes to a *single* destination node, subject to strict constraints on path length and node/edge diversity. "Best" paths are defined as paths having the smallest total cost.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the network graph. Keys are node IDs (integers), and values are dictionaries mapping neighbor node IDs to edge costs (integers). The graph is undirected (if `graph[a][b]` exists, then `graph[b][a]` also exists, and they have the same cost).
*   `sources`: A list of source node IDs (integers).
*   `destination`: The destination node ID (integer).
*   `k`: The number of best paths to find (integer).
*   `max_path_length`: The maximum number of edges a path can contain (integer). This is a hard constraint.
*   `min_node_diversity`: The minimum number of *distinct* nodes required across *all k* paths (integer). The destination node *does not* count towards this diversity.
*   `min_edge_diversity`: The minimum number of *distinct* edges required across *all k* paths (integer).

**Output:**

A list of the *k* best paths (lists of node IDs representing the path) from any of the source nodes to the destination node, sorted in ascending order of path cost.  If fewer than *k* paths exist, return all available paths. If no paths exist, return an empty list.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Graph Size:** The graph can be large (up to 1000 nodes and 5000 edges).
2.  **Dynamic Topology:** Assume the graph is relatively static during a single function call, but can change significantly between calls.  Precomputation is therefore not beneficial between calls.
3.  **Edge Costs:** Edge costs are non-negative integers.
4.  **Path Length:** The `max_path_length` constraint is critical.  Paths exceeding this length are invalid.
5.  **Diversity:** `min_node_diversity` and `min_edge_diversity` are *combined* constraints across *all k* paths.  You must prioritize finding paths that satisfy these diversity requirements as much as possible *while still minimizing path cost*.  If it's impossible to find *k* paths that fully satisfy the diversity requirements, return the *k* best paths that *maximize* both node and edge diversity, prioritizing node diversity in case of a tie.
6.  **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.  Naive approaches will likely time out.  Consider algorithmic optimizations and appropriate data structures.
7.  **Multiple Paths:** Multiple paths may exist between any two nodes.  Your solution must be able to find and evaluate different paths.
8.  **Path Cost Calculation:** The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.
9.  **Path Representation:** A path is represented as a list of node IDs, starting with a source node and ending with the destination node.
10. **No cycles**: the same node cannot exist twice in one path.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    1: {2: 1, 3: 5},
    2: {1: 1, 4: 2, 5: 7},
    3: {1: 5, 6: 3},
    4: {2: 2, 7: 4},
    5: {2: 7, 7: 1},
    6: {3: 3, 7: 9},
    7: {4: 4, 5: 1, 6: 9}
}
sources = [1, 3]
destination = 7
k = 3
max_path_length = 4
min_node_diversity = 5
min_edge_diversity = 4

# Expected Output (example - the exact paths and costs will depend on the implementation):
# [[1, 2, 4, 7], [3, 6, 7], [1,3,6,7]]
```

**Grading Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:**  Does the solution produce the correct *k* best paths?
*   **Efficiency:**  Does the solution meet the time and space complexity requirements for large graphs?
*   **Diversity:** Does the solution effectively prioritize node and edge diversity while minimizing path cost?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** Does the solution correctly handle edge cases such as disconnected graphs, no paths found, and invalid input parameters?

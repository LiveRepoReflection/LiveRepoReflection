Okay, here's a challenging programming problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world aspects.

### Question Description

You are a network security analyst tasked with identifying anomalies in network traffic. You have access to a massive stream of network flow records. Each record represents a connection between two IP addresses over a certain period.

Each record contains the following information:

*   `start_time`: Timestamp (Unix epoch seconds) indicating when the connection started.
*   `source_ip`: Source IP address (string).
*   `destination_ip`: Destination IP address (string).
*   `bytes_sent`: Number of bytes sent from source to destination during the connection (integer).
*   `bytes_received`: Number of bytes received by the source from the destination during the connection (integer).

Your goal is to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting specific destination IP addresses.

A DDoS attack is characterized by:

1.  **High Volume:** A significantly larger number of connections to a target IP address within a short time window than the historical average.
2.  **Multiple Sources:**  The connections originate from a large and diverse set of source IP addresses.
3.  **Sustained Activity:**  The high volume of connections persists for a certain duration.

You need to implement a function `detect_ddos(flow_records, time_window, threshold_factor, min_source_ips, attack_duration)` that takes the following inputs:

*   `flow_records`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a network flow record as described above. The records are assumed to be sorted by `start_time` in ascending order.  This list is *very large* and may not fit entirely into memory at once (assume it is streamed).
*   `time_window`: An integer representing the time window (in seconds) to analyze for connection volume.
*   `threshold_factor`: A float representing the factor by which the current connection volume must exceed the historical average to be considered anomalous (e.g., 3.0 means 3 times the average).
*   `min_source_ips`: An integer representing the minimum number of unique source IP addresses required within the `time_window` for the activity to be considered a potential DDoS attack.
*   `attack_duration`: An integer representing the minimum duration (in seconds) for which the anomalous behavior must persist to be considered a confirmed DDoS attack.

The function should return a list of strings, where each string is a destination IP address that is identified as the target of a confirmed DDoS attack. The list should contain only unique destination IPs and can be in any order.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Efficiency:** The `flow_records` list can be extremely large. Your solution must be optimized to process the data efficiently, minimizing memory usage and processing time.  Avoid loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
*   **Historical Average:**  You do not have pre-calculated historical averages. You must maintain and update the historical average connection volume for each destination IP address as you process the flow records. Use a suitable method for efficiently calculating and updating the rolling average.
*   **Streaming Data:**  Assume the `flow_records` are coming in as a stream.  You need to process them incrementally.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Empty `flow_records` list.
    *   Zero `time_window`, `threshold_factor`, `min_source_ips`, or `attack_duration`.
    *   Destination IPs with very little or no historical data.
*   **Data Structures:**  Choose appropriate data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of information, considering the large scale of the data.
*   **Real-world Considerations:**  Simulate a real-world scenario where network traffic patterns can change over time. Your rolling average should adapt to these changes. Consider using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) or similar technique.
*   **Accuracy:** Aim for high accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks while minimizing false positives.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a simplified set of `flow_records`, and you call `detect_ddos(flow_records, 60, 2.0, 10, 300)`.  The function should analyze the flow records, calculate the rolling average connection volume for each destination IP, and identify those destination IPs that experience a sustained high volume of connections from many different source IPs for at least 300 seconds, exceeding twice the historical average within any 60-second window. The function would then return a list containing those destination IPs.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a dictionary to store the rolling average connection volume for each destination IP.
*   Use a sliding window technique to efficiently count connections within the `time_window`.
*   Implement a mechanism to track the start and end times of potential DDoS attacks for each destination IP to ensure the `attack_duration` criterion is met.
*   Use a `set` data structure to keep track of unique source IPs within the time window.
*   Think about how to expire old data to keep the memory usage low.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and network security concepts, as well as the ability to write efficient and well-optimized code. Good luck!

## Question: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Simulation and Governance

**Description:**

You are tasked with creating a simulation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and implementing a sophisticated governance system. The DAO manages a portfolio of crypto assets and needs to make decisions about allocating these assets to various projects (e.g., investing in new DeFi protocols, providing liquidity, staking, etc.). The DAO operates on a token-based voting system, but participation is not guaranteed, and malicious actors may attempt to manipulate the system.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **DAO Data Structure:** Design a robust data structure to represent the DAO. This should include:
    *   A list of members, each represented by a unique ID and a quantity of governance tokens.
    *   A portfolio of crypto assets, each with a name (e.g., ETH, BTC, DAI) and a quantity.
    *   A record of past and current proposals.

2.  **Proposal System:** Implement a system for creating, submitting, and executing proposals.
    *   Each proposal should have:
        *   A unique ID.
        *   A description of the proposed action (e.g., "Invest 1000 DAI in Protocol X").
        *   A set of parameters specific to the proposal (e.g., Protocol X's address, expected ROI).
        *   A voting deadline (a block number or timestamp).
        *   Voting results (for, against, abstain).
        *   Execution status (pending, executed, rejected).

3.  **Voting Mechanism:** Implement a token-weighted voting mechanism.
    *   Members can vote for, against, or abstain on a proposal.
    *   The voting power of each member is proportional to the number of governance tokens they hold.
    *   Votes must be recorded immutably.
    *   Implement a snapshot mechanism to record token balances at the time of proposal creation to prevent last-minute vote buying.

4.  **Quorum and Thresholds:** Define configurable quorum and threshold requirements for proposals to pass.
    *   Quorum: The minimum percentage of total governance tokens that must participate in a vote for it to be valid.
    *   Threshold: The minimum percentage of "for" votes required for a proposal to be approved.

5.  **Execution Engine:** Implement a system for executing approved proposals. This is a simulation, so you don't need to interact with a real blockchain. The execution should:
    *   Verify that the proposal has passed the quorum and threshold requirements.
    *   Simulate the transfer of assets within the DAO's portfolio based on the proposal's parameters.
    *   Update the DAO's data structures accordingly.

**Advanced Challenges and Constraints:**

*   **Sybil Resistance:** Implement a mechanism to mitigate Sybil attacks (where a single actor creates multiple accounts to gain influence). Consider using a quadratic voting scheme or requiring members to stake a portion of their tokens to participate in governance.

*   **Time-Locking:** Add a time-lock mechanism to proposal execution. Once a proposal is approved, it cannot be executed immediately but must wait for a specified period. This provides time for members to review the outcome and potentially initiate a "rage quit" mechanism (withdrawing their assets proportionally if they disagree with the decision).

*   **Delegated Voting:** Allow members to delegate their voting power to other members. Implement a system for tracking delegations and ensuring that votes are properly attributed.

*   **Malicious Proposal Detection:** Implement a system to detect and flag potentially malicious or harmful proposals. This could involve analyzing the proposal's description and parameters for suspicious keywords or patterns.

*   **Gas Optimization:** (Even in simulation) Consider the efficiency of your algorithms and data structures. Large DAOs with many members and proposals can generate significant computational overhead. Optimize your code to minimize resource usage.

*   **Immutability and Auditability:** Ensure that all voting records and proposal execution logs are stored immutably and are easily auditable. This is crucial for maintaining trust and transparency within the DAO. (consider using a linked list to act as a simple ledger).

*   **Scalability:** Design your solution with scalability in mind. How will your system perform as the DAO grows in size and activity? Consider using techniques such as sharding or caching to improve performance.

*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Zero token balances.
    *   Division by zero errors.
    *   Invalid proposal parameters.
    *   Concurrent proposal submissions.
    *   Changing token balances during a vote.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does your system accurately simulate the behavior of a DAO governance system?
*   Efficiency: Is your code optimized for performance and scalability?
*   Robustness: Does your system handle edge cases and potential attacks gracefully?
*   Design: Is your code well-structured, modular, and easy to understand?
*   Completeness: Does your solution address all of the core requirements and advanced challenges?

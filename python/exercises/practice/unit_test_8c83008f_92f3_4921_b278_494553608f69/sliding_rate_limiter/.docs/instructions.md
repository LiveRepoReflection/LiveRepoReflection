`Distributed Rate Limiter with Sliding Window`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter with a sliding window algorithm. This rate limiter will be used to protect a critical service from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. The service has multiple instances running behind a load balancer. The rate limiter must:

*   **Enforce Rate Limits:** Allow a maximum number of requests within a given time window.
*   **Sliding Window:** Implement a sliding window to track requests, providing more accurate rate limiting compared to fixed windows.
*   **Distributed Operation:** Coordinate rate limiting decisions across multiple service instances.
*   **High Performance:** Minimize latency overhead on request processing.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Continue to function correctly even if some rate limiter components fail.
*   **Configurability:** Allow dynamic adjustment of rate limits without service restarts.
*   **Concurrency:** Handle concurrent requests efficiently.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **`is_allowed(client_id: str, request_timestamp: int) -> bool`:** This function determines whether a request from a given `client_id` is allowed at a specific `request_timestamp` (Unix timestamp in seconds). It should return `True` if the request is allowed and `False` otherwise.

2.  **`update_limit(client_id: str, new_limit: int, window_size: int) -> None`:** This function allows you to update the rate limit for a specific `client_id`. The `new_limit` specifies the maximum number of requests allowed within the `window_size` (in seconds).

3.  **Data Persistence:** The rate limiter must persist request counts and configurations. Consider using an external data store (e.g., Redis, Memcached, a distributed database) to ensure data consistency across all service instances and durability in case of failures.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of service instances can vary.
*   The number of unique `client_id` values can be very large (e.g., millions).
*   The rate limit can be different for each `client_id`.
*   The `request_timestamp` is provided in seconds since the Unix epoch.
*   The `window_size` is in seconds.
*   Minimize the impact on request latency. The `is_allowed` function must be highly performant.
*   The solution should be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests correctly.
*   Consider the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to dynamically adjust the rate limits based on real-time service load.
*   Add metrics and monitoring to track the rate limiter's performance.
*   Consider different data structures and algorithms for the sliding window to optimize performance and memory usage (e.g., sorted sets, circular buffers).
*   Implement a "circuit breaker" pattern to prevent cascading failures in case the rate limiter becomes unavailable.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. The best solutions will demonstrate a well-reasoned approach to handling the constraints and trade-offs involved in building a highly scalable and reliable rate limiter.

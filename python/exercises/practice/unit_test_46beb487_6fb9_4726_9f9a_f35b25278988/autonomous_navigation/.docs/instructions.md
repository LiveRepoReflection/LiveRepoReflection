Okay, I'm ready to design a challenging Python coding problem. Here it is:

### Question Description

Imagine you are developing the navigation system for an autonomous delivery robot operating in a dense, dynamic warehouse environment.  The warehouse is represented as a grid graph where each cell can be either:

*   **Empty:** The robot can freely move through this cell.
*   **Obstacle:** The robot cannot enter this cell (e.g., shelving, machinery).
*   **Charging Station:** The robot can recharge at this cell.
*   **Delivery Point:** The robot needs to deliver a package to this cell.

The robot has a limited battery capacity and consumes a fixed amount of energy to move from one cell to an adjacent cell (horizontally or vertically - 4-directional movement). It can recharge its battery fully at a charging station. The robot must deliver a single package from a starting location to a designated delivery point within a given deadline (number of moves).

However, the warehouse is dynamic.  Obstacles may appear and disappear over time. You are given a series of timestamps, and for each timestamp, you have a snapshot of the warehouse grid and the remaining moves allowed.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function that determines the optimal path for the robot to deliver the package, considering battery constraints, dynamic obstacles, and the deadline.  The robot *must* reach the delivery point with the package **before** the deadline. The robot can pick up a package only at the starting location and can only deliver the package to the delivery point.

**Input:**

*   `grid_snapshots`: A list of tuples. Each tuple represents a snapshot of the warehouse at a specific time. Each tuple contains:
    *   `grid`: A 2D list of strings representing the warehouse grid. Possible cell values: `"E"` (Empty), `"O"` (Obstacle), `"C"` (Charging Station), `"S"` (Start - package pickup location), `"D"` (Delivery Point).
    *   `remaining_moves`: An integer representing the number of moves remaining until the deadline at this timestamp.
    *   `battery_level`: An integer representing the current battery level of the robot at this timestamp.
*   `battery_capacity`: An integer representing the maximum battery capacity of the robot.
*   `move_cost`: An integer representing the energy consumed per move between adjacent cells.

**Constraints:**

*   The grid dimensions are at most 50x50.
*   The number of snapshots is at most 100.
*   The battery capacity is between 10 and 500.
*   The move cost is between 1 and 10.
*   The remaining moves is between 1 and 500.
*   The grid will always contain exactly one start and one delivery point.
*   The robot starts with the package at the starting location.
*   The robot *must* reach the delivery point with the package **before** the deadline.
*   The robot cannot move to an obstacle cell.
*   The robot can recharge its battery to the full capacity at a charging station. Recharging does not take any moves and can happen at any time the robot is at a charging station.
*   If no path exists to reach the delivery point within the remaining moves and with the battery constraints, return an empty list.
*   You must return the shortest path found.  If multiple shortest paths exist, any one of them is acceptable.

**Output:**

*   A list of tuples representing the optimal path. Each tuple contains the (row, column) coordinates of a cell in the path, in the order visited. The path should start at the starting location and end at the delivery point.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the constraints. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms for pathfinding and battery management.  A naive approach (e.g., brute-force search) will likely time out.
*   The code should be well-structured and readable.

**Example:**

```python
grid_snapshots = [
    (
        [
            ["E", "E", "E", "E"],
            ["O", "O", "E", "E"],
            ["S", "E", "D", "E"],
            ["E", "E", "E", "C"],
        ],
        20,
        50,
    )
]

battery_capacity = 50
move_cost = 5

# One possible optimal path (there might be others of the same length)
# Output: [(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)]
```

This problem requires knowledge of graph algorithms (A\* search or Dijkstra's algorithm), dynamic programming (to potentially optimize for the dynamic obstacles and battery constraints), and efficient data structure usage. It also demands careful handling of edge cases and the ability to reason about time complexity. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging and require a sophisticated solution.

### Project Name

```
Optimal-Evacuation
```

### Question Description

A city is represented as a weighted, undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents a location within the city, and each edge represents a road connecting two locations with an associated traversal time.

A disaster has struck, and the city needs to be evacuated.  A set of *k* evacuation centers are pre-determined locations within the city.  Each location (node) in the city has a population count associated with it.

The goal is to determine the optimal evacuation plan that minimizes the *maximum* evacuation time for any individual in the city. This evacuation time is defined as the time it takes for an individual to travel from their current location to the closest evacuation center.

**Specifically, your task is to write a function that:**

*   Takes as input:
    *   A graph represented as an adjacency list where keys are node IDs (integers), and values are lists of `(neighbor_id, edge_weight)` tuples.
    *   A dictionary of population counts for each location, where keys are node IDs (integers), and values are the population at that location.
    *   A list of node IDs representing the locations of the evacuation centers.

*   Returns:
    *   The minimum possible *maximum* evacuation time across all individuals in the city. This should be an integer.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 10,000 nodes and 100,000 edges).
*   Population counts can be large (up to 1,000,000 per location).
*   Edge weights (traversal times) are positive integers.
*   The number of evacuation centers *k* can vary.
*   You must find a solution that is reasonably efficient. Brute-force approaches will not pass the time limit.
*   Consider the case where some nodes may not be reachable from any evacuation center. In such cases the function should return `-1`.
*   Assume that people can travel simultaneously without affecting road traversal times.
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   The evacuation centers are distinct nodes.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a simple graph:

```
graph = {
    1: [(2, 1), (3, 5)],
    2: [(1, 1), (4, 2)],
    3: [(1, 5), (4, 1)],
    4: [(2, 2), (3, 1)]
}
population = {
    1: 100,
    2: 50,
    3: 75,
    4: 25
}
evacuation_centers = [1, 4]
```

In this case, the function should return the minimum possible *maximum* evacuation time.

**Hints (but still challenging):**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest-path algorithm to compute distances from each location to the nearest evacuation center.
*   Think about how to efficiently search for the minimum *maximum* evacuation time. Binary search might be useful.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   Optimize your code for performance.

This question requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

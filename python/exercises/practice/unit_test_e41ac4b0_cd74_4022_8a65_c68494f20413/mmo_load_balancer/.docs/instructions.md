## Question: Distributed Load Balancing with Dynamic Scaling

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed load balancing system for a massively multiplayer online game (MMO). The game world is divided into multiple zones, each simulated by a separate server instance. Players can move freely between zones. Your system must efficiently distribute players across available server instances, ensuring a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Dynamic Scaling:** The number of server instances available can change dynamically based on overall player load. Your load balancing system should automatically adapt to these changes without service interruption. Server instances can join or leave the cluster at any time.

2.  **Zone Affinity:** Ideally, all players within the same zone should be directed to the same server instance to minimize inter-server communication and latency. However, it's crucial to handle situations where a single zone becomes excessively crowded.

3.  **Load Balancing Metrics:** Your system must consider the following metrics when distributing players:
    *   **CPU Utilization:** Keep CPU usage on each server instance below a critical threshold (e.g., 80%).
    *   **Memory Usage:** Keep memory usage on each server instance below a critical threshold (e.g., 90%).
    *   **Player Count:** Limit the maximum number of players on each server instance.
    *   **Zone Population:** The number of players in a given zone should be as evenly distributed as possible.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to server failures. If a server instance crashes, its players should be automatically redistributed to other available instances.

5.  **Real-time Performance:** The load balancing decisions must be made quickly (sub-second latency) to avoid impacting player experience.

6.  **Scalability:** The system should scale to handle millions of concurrent players and thousands of server instances.

7.  **Weighted Allocation:** Some servers may have different capacity (e.g. due to different hardware). The load balancer must be able to take these server weights into consideration.

**Input:**

The system receives the following information in real-time:

*   A list of available server instances, including their current CPU utilization, memory usage, player count, zone assignments, and server weight.
*   A stream of player connection requests, each specifying the zone the player wants to join.

**Output:**

For each player connection request, your system must determine the optimal server instance to assign the player to, based on the requirements above. The system should output the ID of the assigned server instance.

**Constraints:**

*   You must implement a load balancing algorithm that satisfies the system requirements.
*   You must provide a clear explanation of your algorithm and its trade-offs.
*   Your solution should be optimized for performance and scalability.
*   Consider edge cases such as:
    *   No server instances available.
    *   All server instances are overloaded.
    *   A single zone accounts for a very large amount of traffic.
*   Assume you have access to a reliable distributed data store for storing server instance information and managing state.
*   Assume you have access to efficient inter-process communication mechanism.
*   The algorithm must handle server failures gracefully, ensuring that players are reassigned to other servers if their original server crashes.
*   You must consider the implications of your design on the overall system architecture, including monitoring, logging, and alerting.
*   Implement efficient data structures to minimise lookup/search time.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to detect and mitigate "hot zones" (zones with unusually high player traffic).
*   Implement a predictive load balancing strategy that anticipates future player traffic based on historical data.
*   Provide a simulation of the system in operation, demonstrating its ability to handle dynamic scaling, fault tolerance, and load balancing.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, load balancing algorithms, and real-time performance optimization. Good luck!

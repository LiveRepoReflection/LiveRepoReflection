## Quantum Circuit Optimizer

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing a quantum circuit for execution on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computer. A quantum circuit can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent quantum gates and edges represent qubit dependencies. Each gate has an associated execution time and a fidelity score (probability of correct operation).

Due to limitations of the physical quantum computer, you are given a set of architectural constraints. These constraints are in the form of allowed gate types for each qubit and maximum connectivity between qubits (qubit adjacency graph). Furthermore, certain gates may only be executed if specific other gates have been executed on the same qubit within a defined time window.

Your objective is to find an execution schedule for the quantum circuit that minimizes the total execution time while satisfying all architectural constraints and maximizing the overall circuit fidelity. The overall fidelity is calculated as the product of the fidelities of all gates in the circuit.

**Specifically, you need to implement a function that takes the following inputs:**

*   `circuit_dag`: A dictionary representing the DAG of the quantum circuit. Keys are gate IDs (unique strings), and values are dictionaries with the following keys:
    *   `qubits`: A list of qubit IDs (integers) that the gate operates on.
    *   `gate_type`: A string representing the type of quantum gate (e.g., "H", "CNOT", "RX").
    *   `execution_time`: An integer representing the execution time of the gate.
    *   `fidelity`: A float representing the fidelity of the gate (between 0 and 1).
    *   `dependencies`: A list of gate IDs that must be executed before this gate.
*   `qubit_adjacency_graph`: A dictionary representing the connectivity of the qubits. Keys are qubit IDs (integers), and values are a list of adjacent qubit IDs.
*   `allowed_gates`: A dictionary representing the allowed gate types for each qubit. Keys are qubit IDs (integers), and values are a list of allowed gate types (strings).
*   `gate_dependencies`: A dictionary representing the temporal gate dependency constraints. Keys are gate IDs (strings), and values are a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a gate dependency constraint with two elements: the first is the gate ID that should be executed before, the second is the maximum time window. For instance:

    `gate_dependencies = {"gate_3": [("gate_1", 5), ("gate_2", 10)]}`

    This means that gate `gate_1` should be executed before `gate_3` with a maximum time window of 5. And `gate_2` should be executed before `gate_3` with a maximum time window of 10.

**Your function should return:**

*   A tuple containing:
    *   `schedule`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a scheduled gate and contains the gate ID (string) and the start time (integer). The schedule should be sorted by start time.
    *   `total_execution_time`: The total execution time of the schedule (integer).
    *   `overall_fidelity`: The overall fidelity of the circuit execution (float).

**Constraints:**

*   The input `circuit_dag` will always represent a valid DAG.
*   The `qubit_adjacency_graph` and `allowed_gates` dictionaries will always be consistent.
*   The number of gates in the circuit will be up to 100.
*   The number of qubits will be up to 20.
*   Execution times will be positive integers.
*   Fidelities will be floats between 0 and 1.
*   The goal is to minimize `total_execution_time` while maximizing `overall_fidelity`.
*   Your solution must produce a valid schedule within 10 seconds.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** The returned schedule must be valid (i.e., satisfy all dependencies and architectural constraints).
2.  **Total Execution Time:** Solutions with shorter execution times will be preferred.
3.  **Overall Fidelity:** Among solutions with similar execution times, those with higher overall fidelity will be preferred.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, constraint satisfaction, and optimization techniques. Efficient algorithms and data structures are crucial to achieve a good score within the time limit.

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a wide range of programming skills, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

### Project Name

```
Distributed Key-Value Store with Consistent Hashing and Fault Tolerance
```

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed key-value store. The store should meet the following requirements:

1.  **Consistent Hashing:** Implement consistent hashing to distribute keys across a cluster of `N` servers.  The hash space should be a ring of size `2^32`. Use the MD5 hash function (available in Python's `hashlib` module) to map keys and server IDs to the hash ring.  Each server should be assigned `K` virtual nodes (also known as "replicas") on the ring to improve distribution uniformity. Virtual nodes should be named as "server_id-replica_number".

2.  **Data Storage:** Each server in the cluster stores its assigned key-value pairs in memory (a Python dictionary is sufficient).

3.  **Basic Operations:** Implement the following operations:
    *   `put(key, value)`: Stores the key-value pair on the appropriate server(s) based on consistent hashing.
    *   `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the key from the appropriate server(s). If the key does not exist, return `None`.
    *   `delete(key)`: Deletes the key-value pair from the appropriate server(s).

4.  **Replication and Fault Tolerance:** Implement data replication for fault tolerance.  Each key-value pair should be replicated on `R` servers that are the immediate successors in the hash ring. This means you need to find the `R` virtual nodes with the smallest hash values greater than the key's hash.

5.  **Server Join/Leave:** Implement the ability to add new servers to the cluster (`join(server_id)`) and remove existing servers (`leave(server_id)`).  When a server joins, it should take over its share of the data. When a server leaves, its data should be redistributed to other servers based on the replication factor `R`.  Data migration during join/leave operations should be as efficient as possible.

6.  **Handling Data Inconsistencies:** In a distributed system, temporary inconsistencies can occur. Implement a mechanism to handle potential inconsistencies during `get` operations.  Specifically, when a client requests a value using `get(key)`, it should query all `R` replicas and return the most recently updated value (based on a timestamp associated with each key-value pair).  If the timestamps are the same, return any of the values. If all replicas return `None`, return `None`.
7. **Concurrency:** Assume multiple clients and servers are operating concurrently. Implement appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

**Constraints:**

*   **Number of Servers (N):** 1 to 100
*   **Number of Replicas per Server (K):** 1 to 10
*   **Replication Factor (R):** 1 to N (replication factor should be larger than the number of server, consider as N)
*   **Key Size:** Up to 256 bytes
*   **Value Size:** Up to 1MB
*   **Server IDs:** Unique strings (e.g., "server1", "server2", "server3")
*   **Efficiency:** The `put`, `get`, `delete`, `join`, and `leave` operations should be as efficient as possible, especially considering the need to query multiple replicas and perform data migration.  Avoid full table scans or inefficient data structures.
*   **Scalability:** While this is a simplified implementation, consider the scalability of your design and data structures.

**Implementation Details:**

*   Use Python 3.
*   You can use standard Python libraries (e.g., `hashlib`, `threading`, `time`).
*   Focus on correctness, efficiency, and clarity of your code.
*   Assume a simplified network model where servers can directly communicate with each other (no network failures other than planned server leaves).
*   Do not implement actual network communication. Instead, simulate it using direct function calls between server objects.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the implementation (passes all test cases).
*   Efficiency of the operations (especially during server join/leave).
*   Handling of data inconsistencies.
*   Code clarity and maintainability.
*   Concurrency safety (proper locking).
*   Scalability considerations in the design.

This problem requires a solid understanding of consistent hashing, distributed systems concepts, data replication, concurrency, and efficient data structures. Good luck!

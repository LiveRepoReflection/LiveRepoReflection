## Question: Optimized Social Network Routing

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing algorithm for a massive online social network. The network consists of `N` users, and friendships (bi-directional) exist between some of them. Due to infrastructure limitations, direct message delivery is only possible between friends. However, users can forward messages to their friends, who can then forward to their friends, and so on.

The network is constantly evolving with users joining/leaving, and friendships being created/removed. You need to implement a system that can handle these dynamic changes while efficiently answering the following type of query:

**"Given two user IDs, `A` and `B`, and a maximum forwarding distance `K`, determine the minimum cost path (number of hops) to send a message from A to B, with the constraint that the path length (number of hops) must not exceed `K`. Each hop has a cost of 1.  If no such path exists within the distance `K`, return -1."**

Furthermore, you need to optimize for the following:

1.  **Scalability:** The network can have millions of users and friendships. Your solution must be able to handle large datasets efficiently.
2.  **Dynamic Updates:** The system must efficiently handle a stream of updates to the social network (adding/removing users and friendships).
3.  **Query Performance:** The message routing queries must be answered quickly, even with large `N` and `K`.
4.  **Memory Usage:** Minimize the amount of memory used to represent and maintain the social network.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following operations:

*   `addUser(userID)`: Adds a new user with the given `userID` to the network.
*   `removeUser(userID)`: Removes the user with the given `userID` from the network.  If the user doesn't exist, do nothing. Removing a user also removes all their friendships.
*   `addFriendship(userID1, userID2)`: Creates a friendship between `userID1` and `userID2`.
*   `removeFriendship(userID1, userID2)`: Removes the friendship between `userID1` and `userID2`. If the friendship doesn't exist, do nothing.
*   `getRoute(userID1, userID2, K)`: Returns the minimum cost (number of hops) to send a message from `userID1` to `userID2` with a maximum path length of `K`. Returns -1 if no such route exists.

All `userID`s are integers. There is no guarantee on the order in which operations will be given. You can assume that adding a user with an existing `userID` or adding an existing friendship will have no effect.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10^6` (Maximum number of users)
*   `1 <= userID <= 10^9` (User ID range)
*   `1 <= K <= 100` (Maximum forwarding distance)
*   The number of operations can be up to `10^5`.
*   You need to handle the operations with reasonable time complexity. `getRoute` operations should be significantly faster than rebuilding the whole graph for each query.

Okay, here's a challenging problem description, designed to be solvable, but with substantial complexity and optimization opportunities.

**Project Name:** `NetworkFlowScheduler`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a network flow scheduler for a high-throughput data center. The data center consists of `N` servers (numbered 0 to N-1) and `M` network links (numbered 0 to M-1). Each network link connects two servers and has a finite bandwidth capacity.

You are given a set of `K` data transfer jobs. Each job `k` is defined by:

*   A source server `s_k`
*   A destination server `d_k`
*   A required bandwidth `b_k`
*   A deadline `t_k` (unix timestamp). The job *must* complete its transfer **before** this deadline.
*   A priority `p_k`. Higher value indicates higher priority.

Your goal is to maximize the total priority of completed jobs before their deadlines.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The data center network is represented as an undirected graph where servers are nodes and network links are edges. You will be provided with an adjacency list or edge list describing the network topology and the bandwidth capacity of each link.

2.  **Flow Allocation:** Each data transfer job must be routed from its source server to its destination server. The data flow *must* respect the bandwidth capacity of each network link. Flows can be split across multiple paths.

3.  **Job Completion:** A job is considered "completed" if and only if the *entire* required bandwidth `b_k` has been successfully routed from the source to the destination *before* its deadline `t_k`.

4.  **Resource Contention:** Multiple jobs may compete for the same network links. If the total bandwidth demand on a link exceeds its capacity, you must determine which jobs to prioritize, considering their priorities and deadlines.

5.  **Dynamic Scheduling:** The scheduler operates in discrete time steps. At each time step, you must re-evaluate the existing flow allocations and potentially re-route jobs to maximize the overall completed priority. You can assume that re-routing a job takes a negligible amount of time.

6.  **Bandwidth Units:** Assume bandwidth is measured in abstract units (e.g., Gbps).

7.  **Server Capacity:** Assume each server can handle any bandwidth amount for sending and receiving.

**Input:**

You will be given the following information:

*   `N`: The number of servers.
*   `M`: The number of network links.
*   `links`: A list of tuples `(u, v, capacity)`, where `u` and `v` are the server IDs connected by the link, and `capacity` is the bandwidth capacity of the link.
*   `K`: The number of data transfer jobs.
*   `jobs`: A list of tuples `(s, d, b, t, p)`, where `s` is the source server, `d` is the destination server, `b` is the required bandwidth, `t` is the deadline (unix timestamp), and `p` is the priority.
*   `current_time`: The current time (unix timestamp). This will increment in the test cases.

**Output:**

A list of job IDs (0-indexed) that are completed *before* their deadlines, sorted in ascending order.
*   Jobs that are not completed before their deadline should not be in the output.
*   Jobs should be completed in order to maximize the total priority.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the total priority of completed jobs across a series of test cases with varying network topologies, job characteristics (bandwidth, deadlines, priorities), and time windows.  Efficiency and correctness will be equally important. Suboptimal solutions that complete fewer high-priority jobs will receive lower scores. The tests will consider large datasets.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   **Efficient Pathfinding:** Finding suitable paths between source and destination servers is crucial. Consider using algorithms like Dijkstra's or A\* search, or Ford-Fulkerson with appropriate optimizations.
*   **Flow Optimization:** Max-flow min-cut algorithms can be used to determine the maximum achievable bandwidth between two servers.
*   **Deadline-Aware Scheduling:** Prioritize jobs with earlier deadlines to avoid missing them.
*   **Priority-Based Allocation:** Higher-priority jobs should be given precedence when allocating bandwidth.
*   **Heuristic Approaches:** In some cases, finding the absolute optimal solution may be computationally infeasible. Consider using heuristics or approximation algorithms to find near-optimal solutions within the given time constraints.

This problem requires you to integrate knowledge of graph algorithms, network flow concepts, and scheduling techniques to design a robust and efficient network flow scheduler.  Good luck!

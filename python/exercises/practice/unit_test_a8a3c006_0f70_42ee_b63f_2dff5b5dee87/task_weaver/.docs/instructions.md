Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a programmer's proficiency with data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques, aiming for LeetCode Hard difficulty:

## Question: Distributed Task Scheduler with Dependencies and Resource Constraints

**Description:**

You are designing a distributed task scheduler for a large-scale data processing pipeline. The pipeline consists of a set of tasks that need to be executed in a specific order, respecting dependencies between them. Each task also requires a certain amount of resources (CPU and Memory) to run. The scheduler needs to efficiently assign these tasks to a cluster of machines with varying resource capacities, minimizing the overall completion time (makespan).

**Input:**

*   **Tasks:** A list of tasks, where each task is represented by a dictionary/object with the following attributes:
    *   `task_id`: A unique identifier for the task (string).
    *   `dependencies`: A list of `task_id`s that must be completed before this task can start (list of strings).  An empty list indicates no dependencies.
    *   `cpu_requirement`: The number of CPU cores required to run this task (integer).
    *   `memory_requirement`: The amount of memory (in GB) required to run this task (integer).
    *   `execution_time`: The estimated execution time of the task (in seconds) (integer).
*   **Machines:** A list of machines, where each machine is represented by a dictionary/object with the following attributes:
    *   `machine_id`: A unique identifier for the machine (string).
    *   `cpu_capacity`: The total number of CPU cores available on this machine (integer).
    *   `memory_capacity`: The total amount of memory (in GB) available on this machine (integer).
*   **`parallelism_limit`**: The maximum number of tasks that can run in parallel across the *entire cluster* at any given time. (integer).

**Output:**

A schedule that maps each task to a machine and a start time. The schedule should be represented as a dictionary/object with the following structure:

```
{
  "task_id_1": {
    "machine_id": "machine_id_x",
    "start_time": 10  // in seconds
  },
  "task_id_2": {
    "machine_id": "machine_id_y",
    "start_time": 15
  },
  ...
}
```

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Dependency Constraint:** A task can only start executing after all its dependencies have been completed.
2.  **Resource Constraint:** A task can only be assigned to a machine if the machine has sufficient CPU and memory capacity at the task's scheduled start time.
3.  **Non-Preemption:** Once a task starts running on a machine, it runs to completion without interruption (no preemption).
4.  **Parallelism Limit:**  The total number of tasks running simultaneously across all machines must never exceed `parallelism_limit`.
5.  **Makespan Minimization:** The schedule should minimize the makespan, which is the time when the last task completes.
6.  **Cycles:** The input task dependencies must not contain any cycles. If cycles exist, the scheduler cannot produce a valid schedule and must raise an exception or return an error message.
7.  **Scalability:** The number of tasks and machines can be large (e.g., thousands).  The solution should be efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
8.  **Real-world Considerations:** Tasks do not share resources. The scheduler should prioritize resource utilization and minimize machine idle time.

**Example:**

```python
tasks = [
    {"task_id": "A", "dependencies": [], "cpu_requirement": 2, "memory_requirement": 4, "execution_time": 10},
    {"task_id": "B", "dependencies": ["A"], "cpu_requirement": 1, "memory_requirement": 2, "execution_time": 5},
    {"task_id": "C", "dependencies": ["A"], "cpu_requirement": 3, "memory_requirement": 6, "execution_time": 8},
    {"task_id": "D", "dependencies": ["B", "C"], "cpu_requirement": 2, "memory_requirement": 4, "execution_time": 7},
]

machines = [
    {"machine_id": "M1", "cpu_capacity": 4, "memory_capacity": 8},
    {"machine_id": "M2", "cpu_capacity": 3, "memory_capacity": 6},
]

parallelism_limit = 3
```

**Possible Solution Approaches:**

*   **Topological Sorting:** Use topological sorting to determine the order in which tasks can be executed based on dependencies.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Implement a resource allocation strategy to assign tasks to machines, considering CPU and memory requirements.  Consider heuristics like First-Fit, Best-Fit, or Worst-Fit.
*   **Scheduling Algorithm:**  Employ a scheduling algorithm like list scheduling or a greedy approach to determine the start time of each task, respecting dependencies and resource constraints.
*   **Optimization:**  Explore optimization techniques such as branch and bound or simulated annealing to improve the makespan. Be aware of the complexity overhead.
*   **Data Structures:**  Use appropriate data structures (e.g., priority queues, graphs) to efficiently manage tasks, dependencies, and machine resources.

**Scoring:**

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:**  The schedule must satisfy all the constraints (dependency, resource, parallelism).
*   **Makespan:** The lower the makespan, the better.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be able to handle large inputs in a reasonable time.
*   **Code Quality:**  The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, data structure expertise, and optimization skills. Good luck!

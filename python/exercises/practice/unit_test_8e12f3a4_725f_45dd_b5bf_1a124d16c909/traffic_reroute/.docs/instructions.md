Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Python problem designed to test a variety of skills.

**Problem Title:** Optimal Traffic Flow Re-routing

**Problem Description:**

A major metropolitan area is experiencing severe traffic congestion. The city's transportation authority has tasked you with developing a system to dynamically re-route traffic in real-time to minimize the overall commute time for all drivers.

You are given a road network represented as a directed graph.  Each node in the graph represents an intersection, and each directed edge represents a road segment connecting two intersections. Each road segment has a capacity (maximum number of vehicles it can handle per minute) and a current traffic flow (number of vehicles currently using the road segment per minute).

You also have a list of origin-destination pairs, representing the typical routes drivers want to take.  Each pair is associated with a demand â€“ the number of drivers that want to travel from the origin to the destination per minute.

Your task is to design an algorithm that, given the current state of the road network (graph, capacities, flows) and the origin-destination demands, determines the optimal re-routing strategy to minimize the total weighted commute time.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The graph can be large, potentially containing thousands of nodes and edges.  The graph structure and initial traffic conditions are provided as input.

2.  **Real-time Updates:** The system needs to react quickly to changes in traffic flow. Your algorithm must be efficient enough to produce new routing recommendations within a reasonable time frame (e.g., a few seconds).

3.  **Capacity Constraints:**  The traffic flow on any road segment *cannot* exceed its capacity.  Your routing must respect these constraints. If demand exceeds capacity, provide the best possible solution, routing as much traffic as possible according to demand constraints, but respecting capacity limits.

4.  **Weighted Commute Time:** Minimize the total weighted commute time, calculated as the sum of (flow * travel time) for each road segment, summed over all segments in the network. Assume that travel time on a road segment is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity on that segment. Specifically, let `capacity` be the road segment's capacity, and `flow` be the current flow on that segment. Then the travel time can be defined as `1 / (capacity - flow + 1)`. This means that when flow equals capacity, travel time becomes very high, discouraging further use of that segment.

5.  **Origin-Destination Demands:** You must satisfy as much of the origin-destination demand as possible. If demand cannot be fully satisfied due to capacity constraints, you should prioritize satisfying demand proportionally to the original demand values (e.g., if OD pair A has twice the demand of OD pair B, you should try to satisfy twice as much of A's demand as B's).

6.  **Cycle Detection and Avoidance:** The re-routing algorithm should avoid creating traffic cycles in the network, as these can lead to instability.

7.  **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If there are multiple optimal solutions, any one of them is acceptable.

8.  **Large Input Handling:** The input data (graph size, number of origin-destination pairs, demands) can be quite large. Efficient memory management and algorithm implementation are crucial.

9.  **Output Format:** The output should specify the adjusted traffic flow for each road segment in the network.

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided in a JSON format. The JSON object will contain the following keys:

*   `nodes`: A list of node IDs (integers).
*   `edges`: A list of edges, where each edge is a dictionary with the following keys:
    *   `source`: Source node ID (integer).
    *   `destination`: Destination node ID (integer).
    *   `capacity`: Road segment capacity (integer).
    *   `flow`: Current traffic flow (integer).
*   `demands`: A list of origin-destination demands, where each demand is a dictionary with the following keys:
    *   `origin`: Origin node ID (integer).
    *   `destination`: Destination node ID (integer).
    *   `demand`: Number of vehicles per minute wanting to travel from origin to destination (integer).

**Output Format:**

The output should be a JSON object with a single key `edges`, which is a list of edges. Each edge should be a dictionary with the following keys:

*   `source`: Source node ID (integer).
*   `destination`: Destination node ID (integer).
*   `flow`: The adjusted traffic flow for this road segment (integer).

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The output must be a valid re-routing that satisfies all constraints (capacity, demand proportionality, cycle avoidance).
*   **Optimality:** The solution should minimize the total weighted commute time.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm must run within a reasonable time limit.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be able to handle large input graphs and demand sets.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, maximum flow), optimization techniques (e.g., linear programming, heuristics), and careful consideration of data structures and performance. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem description suitable for a programming competition, focusing on graph traversal and optimization.

## Question: Minimum Cost Island Network

### Question Description

The nation of Islandia consists of *N* islands, numbered from 1 to *N*. Due to historical reasons and the unique geological landscape, there are no bridges or tunnels connecting these islands. To improve trade and communication, the Islandian government has decided to build a network of bidirectional underwater tunnels.

Each tunnel can be built between any two distinct islands *i* and *j* at a cost of *C<sub>ij</sub>*. Building a tunnel directly between islands *i* and *j* takes time *T<sub>ij</sub>*.

The government has two primary goals:

1.  **Connectivity:** Ensure that any two islands can reach each other through a sequence of tunnels. In other words, the tunnel network must form a single connected component.
2.  **Budget Constraint:** The total cost of building all tunnels must not exceed a given budget *B*.

However, the project managers have realized that minimizing the *total construction time* is also crucial. They need to find a tunnel network that connects all islands, stays within the budget, and minimizes the total construction time.

You are given the number of islands *N*, the budget *B*, and two matrices, *C* and *T*, where *C<sub>ij</sub>* represents the cost of building a tunnel between island *i* and island *j*, and *T<sub>ij</sub>* represents the time it takes to build that tunnel. Note that *C<sub>ij</sub>* = *C<sub>ji</sub>* and *T<sub>ij</sub>* = *T<sub>ji</sub>*. Also, *C<sub>ii</sub>* = *T<sub>ii</sub>* = 0 for all *i*. If there's no possible tunnel between island *i* and island *j*, *C<sub>ij</sub>* and *T<sub>ij</sub>* is -1.

**Your task is to write a function that determines the minimum total construction time required to connect all islands within the given budget. If it is impossible to connect all islands within the budget, return -1.**

**Constraints:**

*   2 <= N <= 30
*   1 <= B <= 10<sup>6</sup>
*   0 <= C<sub>ij</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   0 <= T<sub>ij</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   *C<sub>ij</sub>* = *C<sub>ji</sub>* and *T<sub>ij</sub>* = *T<sub>ji</sub>*. *C<sub>ii</sub>* = *T<sub>ii</sub>* = 0
*   If there's no possible tunnel between island *i* and island *j*, *C<sub>ij</sub>* and *T<sub>ij</sub>* is -1.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of islands.
*   `B`: The budget.
*   `C`: A 2D array representing the cost matrix. `C[i][j]` is the cost of building a tunnel between island `i+1` and island `j+1`.
*   `T`: A 2D array representing the time matrix. `T[i][j]` is the time it takes to build a tunnel between island `i+1` and island `j+1`.

**Output:**

*   The minimum total construction time required to connect all islands within the given budget, or -1 if it is impossible.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
B = 100
C = [[0, 20, 30, 40],
     [20, 0, 30, 30],
     [30, 30, 0, 20],
     [40, 30, 20, 0]]
T = [[0, 5, 7, 9],
     [5, 0, 6, 6],
     [7, 6, 0, 4],
     [9, 6, 4, 0]]

Output: 15

Explanation:
One possible solution is to build tunnels between:
- Island 1 and Island 2 (Cost: 20, Time: 5)
- Island 3 and Island 4 (Cost: 20, Time: 4)
- Island 2 and Island 3 (Cost: 30, Time: 6)

Total Cost: 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 <= 100
Total Time: 5 + 4 + 6 = 15

Another possible solution with less time to build :
- Island 1 and Island 2 (Cost: 20, Time: 5)
- Island 2 and Island 4 (Cost: 30, Time: 6)
- Island 3 and Island 4 (Cost: 20, Time: 4)

Total Cost: 20 + 30 + 20 = 70 <= 100
Total Time: 5 + 6 + 4 = 15
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal to check for connectivity, intelligent search to explore different tunnel combinations, and optimization to minimize the total construction time within the budget. Good luck!

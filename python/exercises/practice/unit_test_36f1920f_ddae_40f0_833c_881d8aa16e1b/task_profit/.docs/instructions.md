Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

## Project Name

`OptimalTaskScheduler`

## Question Description

You are given a list of `n` tasks, each with a deadline and a profit. Each task takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete. You have a single processor and can execute tasks in any order.

Your goal is to maximize the total profit you can earn by completing tasks before their deadlines.

**Input:**

*   A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a task: `tasks = [(deadline1, profit1), (deadline2, profit2), ..., (deadlinen, profitn)]`.  The deadline is a positive integer representing the latest time unit by which the task must be completed to earn the profit. The profit is a non-negative integer.

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the maximum total profit that can be earned.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5` (number of tasks)
*   `1 <= deadlinei <= n` for all tasks (deadlines are between 1 and the total number of tasks, inclusive)
*   `0 <= profiti <= 10^9` for all tasks (profits can be large)

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should have a time complexity significantly better than O(n^2). Solutions with O(n log n) time complexity or better are desired.
*   Minimize memory usage.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Empty list of tasks.
*   Tasks with the same deadline.
*   Tasks with very high profits compared to others.
*   Tasks where all deadlines are the same.
*   Tasks where some profits are zero

**Real-world Practical Scenarios:**

This problem models resource allocation and scheduling in various scenarios, such as:

*   Job scheduling on a single processor.
*   Optimizing advertising campaign placement within given time constraints.
*   Prioritizing projects with varying deadlines and ROI.

**System Design Aspects (Implicit):**

While not explicitly a system design question, consider how your solution could be adapted to handle a larger number of tasks or a stream of incoming tasks. Could you use a priority queue to efficiently manage tasks based on their potential profit and deadlines? Think about the scalability and maintainability of your solution.

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

The key to solving this problem efficiently is to prioritize tasks with higher profits while respecting their deadlines. A greedy approach, combined with an appropriate data structure, is crucial for achieving optimal performance.

**Multiple Valid Approaches with Different Trade-offs:**

Several approaches are possible, including:

1.  **Greedy with Sorting and a Disjoint Set Union-Find:** Sort tasks by profit in descending order. Use a Disjoint Set Union-Find data structure to efficiently find available slots before each task's deadline. This is generally the most efficient approach.

2.  **Greedy with Sorting and a Boolean Array:** Sort tasks by profit in descending order. Maintain a boolean array indicating whether a time slot is occupied.  For each task, iterate backward from its deadline to find an available slot. This is less efficient than using Union-Find, especially when many slots are occupied.

3.  **Dynamic Programming (Less Efficient):** While DP can solve it, it's less efficient due to memory and time complexity. It's generally not suitable given the constraints.

The challenge lies in implementing the chosen approach efficiently and correctly, handling edge cases, and optimizing for both time and memory. Good luck!

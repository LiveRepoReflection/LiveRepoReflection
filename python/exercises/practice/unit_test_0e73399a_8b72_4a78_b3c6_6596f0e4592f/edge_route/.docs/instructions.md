Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations.

**Problem Title:  Optimal Multi-Hop Route Planning for Edge Computing Tasks**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a distributed edge computing platform.  This platform consists of a network of edge servers (nodes) interconnected via communication links.  Each node has limited computational resources (CPU, Memory) and a geographical location.

A user submits a computational task to the platform.  The task can be divided into smaller, sequential subtasks (stages).  Each stage requires specific computational resources and can only be executed on a subset of the available edge servers (due to software dependencies, hardware capabilities, or data locality requirements).

The network between edge servers has latency (delay) associated with each link. The task also has a deadline (maximum allowed execution time).  The goal is to find an optimal route for the task's execution, minimizing the end-to-end latency while meeting all resource requirements and the deadline.

**More formally:**

*   You are given a directed graph representing the edge computing network. Nodes represent edge servers, and edges represent communication links.
*   Each node `i` has `CPU_i` and `Memory_i` representing available CPU and Memory resources.
*   Each edge `(u, v)` has `Latency_(u,v)` representing the communication latency between nodes `u` and `v`.
*   The task consists of `N` sequential stages.
*   Each stage `j` has `CPU_j` and `Memory_j` representing the required CPU and Memory resources.
*   For each stage `j`, you are given a list `Eligible_Nodes_j` of nodes that can execute that stage.
*   The task has a deadline `D`.
*   The execution time of each stage on a node is negligible compared to the communication latency.  Therefore, only communication latencies need to be considered.

**Your Task:**

Write a function that takes the graph, node resources, link latencies, task stages requirements, eligible nodes per stage, and task deadline as input.  The function should return a list of nodes representing the optimal route for executing the task.  If no feasible route exists that meets all constraints and the deadline, return an empty list `[]`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Resource Constraints:** Each stage `j` must be executed on a node in `Eligible_Nodes_j` that has sufficient `CPU` and `Memory` resources available.  The available resources are *not* replenished after a stage completes (consider them consumed for the duration of the task).
2.  **Sequential Execution:**  Stages must be executed in the given order (1 to N).
3.  **Deadline Constraint:** The total latency along the chosen route must be less than or equal to the deadline `D`.
4.  **Optimization Goal:** Among all feasible routes that satisfy the above constraints, find the route with the *minimum* total latency.
5.  **Large Scale:** The graph can contain up to 1000 nodes and 10000 edges. The number of stages can be up to 10.
6.  **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient and should avoid brute-force enumeration of all possible routes, which would be computationally infeasible for large graphs. Consider algorithmic optimization techniques such as dynamic programming or informed search algorithms.
7.  **Tie-breaking:** If multiple routes have the same minimum latency, return any one of them.

**Input Format (Python):**

```python
def find_optimal_route(graph, node_resources, link_latencies, stage_requirements, eligible_nodes, deadline):
    """
    Finds the optimal route for executing a task on a distributed edge computing platform.

    Args:
        graph: A dictionary representing the directed graph. Keys are node IDs, and values are lists of neighboring node IDs. E.g., {1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: [4]}
        node_resources: A dictionary representing the available resources for each node. Keys are node IDs, and values are tuples (CPU, Memory). E.g., {1: (10, 20), 2: (15, 25), 3: (8, 15), 4: (12, 18)}
        link_latencies: A dictionary representing the communication latency between nodes. Keys are tuples (node1, node2), and values are the latency. E.g., {(1, 2): 5, (1, 3): 3, (2, 4): 2, (3, 4): 4}
        stage_requirements: A list of tuples representing the resource requirements for each stage.  Each tuple is (CPU, Memory). E.g., [(3, 5), (2, 4), (4, 6)]
        eligible_nodes: A list of lists representing the eligible nodes for each stage. E.g., [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
        deadline: The maximum allowed execution time (total latency).

    Returns:
        A list of node IDs representing the optimal route, or an empty list if no feasible route exists.
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

**Example:**

```python
graph = {1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: [4]}
node_resources = {1: (10, 20), 2: (15, 25), 3: (8, 15), 4: (12, 18)}
link_latencies = {(1, 2): 5, (1, 3): 3, (2, 4): 2, (3, 4): 4}
stage_requirements = [(3, 5), (2, 4), (4, 6)]
eligible_nodes = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
deadline = 12

#Expected output (one possible solution): [1, 2, 4]
#Total latency: 5 + 2 = 7 <= 12
```

This problem requires careful consideration of graph algorithms, resource management, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

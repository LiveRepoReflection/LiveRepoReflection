Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed with the requested elements:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Ordering Service

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a distributed transaction ordering service. This service receives transaction requests from various clients, each targeting a specific resource.  The goal is to serialize access to each resource, ensuring that transactions affecting the same resource are processed in a consistent, globally ordered manner, even when originating from different clients and servers.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Input:** Each transaction is represented as a tuple: `(client_id, transaction_id, resource_id, operation)`.
    *   `client_id`: A unique identifier for the client originating the transaction (string).
    *   `transaction_id`: A unique identifier for the transaction within the client (string).  Combined with `client_id`, this forms a globally unique transaction identifier.
    *   `resource_id`: A unique identifier for the resource being accessed (string).
    *   `operation`: A string describing the operation (e.g., "read", "write"). The content of this string does not matter.

2.  **Ordering Guarantee:** For any given `resource_id`, transactions affecting that resource must be processed in the order they were *submitted* to your service. "Submitted" implies the order in which they are received by the service. This is a critical correctness requirement.

3.  **Distributed Environment:** Your solution must function in a simulated distributed environment.  Assume that transactions arrive at your service through a message queue (you do not need to implement the queue; it's simulated by input).  Transactions may arrive out of order relative to their `transaction_id` *from the same client*, but the service must still guarantee total order by submission time to the service.

4.  **Concurrency:** The service must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent transaction requests.  Optimize for throughput.

5.  **Scalability:** The service should be designed with scalability in mind. Consider how you would shard the processing of transactions across multiple nodes based on `resource_id`. (While you don't need to *fully* implement sharding, your architecture should demonstrate awareness of how it would work).

6.  **Fault Tolerance:**  Explain how you would handle node failures.  A full implementation is not required, but a description of your approach is.

7.  **Resource Contention:**  The service must handle situations where multiple transactions are waiting for access to the same resource.  Avoid starvation.

8. **Memory constraints:** The service must be able to handle large number of transaction requests. Therefore, keep a small footprint of memory.

9. **Output**: The service must provide a method to retrieve the ordered list of transactions for a specific `resource_id`.

**Input:**

The input will be a list of transaction tuples, representing the order in which they are received by the service.

**Example Input:**

```python
transactions = [
    ("client1", "tx1", "resourceA", "write"),
    ("client2", "tx1", "resourceB", "read"),
    ("client1", "tx2", "resourceA", "read"),
    ("client3", "tx1", "resourceA", "write"),
    ("client2", "tx2", "resourceB", "write"),
]
```

**Expected Output (for `get_ordered_transactions("resourceA")`):**

```python
[
    ("client1", "tx1", "resourceA", "write"),
    ("client1", "tx2", "resourceA", "read"),
    ("client3", "tx1", "resourceA", "write"),
]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of transactions can be very large (up to 1 million).
*   The number of unique resources can be large (up to 10,000).
*   Minimize latency for transaction processing.
*   Minimize memory usage.
*   Your solution *must* be thread-safe.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the service guarantee the correct ordering of transactions for each resource?
*   **Performance:** How quickly can the service process transactions?
*   **Scalability:** How well does the solution scale as the number of transactions and resources increases?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Concurrency Handling:** Is the code thread-safe and does it handle concurrency effectively?
*   **Memory Efficiency:** How well does the solution minimize memory usage?

This problem requires a deep understanding of concurrency, distributed systems concepts, and efficient data structures. Good luck!

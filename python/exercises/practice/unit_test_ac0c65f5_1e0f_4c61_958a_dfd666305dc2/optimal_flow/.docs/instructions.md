Okay, here is a challenging Python coding problem designed with the requested complexity and considerations.

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkFlow`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal network flow algorithm for a dynamic communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, each representing a server, and `M` directed edges representing communication links between them. Each edge has a maximum capacity, indicating the maximum data flow rate it can support.

The network is dynamic, meaning that both the capacities of the edges and the availability of nodes can change over time. Your algorithm must efficiently handle these changes and determine the maximum possible data flow from a designated source node `S` to a designated sink node `T` at any given time.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Node Availability:** Each node has an "online" and "offline" status. Data can only flow through nodes that are currently online. If a node is offline, all its incoming and outgoing edges are effectively disabled.

2.  **Capacity Fluctuations:** The capacity of each edge can change. Your algorithm needs to adapt to these changes quickly without recomputing the entire flow from scratch.

3.  **Real-Time Queries:** You will receive a series of queries. Each query can be one of the following types:

    *   `UpdateNode(node_id, status)`: Updates the online/offline status of a specific node. `status` is a boolean (True for online, False for offline).
    *   `UpdateCapacity(start_node, end_node, capacity)`: Updates the capacity of the edge from `start_node` to `end_node`.
    *   `QueryFlow()`: Returns the maximum possible data flow from the source node `S` to the sink node `T` considering the current node availability and edge capacities.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 1000 (Number of Nodes)
*   1 <= `M` <= 5000 (Number of Edges)
*   Node IDs are integers from 1 to `N`.
*   Source node `S` and Sink node `T` are always online and distinct.
*   Edge capacities are non-negative integers.
*   Number of queries can be up to 10000.
*   Your algorithm must be efficient enough to handle all queries within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Inefficient algorithms that recalculate the entire flow for each query will likely time out.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   `N`, `M`, `S`, `T`: Number of nodes, number of edges, source node ID, and sink node ID.
*   A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple represents an edge: `(start_node, end_node, initial_capacity)`.
*   A list of initial node statuses: A list of booleans of length N, where the i-th element indicates whether node i is online(True) or offline(False)
*   A list of queries, where each query is one of the following:
    *   `("UpdateNode", node_id, status)`
    *   `("UpdateCapacity", start_node, end_node, capacity)`
    *   `("QueryFlow",)`

**Output:**

For each `QueryFlow` query, your algorithm should output the maximum flow from `S` to `T`.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:** The maximum flow calculated must be correct for each query.
*   **Efficiency:** Your algorithm must be able to handle a large number of queries within a reasonable time limit. Algorithms with high time complexity will likely fail.
*   **Memory Usage:**  Keep memory usage reasonable.

**Hints and Considerations:**

*   Consider using an efficient data structure to represent the network and its flow.
*   Explore algorithms that can efficiently update the maximum flow after small changes in the network (e.g., incremental flow algorithms).  Ford-Fulkerson while sufficient, may not be efficient enough with frequent updates.  Consider algorithms that offer better performance characteristics.
*   Think about how to represent node availability in your flow calculations efficiently.
*   Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as disconnected networks or zero capacities.
*   Pre-processing the graph might be useful to improve query performance.

This problem requires a good understanding of network flow algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focused on Python.

**Problem Title: Optimal Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Routing**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a fleet of autonomous vehicles operating in a dynamic urban environment. The goal is to minimize the average delivery time of packages, subject to a variety of real-world constraints and optimization considerations.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following:

1.  **`N`:** The number of vehicles in the fleet (1 <= N <= 100).
2.  **`M`:** The number of delivery requests (1 <= M <= 10,000).
3.  **`graph`:** A directed graph representing the road network. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each key is a node (intersection) ID (integer), and the value is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the destination node ID (integer) and the travel time (integer) between the origin and destination nodes. Assume travel times are non-negative.
4.  **`vehicle_start_locations`:** A list of `N` node IDs representing the starting locations of each vehicle.
5.  **`delivery_requests`:** A list of `M` delivery requests. Each request is represented as a tuple `(pickup_node, dropoff_node, package_size, time_window_start, time_window_end)`.
    *   `pickup_node`: The node ID where the package needs to be picked up.
    *   `dropoff_node`: The node ID where the package needs to be delivered.
    *   `package_size`: An integer representing the size of the package.
    *   `time_window_start`: The earliest time the package can be picked up.
    *   `time_window_end`: The latest time the package can be dropped off (deadline).
6.  **`vehicle_capacity`:** An integer representing the maximum package size a vehicle can carry.
7.  **`charging_stations`:** A list of node IDs representing the locations of charging stations.
8.  **`vehicle_battery_capacity`:** Integer representing the battery capacity of each vehicle (in time units)
9.  **`battery_consumption_rate`:** Integer representing the battery consumption rate per time unit. Each vehicle must be able to reach a charging station before its battery is fully depleted.
10. **`charging_time_per_unit`:** Integer representing the time it takes to charge one unit of battery at a charging station.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Time Windows:** Each delivery must be picked up no earlier than `time_window_start` and dropped off no later than `time_window_end`.
2.  **Vehicle Capacity:** The total size of packages in a vehicle at any given time cannot exceed `vehicle_capacity`.
3.  **Battery Life:** Each vehicle must have sufficient battery to complete its route and must be able to reach a charging station before its battery is fully depleted.
4.  **Valid Routes:** Vehicles must only travel along the edges specified in the graph.
5.  **Start Location:** Each vehicle must start from its designated `vehicle_start_locations`.
6.  **Non-preemptive Pickups**: Each vehicle must deliver the package it picks up.
7.  **Charging Policy**: Vehicle can charge at any charging station node. Charging can be partial or complete.
8.  **Multiple vehicles can be at the same node at the same time.**
9.  **1 <= pickup_node, dropoff_node <= Number of nodes in the graph**
10. **1 <= package_size <= vehicle_capacity**
11. **0 <= time_window_start <= time_window_end <= Maximum possible time**
12. **It's guaranteed that there is a path between all the nodes**

**Output:**

A list of routes, one for each vehicle. Each route is a list of tuples `(node_id, time, action, package_id)`.

*   `node_id`: The node ID where the vehicle is located.
*   `time`: The time the vehicle arrives at the node.
*   `action`: A string, which can be one of the following: `"idle"`, `"pickup"`, `"dropoff"`, `"charge"`
*   `package_id`: The ID of the package being picked up or dropped off.  If the action is `"idle"` or `"charge"`, `package_id` should be `-1`. Package IDs are assigned sequentially from 0 to `M-1`.

**Scoring:**

The score is the average delivery time of all packages. The delivery time for a package is the difference between the drop-off time and the pickup time. The goal is to minimize the average delivery time. If any constraint is violated, the score is negative infinity.

**Example:**

Let's say you have two packages. Package 1 is picked up at time 5 and delivered at time 10. Package 2 is picked up at time 7 and delivered at time 12.
The average delivery time is ((10 - 5) + (12 - 7)) / 2 = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5.

**Python Function Signature:**

```python
def solve(N, M, graph, vehicle_start_locations, delivery_requests, vehicle_capacity, charging_stations, vehicle_battery_capacity, battery_consumption_rate, charging_time_per_unit):
    """
    Solves the optimal autonomous vehicle fleet routing problem.

    Args:
        N: The number of vehicles.
        M: The number of delivery requests.
        graph: The road network as an adjacency list.
        vehicle_start_locations: A list of starting locations for each vehicle.
        delivery_requests: A list of delivery requests.
        vehicle_capacity: The maximum package size a vehicle can carry.
        charging_stations: A list of node IDs representing the locations of charging stations.
        vehicle_battery_capacity: Integer representing the battery capacity of each vehicle (in time units)
        battery_consumption_rate: Integer representing the battery consumption rate per time unit.
        charging_time_per_unit: Integer representing the time it takes to charge one unit of battery at a charging station.

    Returns:
        A list of routes, one for each vehicle.
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must adhere to all the specified constraints.
*   **Optimality:** The solution should minimize the average delivery time.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be computationally efficient, especially for large input sizes. Time limit will be strictly enforced.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search to find the shortest paths.
*   Explore different routing algorithms, such as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, or constraint programming.
*   Think about how to handle time windows and vehicle capacity constraints efficiently.
*   Consider using heuristics and approximations to improve performance.
*   Implement a mechanism to check the battery life.
*   Think carefully about data structures to represent the state of each vehicle and the overall system.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, optimization techniques, and careful implementation. Good luck!

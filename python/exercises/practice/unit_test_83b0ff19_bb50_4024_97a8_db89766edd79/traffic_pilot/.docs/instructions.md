Okay, I'm ready to design a challenging Python problem. Here it is:

## Project Name

`AutonomousTrafficManagement`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a core component of an autonomous traffic management system for a city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are intersections and edges are road segments connecting them. Each road segment has a capacity (maximum number of vehicles it can hold) and a travel time (time it takes to traverse the segment).

A set of vehicles needs to be routed from their respective origins to destinations within the city. Each vehicle has a starting time, origin intersection, destination intersection and a size representing the space it occupies on the road.

Your task is to implement a function that computes an *optimal* traffic flow allocation given the current state of the road network and the vehicles that need to be routed. Optimal here means minimizing the *average travel time* of all vehicles while adhering to road capacities and avoiding congestion.

**Specifically, you must:**

1.  **Represent the city as a graph:** You need to design a suitable data structure to represent the city's road network including intersections, road segments, capacities, and travel times.

2.  **Implement a routing algorithm:** Implement an algorithm to find paths for each vehicle from its origin to its destination. This algorithm *must* consider both travel time and road capacity. A simple shortest-path algorithm is insufficient due to capacity constraints. You must handle situations where a direct path is congested and explore alternative routes.

3.  **Handle Traffic Congestion:** Model and simulate the dynamic nature of traffic. As vehicles are routed, update the utilization of each road segment. Implement a mechanism to detect and avoid congestion. This may involve re-routing vehicles dynamically.

4.  **Optimize for Average Travel Time:** The primary objective is to minimize the average travel time of all vehicles. You need to carefully consider how your routing algorithm and congestion avoidance mechanism contribute to this goal.

5.  **Consider Vehicle Sizes:** Factor in the impact of vehicle sizes on road capacity. Larger vehicles consume more road space, effectively reducing the available capacity for other vehicles.

**Input:**

*   A dictionary representing the city graph. The keys are intersection IDs (integers). The values are dictionaries containing information about outgoing road segments. Each road segment dictionary has the following format:

    ```python
    {
        destination_intersection_id: {
            'capacity': integer,
            'travel_time': integer
        }
    }
    ```

    Example:

    ```python
    city_graph = {
        0: {1: {'capacity': 100, 'travel_time': 10}},
        1: {2: {'capacity': 80, 'travel_time': 15}, 0: {'capacity': 50, 'travel_time': 12}},
        2: {0: {'capacity': 60, 'travel_time': 20}}
    }
    ```

*   A list of vehicle dictionaries. Each vehicle dictionary has the following format:

    ```python
    {
        'start_time': integer,
        'origin': integer,
        'destination': integer,
        'size': integer
    }
    ```

    Example:

    ```python
    vehicles = [
        {'start_time': 0, 'origin': 0, 'destination': 2, 'size': 5},
        {'start_time': 5, 'origin': 1, 'destination': 0, 'size': 10}
    ]
    ```

*   `simulation_time`: An integer representing the total simulation time.

**Output:**

*   A dictionary containing the average travel time of all vehicles that reached their destination within the `simulation_time`. If no vehicles reached their destination, return 0.0.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large-scale graph:** The city graph can be large (e.g., thousands of intersections and road segments). Your solution must be efficient enough to handle such scales.
*   **Real-time routing:** The system needs to adapt to changing traffic conditions. Your algorithm should be able to re-route vehicles as needed during the simulation.
*   **Conflicting objectives:** Minimizing travel time and avoiding congestion are often conflicting objectives. Your solution needs to strike a balance between them.
*   **Time Complexity:** Consider the time complexity of your solution, especially as the number of vehicles and the size of the graph increase. Aim for a solution that is polynomial in the input size, but be prepared to justify your design choices if necessary.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases gracefully, such as vehicles with the same origin and destination, disconnected graphs, or road segments with zero capacity.
*   **Realistic Assumptions:**  You are encouraged to make reasonable assumptions about vehicle behavior (e.g., vehicles proceed at a constant speed on a road segment) to simplify the simulation. Document any such assumptions clearly.
*   **No External Libraries:**  You are limited to the Python Standard Library.  Libraries like `networkx` are forbidden. This is to encourage a deeper understanding of graph algorithms and data structure implementation.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and simulation techniques. It also requires careful consideration of efficiency and scalability. Good luck!

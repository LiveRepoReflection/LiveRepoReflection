## Question: Multi-Commodity Flow with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the delivery of multiple commodities from various source locations to their respective destination locations within a city. The city's road network is represented as a directed graph. Each edge in the graph represents a road segment with an associated travel time (in minutes) and a capacity limit (maximum number of commodity units that can traverse the road segment per minute).

Each commodity has a specific origin, destination, demand (number of units), and a time window within which the entire demand for that commodity must be fulfilled. The time window is defined by a start time and an end time (in minutes, relative to a common starting point).

Your goal is to determine a feasible flow schedule that satisfies all commodity demands within their respective time windows, while respecting the road segment capacities. Furthermore, you need to minimize the total travel time of all commodities (sum of travel time for each commodity unit).

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the road network. Keys are node IDs (integers), and values are lists of tuples. Each tuple represents an outgoing edge and contains the destination node ID, travel time (integer), and capacity (integer): `graph = {node_id: [(destination_node_id, travel_time, capacity), ...], ...}`
*   `commodities`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a commodity and contains the following keys:
    *   `origin`: The origin node ID (integer).
    *   `destination`: The destination node ID (integer).
    *   `demand`: The total demand for the commodity (integer).
    *   `start_time`: The earliest time the commodity can start being delivered (integer).
    *   `end_time`: The latest time the commodity must be fully delivered (integer).
*   `time_limit`: An integer representing the maximum allowed time (in minutes) to simulate the flow.

**Output:**

A dictionary representing the flow schedule. The keys are commodity IDs (integers, corresponding to the index of the commodity in the `commodities` list). The values are lists of tuples, where each tuple represents a flow event for that commodity and contains the following information:

*   `departure_time`: The time (in minutes) when the flow event starts from a node.
*   `path`: A list of node IDs representing the path taken by the flow event. This includes the origin and destination.
*   `amount`: The amount of commodity units transported in this flow event.

If no feasible solution exists, return an empty dictionary.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Feasibility:** All commodity demands must be fully satisfied within their respective time windows.
*   **Capacity:** The flow on each road segment at any given time must not exceed its capacity.
*   **Time Windows:** Deliveries for a commodity must occur entirely within its specified time window.
*   **Optimization:** Minimize the total travel time of all delivered commodities.
*   **Path Validity:** The `path` in each flow event must be a valid path in the `graph`.
*   **Non-Negative Flow:** The `amount` of commodity units in each flow event must be a non-negative integer.
*   **No Splitting Requirement:** Each unit of a commodity **must** follow the same path from origin to destination. While the flow may be split into different *flow events*, the individual units within *each flow event* must stay together.
*   **Efficiency:** Given a large graph and multiple commodities with tight time windows, your solution must be efficient. Inefficient brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   **Handling Congestion:** Your algorithm must effectively handle congestion by routing commodities through less congested paths or delaying deliveries to avoid exceeding capacity limits.
*   **Realistic Time Complexity:** An algorithm with polynomial time complexity in the size of the input is preferred.

**Example:**

(Illustrative - the actual graph and commodity data will be much larger and more complex in test cases).

```python
graph = {
    1: [(2, 10, 5), (3, 15, 3)], # Node 1: (Destination, Travel Time, Capacity)
    2: [(4, 8, 4)],
    3: [(4, 5, 2)],
    4: []
}

commodities = [
    {'origin': 1, 'destination': 4, 'demand': 4, 'start_time': 0, 'end_time': 30}
]
```
Good luck!

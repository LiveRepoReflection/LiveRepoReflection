## Question: Distributed Key-Value Store Consistency

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory, distributed key-value store. The store consists of `N` nodes (servers), where `N` can be a large number (e.g., 1000+). The store must provide eventual consistency. Your goal is to implement the core data structures and algorithms to handle concurrent read and write operations while ensuring that data eventually converges to a consistent state across all nodes.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Data Replication:** Each key-value pair is replicated across `R` nodes, where `R <= N`. The nodes to replicate to are determined by a consistent hashing function (you do not need to implement the hashing, assume you are given a function that takes a key and returns a list of `R` node IDs for replication).

2.  **Write Operations:** A write operation to a key updates the value on the `R` replica nodes. However, due to network latency or node failures, some writes might not be immediately reflected on all `R` nodes.

3.  **Read Operations:** A read operation for a key retrieves the value from `Q` replica nodes, where `Q <= R`. If the values retrieved from the `Q` nodes are not consistent (different versions of the same key exist), a reconciliation process must be initiated to determine the most recent value.

4.  **Version Vectors:** Each value is associated with a version vector to track the history of updates. A version vector is a list of integers, one integer per node in the cluster. When a value is updated on a node, that node's corresponding integer in the version vector is incremented.

5.  **Consistency Reconciliation:** During a read operation, if the retrieved values have conflicting version vectors, you need to implement a reconciliation algorithm. The reconciliation algorithm should determine the most recent value based on the version vectors. Specifically:
    *   If version vector A dominates version vector B (A[i] >= B[i] for all i, and A != B), then A is more recent.
    *   If version vector B dominates version vector A, then B is more recent.
    *   If neither dominates the other, then a conflict exists, and you need to merge the values (you can just pick the latest value based on a timestamp).

6.  **Gossip Protocol (Anti-Entropy):** To ensure eventual consistency, implement a simple gossip protocol. Each node periodically selects a random node in the cluster and exchanges key-value pairs. During the exchange, version vectors are compared, and the most recent values are propagated. If the remote node has a more recent value, the local node updates itself, and vice versa.

**Implementation Details:**

*   You are provided with:
    *   `N`: The number of nodes in the cluster.
    *   `R`: The replication factor.
    *   `Q`: The read quorum.
    *   `consistent_hash(key, N, R)`: A function that takes a key and returns a list of `R` node IDs to which the key should be replicated. Assume the node IDs range from 0 to N-1.
*   Implement the following functions:
    *   `write(key, value, node_id)`: Writes a key-value pair to the store, starting the write from `node_id`.
    *   `read(key, node_id)`: Reads the value for a given key from the store, starting the read from `node_id`.
    *   `gossip(node_id)`: Initiates the gossip protocol on a given `node_id`.
    *   `reconcile(values, version_vectors, timestamps)`: Takes a list of values, version vectors, and timestamps, and returns the most recent value.
*   Assume a simplified environment: No actual networking is required. You can represent the store as a shared data structure (e.g., a dictionary of dictionaries) accessible to all nodes.
*   You can use timestamps to resolve conflicts in the `reconcile` function, in case version vectors are incomparable.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `1 <= R <= N`
*   `1 <= Q <= R`
*   Keys and values are strings.
*   Minimize the number of round trips required for read and write operations.
*   Ensure that the gossip protocol eventually converges to a consistent state across all nodes.  In particular, all nodes should eventually agree on the latest value for each key.
*   Ensure your solution handles concurrent writes and reads safely.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   Correctness: Ensuring that the read operations return the most recent value after a series of write operations and gossip exchanges.
*   Efficiency: Minimizing the number of nodes contacted during read and write operations.
*   Scalability: Designing the data structures and algorithms so that the performance degrades gracefully as the number of nodes increases.
*   Concurrency Safety: Handling concurrent read and write operations without data corruption or race conditions.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, and algorithms. It tests your ability to design and implement a system that balances consistency, availability, and performance. Good luck!

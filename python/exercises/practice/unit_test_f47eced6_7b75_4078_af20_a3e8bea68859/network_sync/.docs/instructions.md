## Problem: Optimal Network Partitioning for Data Synchronization

### Description

You are tasked with designing a data synchronization strategy across a distributed network of interconnected data centers. Each data center holds a subset of the total data, and they need to synchronize their data periodically. The network is represented as an undirected graph where nodes are data centers and edges represent network connections between them. Each data center has a computational capacity, and each network connection has a bandwidth capacity.

Data synchronization occurs in rounds. In each round, you can choose to partition the network into several disjoint clusters. Within each cluster, data centers synchronize their data with each other. The synchronization process within a cluster is as follows:

1.  **Data Aggregation:** All data centers in a cluster send their data to a designated "leader" data center within that cluster. The leader aggregates all the data from the cluster. The time taken for this is proportional to the size of the data transferred and inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the connections used. To send the data from data center A to data center B within the cluster, you must choose exactly one path through the graph to do so. Since multiple data centers may send data to the leader, you must choose the paths such that the bandwidth capacity on any edge is not exceeded.
2.  **Data Distribution:** The leader data center then distributes the aggregated data back to all other data centers in the cluster. Again, the time taken is proportional to the data size and inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the connections used, and again you must choose paths that do not exceed the bandwidth capacity on any edge.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum time taken by any cluster in any synchronization round. The synchronization time for a cluster is the sum of the time taken for data aggregation and the time taken for data distribution.

You are given:

*   `n`: The number of data centers (nodes in the graph).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, bandwidth)`, where `u` and `v` are the indices of connected data centers (0-indexed), and `bandwidth` is the bandwidth capacity of the connection.
*   `data_sizes`: A list of integers, where `data_sizes[i]` represents the amount of data held by data center `i`.
*   `computational_capacities`: A list of integers, where `computational_capacities[i]` represents the computational capacity of data center `i`. The leader data center must have sufficient computational capacity to process all data aggregated in the cluster.
*   `k`: the maximum number of clusters allowed in a single round.

Your task is to write a function `min_max_synchronization_time(n, edges, data_sizes, computational_capacities, k)` that returns the minimum possible maximum synchronization time across all clusters in a single round, assuming the network is partitioned into at most `k` clusters. If no valid solution exists (e.g., no possible partitioning satisfies the computational capacity constraint), return `-1`.

### Constraints

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= k <= n`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= bandwidth <= 100`
*   `1 <= data_sizes[i] <= 100`
*   `1 <= computational_capacities[i] <= 10000`
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   You may assume that all data centers in a cluster must synchronize with each other in each round.
*   You can choose any data center in a cluster to be the leader.
*   The time taken for data transfer is calculated as `data_size / bandwidth`. You need to find the path with the minimum `data_size / bandwidth` to minimize the time taken. If a path does not exist from any node in the cluster to the cluster leader, then no cluster can be formed with this leader.
*   You should minimize the *maximum* synchronization time across *all* clusters.

### Optimization Requirements

*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit. Consider using appropriate algorithms and data structures to optimize performance.

### Example

```python
n = 4
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 8), (0, 3, 3)]
data_sizes = [10, 5, 7, 12]
computational_capacities = [20, 10, 15, 25]
k = 2

result = min_max_synchronization_time(n, edges, data_sizes, computational_capacities, k)
print(result) # Expected output: A float value representing the minimum maximum synchronization time.
```

### Hints

*   Consider using graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall to find shortest paths between data centers.
*   Think about how to efficiently explore different possible network partitions.
*   Implement a binary search approach on the possible synchronization times to check if a valid partitioning exists within that time.
*   Remember to consider edge cases and constraints carefully.
*   Consider the computational capacity constraint of the leader node.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints to find the optimal solution. Good luck!

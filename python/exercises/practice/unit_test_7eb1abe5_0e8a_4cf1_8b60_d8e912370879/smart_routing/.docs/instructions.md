## Question: Optimal Traffic Routing in a Smart City

**Problem Description:**

A smart city is represented as a weighted, directed graph. Each node in the graph represents a major intersection, and each directed edge represents a street connecting two intersections. The weight of an edge represents the estimated travel time along that street during peak hours.

The city wants to optimize traffic flow by strategically placing a limited number of "Smart Traffic Controllers" (STCs) at intersections. An STC, when placed at an intersection, can dynamically adjust traffic signals on *all* outgoing edges from that intersection, effectively *reducing* the travel time on those edges. Specifically, if an edge has a weight *w*, placing an STC at the source intersection reduces the weight to *floor(w / 2)*.

Given the city's road network (represented as a weighted, directed graph), the number of STCs available (*k*), a source intersection (*s*), and a destination intersection (*d*), your task is to determine the **minimum possible travel time** from *s* to *d*.

**Input:**

*   *n*: The number of intersections (nodes) in the city (numbered from 0 to n-1).
*   *edges*: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a directed edge from intersection *u* to intersection *v* with travel time *w*.
*   *k*: The number of STCs available.
*   *s*: The index of the source intersection.
*   *d*: The index of the destination intersection.

**Output:**

*   The minimum possible travel time from the source intersection *s* to the destination intersection *d* after optimally placing *k* STCs. If no path exists from *s* to *d*, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= *n* <= 200
*   0 <= *k* <= 20
*   0 <= *u*, *v* < *n*
*   1 <= *w* <= 1000
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   There can be multiple edges between two intersections.
*   The graph is represented as an adjacency list.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 15), (2, 3, 7), (3, 4, 8), (2,4,1)]
k = 1
s = 0
d = 4

Output: 9

Explanation:
Placing the STC at intersection 0 reduces the travel times of edges (0, 1) and (0, 2) to 5 and 2 respectively. A possible shortest path is 0 -> 2 -> 4, with a total travel time of 2 + 1 = 3. This is not the shortest. The shortest path would be 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 with travel time of 2 + 7 + 8 = 17. Alternatively, 0->2->4 with travel time of 2+1 = 3
If we were to place the STC at 1, possible shortest path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 ->4 with travel time of 10 + 2 + 1 = 13 or 0->1->3->4 with travel time of 10+15+8 = 33

Therefore, the best strategy in this case is to put the STC at intersection 2.
So, the travel times becomes (0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 15), (2, 3, 3), (3, 4, 8), (2,4,0)
The shortest path is 0->2->4 with the travel time of 5 + 0 = 5. It's not the shortest path. The shortest path would be 0->2->3->4 with travel time of 5+3+8=16

Let's put the STC at intersection 3.
So, the travel times becomes (0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 15), (2, 3, 7), (3, 4, 4), (2,4,1)
The shortest path is 0->2->4 with the travel time of 5 + 1 = 6. It's not the shortest path. The shortest path would be 0->2->3->4 with travel time of 5+7+4=16

Placing the STC at intersection 0 yields a minimum travel time of 9 (0->2->3->4) with (2+7+8) OR (0->1->2->4) with (5+2+1)
```

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The time complexity of your solution is crucial. A brute-force approach of trying all possible combinations of STC placements will likely time out.
*   Consider using efficient graph algorithms and data structures to minimize computation time.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph might be disconnected.
*   There might be no path from the source to the destination.
*   The number of STCs *k* might be 0.
*   The source and destination intersections might be the same.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and careful optimization to achieve an efficient solution. Good luck!

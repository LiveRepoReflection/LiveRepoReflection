Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test advanced skills, efficiency, and handling various edge cases:

## Project Name

`DistributedFileSystem`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a simplified distributed file system. This file system needs to support basic file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files across a cluster of interconnected storage nodes.

**System Design:**

*   **Storage Nodes:** The file system consists of `N` storage nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`.
*   **File Distribution:** Each file is divided into chunks. Each chunk is replicated across `K` distinct storage nodes to ensure data availability. `K` will always be significantly smaller than `N`.
*   **Metadata Management:** A central metadata server is responsible for tracking file metadata, including:
    *   File name
    *   File size
    *   Chunk locations (which storage nodes hold each chunk)
*   **Chunking:**  Files are divided into chunks of a fixed size `CHUNK_SIZE` bytes (assume `CHUNK_SIZE` is a constant). The last chunk of a file might be smaller than `CHUNK_SIZE`.
*   **Network Model:** Assume a reliable network where nodes can communicate directly with each other.
*   **File Path:** File paths are absolute and start with `/`.  File names can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
*   **Error Handling:** The system needs to handle potential errors, such as:
    *   File not found
    *   Insufficient storage nodes available for replication
    *   Invalid file paths
    *   Concurrent write access

**Your Task:**

Implement the following methods of a `DistributedFileSystem` class:

```python
class DistributedFileSystem:
    def __init__(self, num_storage_nodes: int, replication_factor: int):
        """
        Initializes the distributed file system.

        Args:
            num_storage_nodes: The number of storage nodes in the system.
            replication_factor: The number of replicas for each chunk.
        """
        pass

    def create_file(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        """
        Creates an empty file at the given file path.

        Returns:
            True if the file was successfully created, False otherwise (e.g., file already exists, invalid path).
        """
        pass

    def write_file(self, file_path: str, data: bytes) -> bool:
        """
        Writes the given data to the file at the given file path.
        Overwrites existing content.

        Returns:
            True if the data was successfully written, False otherwise (e.g., file not found, insufficient storage).
        """
        pass

    def read_file(self, file_path: str) -> bytes:
        """
        Reads the entire content of the file at the given file path.

        Returns:
            The file's content as bytes, or None if the file was not found.
        """
        pass

    def delete_file(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        """
        Deletes the file at the given file path.

        Returns:
            True if the file was successfully deleted, False otherwise (e.g., file not found).
        """
        pass
```

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** Your design should be scalable to a large number of files and storage nodes. Consider the efficiency of your metadata storage and access patterns.
2.  **Fault Tolerance:** Ensure data availability even if some storage nodes fail. This is achieved through the replication factor.
3.  **Concurrency:**  Implement basic concurrency control for write operations to prevent data corruption.  A simple locking mechanism is sufficient. Assume multiple clients might try to write to the same file.
4.  **Storage Allocation:** Implement a strategy for selecting storage nodes for chunk placement. Aim for even distribution of chunks across nodes. A naive random selection is acceptable, but bonus points for strategies that consider node capacity or network proximity (though you don't need to *actually* measure these, just simulate their impact).
5.  **Efficiency:** Optimize for read and write performance.  Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed metadata.
6.  **Real-World Considerations:**  Think about how your design would handle real-world scenarios like node failures, network partitions, and data inconsistencies. You don't need to implement full solutions for these, but your code comments should acknowledge these challenges and suggest potential mitigation strategies.
7.  **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large files.  Avoid loading entire files into memory at once.

**Assumptions:**

*   `CHUNK_SIZE` is a constant (e.g., 4096 bytes).  You can define it in your code.
*   The number of storage nodes `N` and the replication factor `K` are provided during initialization.
*   Storage nodes are reliable in the sense that once a chunk is written to a node, it is guaranteed to be stored correctly (no bit flips).
*   You do not need to implement data compression or encryption.
*   You can use Python's built-in `threading` module for concurrency control, if needed.
*   You can simulate storage nodes using in-memory data structures (e.g., dictionaries).  You don't need to interact with actual disk storage.
*   For testing, a simplified network model where you can directly access the data on any storage node.
*   Focus on correctness and design clarity first. Performance optimization is secondary.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does your code pass all test cases?
*   Design: Is your design well-structured, modular, and scalable?
*   Efficiency: Is your code efficient in terms of read/write performance and memory usage?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does your design adequately address fault tolerance?
*   Concurrency: Is concurrency handled correctly to prevent data corruption?
*   Code Clarity: Is your code well-documented and easy to understand?
*   Real-World Considerations: Does your code demonstrate an understanding of real-world challenges in distributed file systems?

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles.  It's designed to be challenging and require a significant amount of time and effort to solve correctly and efficiently. Good luck!

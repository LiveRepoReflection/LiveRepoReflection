Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level:

**Problem:** Optimal Multi-Source Routing in a Dynamic Network

**Description:**

You are given a network represented as a weighted, undirected graph. The network consists of `N` nodes, labeled from `0` to `N-1`, and `M` edges. The edges are represented by a list of tuples `(u, v, w)`, where `u` and `v` are the node indices connected by the edge, and `w` is the initial weight of the edge.

You are also given a list of `K` source nodes, `sources`. Your task is to find the minimum total cost to deliver data from *all* source nodes to *all* other nodes in the network.  Data from each source can be routed independently.

However, the network is dynamic. You are given a list of `Q` update operations. Each update operation is represented by a tuple `(t, u, v, new_w)`, where:

*   `t` is the timestamp of the update (updates are given in non-decreasing order of timestamp).
*   `u` and `v` are the node indices of the edge being updated.
*   `new_w` is the new weight of the edge `(u, v)`.  If the edge doesn't exist, the update creates the edge. If the edge exists but the weight is updated to a negative value, the weight should be considered as 0.

For each update operation, you must calculate and report the minimum total cost to deliver data from all source nodes to all other nodes *after* applying the update. This cost should be the sum of the shortest path distances from each source node to every other node in the graph.  Specifically, for each timestamp `t`, you need to calculate:

```
total_cost(t) = sum(shortest_path(source, node) for source in sources for node in range(N))
```

where `shortest_path(u, v)` is the length of the shortest path between nodes `u` and `v` in the current state of the graph. If there is no path between `u` and `v`, the shortest path is considered to be `infinity` (represented by `float('inf')` in Python).

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the graph (integer).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the initial edges in the graph: `[(u, v, w), ...]` (list of tuples, where `u`, `v` are integers and `w` is a non-negative integer).
*   `sources`: A list of source node indices (list of integers).
*   `updates`: A list of tuples representing the edge update operations: `[(t, u, v, new_w), ...]` (list of tuples, where `t`, `u`, `v` are integers and `new_w` is an integer).

**Output:**

*   A list of floats, where the i-th element is the `total_cost(t)` after applying the i-th update.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `0 <= M <= N * (N - 1) / 2` (Initial number of edges)
*   `1 <= K <= N`
*   `0 <= Q <= 1000` (Number of updates)
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `0 <= w <= 1000` (Initial edge weights)
*   `0 <= new_w <= 1000` (Updated edge weights)
*   Update timestamps are non-decreasing: `t1 <= t2 <= ... <= tQ`
* The timestamp `t` itself is not used in the calculation.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle the given constraints. A naive solution that recalculates all shortest paths after each update will likely time out. Consider using optimized graph algorithms and data structures.

**Key Challenges:**

*   **Dynamic Graph:** The graph changes with each update, requiring efficient handling of edge weight modifications.
*   **All-Pairs Shortest Paths:** Need to calculate shortest paths from multiple sources to all other nodes.
*   **Optimization:**  Finding the right optimization strategy to avoid recalculating everything from scratch for each update is crucial.  Consider how updates affect existing shortest paths.

This problem combines graph algorithms, dynamic programming concepts (potentially), and optimization techniques, making it a genuinely challenging and sophisticated coding task. Good luck!

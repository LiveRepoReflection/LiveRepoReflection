Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

```
Data Stream Anomaly Detection
```

### Question Description

You are building a real-time anomaly detection system for a high-volume data stream. The data stream consists of numerical values representing sensor readings from a distributed network. Your task is to design and implement an algorithm to identify anomalous data points in this stream.

**Data Characteristics:**

*   **Volume:** The data stream is characterized by its high throughput. You should assume a large number of data points arriving per second.
*   **Distribution:** The underlying distribution of the sensor readings is unknown and may change over time (concept drift).
*   **Seasonality:** The data may exhibit daily or weekly seasonality patterns.
*   **Noise:** The data contains inherent noise and occasional missing values, which should be handled appropriately.

**Anomaly Definition:**

An anomaly is defined as a data point that deviates significantly from the expected behavior of the data stream at a given time. This deviation can be due to various factors such as sensor malfunction, network issues, or genuine events of interest. You must consider both global anomalies (rare events that stand out from the entire dataset) and local anomalies (deviations from the immediate neighborhood of a data point).

**Requirements:**

1.  **Real-time Performance:** The anomaly detection algorithm must operate in real-time, with minimal latency. This means the processing time per data point should be kept as low as possible.

2.  **Adaptive Thresholding:** Since the data distribution is unknown and may change over time, the algorithm should employ adaptive thresholding techniques to dynamically adjust the sensitivity of the anomaly detection.

3.  **Seasonality Handling:** The algorithm should be able to account for seasonality patterns in the data.

4.  **Missing Value Handling:** The algorithm should handle missing data values gracefully, without causing significant disruptions.

5.  **Minimizing False Positives:** The algorithm should aim to minimize the rate of false positives (flagging normal data points as anomalies).

6.  **Memory Efficiency:** Given the continuous nature of the data stream, the algorithm should be memory efficient to avoid excessive resource consumption.

7.  **Scalability:** The solution should be designed to handle potentially large and growing data streams.

**Input:**

The input to your algorithm will be a stream of numerical values. You can represent this stream as an iterator or a generator function.

**Output:**

For each data point in the stream, your algorithm should output a boolean value indicating whether the data point is an anomaly (True) or not (False).

**Constraints:**

*   You should implement your solution in Python.
*   You are allowed to use standard Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`).
*   External dependencies should be minimized.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   Accuracy: Ability to correctly identify anomalies while minimizing false positives.
*   Performance: Processing time per data point.
*   Memory Efficiency: Memory usage of the algorithm.
*   Code Quality: Readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding best practices.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism for visualizing the detected anomalies in real-time.
*   Provide a configuration interface to adjust the parameters of the anomaly detection algorithm.
*   Explore and implement advanced anomaly detection techniques such as autoencoders or time series decomposition.

This problem encourages the use of various algorithmic techniques and data structures, and it requires careful consideration of trade-offs between accuracy, performance, and memory efficiency. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging problem designed with the criteria you specified:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Snapshot Isolation**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified, in-memory, distributed key-value store that supports transactional operations and snapshot isolation. The store consists of multiple nodes, and clients can connect to any node to initiate transactions.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Transactional Support:** Implement ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - although durability is simplified due to in-memory nature) for transactions. A transaction can consist of multiple read and write operations, and must either commit entirely or rollback.

2.  **Snapshot Isolation:** Transactions should operate on a consistent snapshot of the key-value store, taken at the beginning of the transaction. This means that a transaction should only see changes made by transactions that committed *before* its snapshot was taken. Transactions must not be blocked by other transactions.

3.  **Concurrency:**  Multiple transactions can execute concurrently.

4.  **Conflict Detection and Resolution:** Implement a mechanism to detect write-write conflicts between concurrent transactions. If a conflict is detected, one of the conflicting transactions must be rolled back.

5.  **Data Model:** The key-value store stores strings.

6.  **API:**  Implement the following API:

    *   `begin_transaction()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique transaction ID (TXID).
    *   `read(TXID, key)`: Reads the value associated with a given key within the context of the specified transaction. If the key does not exist, return `None`.
    *   `write(TXID, key, value)`: Writes a value to a given key within the context of the specified transaction.
    *   `commit_transaction(TXID)`: Attempts to commit the transaction with the given TXID. Returns `True` if the commit is successful, `False` if the transaction was rolled back due to a conflict.
    *   `rollback_transaction(TXID)`: Rolls back the transaction with the given TXID.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   You are working with a *single node* implementation. While the problem is "distributed" in name, focus on the transactional aspects as if nodes exist. This removes inter-node communication complexity.
*   All data is stored in memory. No need for disk persistence.
*   Assume a single-threaded client (no need to handle multiple threads from a single client).  However, *multiple clients* can connect and execute transactions concurrently.
*   Assume all keys and values are strings.
*   The number of keys and the size of values can be relatively large (e.g., up to 10,000 keys, values up to 1MB). Consider memory footprint.
*   Minimize the time it takes to read and write to the datastore within a transaction.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Read Performance:** Minimize read latency within a transaction.
*   **Write Performance:** Minimize the overhead of write operations (especially for transactions that eventually rollback).
*   **Memory Efficiency:** Design your data structures to minimize memory usage. Excessive memory consumption will lead to a failure.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:**  Does the implementation correctly implement transactional semantics and snapshot isolation?
*   **Concurrency:** Does the implementation handle concurrent transactions correctly, without data corruption or race conditions?
*   **Performance:** How efficiently does the implementation handle read and write operations, both in terms of time and memory?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, transactional concepts, and efficient data structures. Good luck!

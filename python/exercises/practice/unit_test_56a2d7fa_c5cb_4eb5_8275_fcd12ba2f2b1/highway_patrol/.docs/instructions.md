Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level.

**Problem Title:**  Optimal Highway Patrol Placement

**Problem Description:**

A major highway network connects `n` cities.  To combat the increasing rate of accidents, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has decided to strategically place patrol units along the highway.  The highway network is represented as a graph where cities are nodes (numbered 0 to n-1) and highway segments connecting cities are edges with varying lengths.

The DOT has data on the accident rate on each highway segment.  Each edge `(u, v)` has an associated accident risk score `r(u, v)`, representing the expected number of accidents per unit length of that segment per year.  The length of the highway segment connecting `u` and `v` is denoted as `l(u, v)`.  Therefore, the total expected accidents on segment `(u, v)` annually is `r(u, v) * l(u, v)`.

The goal is to place `k` patrol units in such a way as to minimize the total expected number of *unpatrolled* accidents across the entire highway network.  A highway segment `(u, v)` is considered patrolled if *either* city `u` *or* city `v` has a patrol unit stationed at it.

**Constraints:**

1.  `1 <= n <= 500` (Number of cities)
2.  `0 <= k <= n` (Number of patrol units)
3.  The highway network is guaranteed to be connected.
4.  `1 <= l(u, v) <= 100` for all highway segments `(u, v)`
5.  `1 <= r(u, v) <= 100` for all highway segments `(u, v)`
6.  The graph is undirected (highway segment `(u, v)` is the same as `(v, u)`)
7.  There is at most one highway segment between any two cities.
8.  You must use all `k` patrol units.
9.  Minimize the *total number of expected unpatrolled accidents*.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of cities (nodes).
*   `k`: The number of patrol units to place.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, l, r)` represents a highway segment:
    *   `u`: Index of the first city (0-indexed).
    *   `v`: Index of the second city (0-indexed).
    *   `l`: Length of the highway segment.
    *   `r`: Accident risk score of the highway segment.

**Output:**

A single integer representing the minimum possible total expected number of unpatrolled accidents after optimally placing the `k` patrol units.

**Example:**

```python
n = 4
k = 2
edges = [
    (0, 1, 10, 5),  # Cities 0 and 1, length 10, risk 5
    (1, 2, 15, 3),  # Cities 1 and 2, length 15, risk 3
    (2, 3, 5, 8),   # Cities 2 and 3, length 5, risk 8
    (0, 3, 20, 2)   # Cities 0 and 3, length 20, risk 2
]

# Expected Output:  0
# Explanation: Place patrol units at cities 0 and 2. All edges are now patrolled.

n = 5
k = 1
edges = [
    (0, 1, 10, 5),
    (1, 2, 15, 3),
    (2, 3, 5, 8),
    (0, 3, 20, 2),
    (3, 4, 7, 4)
]

# Expected Output: 150
# Explanation: Place patrol unit at city 0. The unpatrolled accidents will be (15 * 3) + (5 * 8) + (7 * 4) = 45 + 40 + 28 = 113 (Placing at 0)
#               Place patrol unit at city 1. The unpatrolled accidents will be (5 * 8) + (20 * 2) + (7 * 4) = 40 + 40 + 28 = 108 (Placing at 1)
#               Place patrol unit at city 2. The unpatrolled accidents will be (10 * 5) + (20 * 2) + (7 * 4) = 50 + 40 + 28 = 118 (Placing at 2)
#               Place patrol unit at city 3. The unpatrolled accidents will be (10 * 5) + (15 * 3) = 50 + 45 = 95 (Placing at 3)
#               Place patrol unit at city 4. The unpatrolled accidents will be (10 * 5) + (15 * 3) + (20 * 2) + (5 * 8) = 50 + 45 + 40 + 40 = 175 (Placing at 4)
# The minimum is to place the patrol unit at city 3

```

**Challenge Aspects:**

*   **Graph Representation:**  The input is a graph, so you'll need to efficiently represent and traverse it.
*   **Combinatorial Optimization:** You need to explore different combinations of patrol unit placements to find the optimal one. This can lead to exponential time complexity if not handled carefully.
*   **Dynamic Programming (Potentially):**  Consider if dynamic programming techniques can be applied to optimize the search for the best placement.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Think about cases where `k = 0` (no patrol units) or `k = n` (patrol units at every city).
*   **Efficiency:**  A naive brute-force approach will likely time out for larger graphs. The solution should aim for a time complexity better than O(nCk * m), where m is the number of edges.

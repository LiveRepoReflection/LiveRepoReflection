Okay, here's a challenging programming problem for a competition, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world constraints.

**Problem Title:**  Inter-City Express Route Optimization

**Problem Description:**

A new high-speed rail network is being built to connect several major cities across the country. Your task is to design an optimal train routing system that minimizes the total operational cost while adhering to strict time constraints and service level agreements.

You are given the following information:

1.  **Cities:** A list of `N` cities represented by unique IDs (integers from 0 to N-1).
2.  **Rail Network:** A directed graph where nodes represent cities, and edges represent rail lines connecting the cities. Each rail line has:
    *   A `travel_time` (in minutes).
    *   An `operational_cost_per_minute`.
    *   A `capacity` representing the maximum number of trains that can use the line per day.
3.  **Demand:** A matrix `demand[i][j]` representing the number of passengers that need to travel from city `i` to city `j` daily.
4.  **Train Capacity:** Each train can carry a maximum of `train_capacity` passengers.
5.  **Time Windows:** For each city pair `(i, j)`, there is a `time_window` represented by a tuple `(earliest_departure, latest_arrival)`. The train departing from city `i` must arrive at city `j` within this time window. Times are expressed in minutes from the start of the day (0 to 1440).
6.  **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** At least `SLA_percentage` of the total passenger demand for each city pair must be satisfied.
7.  **Fixed Costs:** Each train dispatched incurs a fixed cost, `fixed_cost_per_train`.

**Objective:**

Minimize the total operational cost, which is the sum of:

*   The cost of using each rail line (calculated as `operational_cost_per_minute * travel_time * number_of_trains_using_the_line`).
*   The fixed cost for each train dispatched (calculated as `fixed_cost_per_train * total_number_of_trains`).

While satisfying:

*   All passenger demand within the specified time windows, respecting train capacity.
*   The Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each city pair.
*   The capacity constraint of each rail line.

**Input:**

*   `N` (integer): The number of cities.
*   `graph` (list of tuples): A list of tuples representing the rail network. Each tuple has the format `(start_city, end_city, travel_time, operational_cost_per_minute, capacity)`.
*   `demand` (list of lists of integers): A 2D list representing the passenger demand between cities. `demand[i][j]` is the demand from city `i` to city `j`.
*   `train_capacity` (integer): The capacity of a single train.
*   `time_windows` (list of lists of tuples): A 3D list representing the time windows for each city pair. `time_windows[i][j]` is a tuple `(earliest_departure, latest_arrival)` for travel from city `i` to city `j`.
*   `SLA_percentage` (float): The minimum percentage of demand that must be satisfied (0.0 to 1.0).
*   `fixed_cost_per_train` (integer): The fixed cost for each train dispatched.

**Output:**

*   A float representing the minimum total operational cost that satisfies all constraints. If no solution exists that satisfies all constraints, return -1.0.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 20
*   0 <= start_city, end_city < N
*   1 <= travel_time <= 600 (minutes)
*   0.1 <= operational_cost_per_minute <= 10.0
*   1 <= capacity <= 100
*   0 <= demand[i][j] <= 1000
*   10 <= train_capacity <= 200
*   0 <= earliest_departure < latest_arrival <= 1440
*   0.5 <= SLA_percentage <= 1.0
*   100 <= fixed_cost_per_train <= 5000
*   The graph may not be complete.  There might not be a path between every pair of cities.
*   Multiple rail lines may exist between the same pair of cities, but they will have different characteristics (travel time, cost, capacity).
*   The solution must be optimal or near-optimal within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 minutes).  Partial credit will be given for solutions that satisfy the constraints but are not provably optimal.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged on:

*   **Correctness:** Does the solution satisfy all constraints (demand, SLA, capacity, time windows)?
*   **Optimality:** How close is the solution to the optimal cost?
*   **Efficiency:** How quickly does the solution run, especially as the input size increases?

**Hints:**

*   This problem can be approached using graph algorithms, linear programming, or constraint programming.
*   Consider using shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's or A\*) to find feasible routes between cities within the time windows.
*   Think about how to efficiently allocate trains to routes to satisfy demand while minimizing cost.
*   Pay attention to edge cases and boundary conditions.

This problem requires careful planning, efficient algorithms, and strong coding skills. Good luck!

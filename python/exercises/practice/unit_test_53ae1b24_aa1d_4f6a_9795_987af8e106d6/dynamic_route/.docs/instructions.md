Okay, I understand. Here is a challenging Python coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and handle various edge cases.

## Question: Efficient Route Planning with Dynamic Obstacles

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient route planning system for autonomous delivery drones operating in a dynamic urban environment. The city is represented as a grid of size `N x N`, where each cell can be either traversable or blocked by a building. Drones can only move horizontally or vertically (no diagonal movement).

Initially, you are given a static map of the city representing permanent obstacles. However, the environment is dynamic. Temporary obstacles like construction zones or events can appear and disappear at unpredictable locations and times. Your system must efficiently handle these dynamic changes and re-route the drones accordingly.

Your system needs to support the following operations:

1.  **`initialize_map(grid)`:** Takes a 2D list `grid` representing the initial city map. `grid[i][j] = 0` indicates a traversable cell, and `grid[i][j] = 1` indicates a permanent obstacle.

2.  **`add_obstacle(x, y)`:** Adds a temporary obstacle at cell `(x, y)`.  If the cell already contains a permanent obstacle or a temporary obstacle, this operation has no effect.

3.  **`remove_obstacle(x, y)`:** Removes a temporary obstacle at cell `(x, y)`. If the cell does not contain a temporary obstacle, this operation has no effect. Removing a permanent obstacle is not allowed.

4.  **`find_shortest_path(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)`:** Finds the shortest path from cell `(start_x, start_y)` to cell `(end_x, end_y)` avoiding both permanent and temporary obstacles. The path should be a list of `(x, y)` coordinates representing the sequence of cells to visit. If no path exists, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= x, y, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y < N`
*   The starting and ending cells are always traversable in the initial map (though they may become blocked temporarily).
*   The `find_shortest_path` function must be optimized for fast query times, as it will be called frequently.
*   The operations `add_obstacle` and `remove_obstacle` should also be reasonably efficient.
*   Multiple drones may request paths concurrently, so thread safety is an additional consideration (though you are not explicitly required to implement threading).
*   The code must be written in Python.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The `find_shortest_path` function must be highly optimized.  A naive approach like repeatedly running a standard shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's or A\*) will likely time out for large grids and frequent updates.  Consider strategies like pre-computation or incremental updates to the pathfinding data structures.

**Example:**

```python
# Initial map (0 = traversable, 1 = obstacle)
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Initialize the route planning system
route_planner = RoutePlanner(grid)

# Find a path from (0, 0) to (3, 3)
path1 = route_planner.find_shortest_path(0, 0, 3, 3)
print(path1)  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] (or a similar valid path)

# Add a temporary obstacle
route_planner.add_obstacle(2, 1)

# Find a path again (it should avoid the new obstacle)
path2 = route_planner.find_shortest_path(0, 0, 3, 3)
print(path2)  # Output: A path avoiding (2, 1), e.g., [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]

# Remove the temporary obstacle
route_planner.remove_obstacle(2, 1)

# Find the path again (it should now be the same as path1 or a similar valid path)
path3 = route_planner.find_shortest_path(0, 0, 3, 3)
print(path3) # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] (or a similar valid path)
```

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structure design, and optimization techniques. The key is to find a way to efficiently update the pathfinding information when temporary obstacles are added or removed, rather than recomputing the shortest path from scratch each time. Good luck!

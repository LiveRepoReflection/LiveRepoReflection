## Problem: Optimal Multi-Resource Allocation in a Microgrid

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a resource allocation system for a smart microgrid. The microgrid consists of a number of energy resources (solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, and a connection to the main power grid) and a number of energy consumers (residential buildings, commercial buildings, and electric vehicle charging stations).

Each resource has a maximum capacity and a cost function associated with its use. Solar and wind have near-zero cost but limited and fluctuating availability. Battery storage has a limited capacity and incurs degradation costs with each charge/discharge cycle. The main grid provides a reliable, but more expensive, source of power.

Each consumer has a time-varying energy demand that must be met. The goal is to allocate the available resources to meet the demands of all consumers at the lowest possible cost, while respecting the constraints of each resource and ensuring grid stability.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following information:

*   `resources`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an energy resource. Each resource dictionary contains the following keys:
    *   `type`: A string representing the resource type ("solar", "wind", "battery", "grid").
    *   `capacity`: An integer representing the maximum capacity of the resource (in kWh).
    *   `availability`: A list of floats representing the availability of the resource at each time step (only for "solar" and "wind"). Values range from 0.0 to 1.0.
    *   `cost`: A list of floats representing the cost per kWh of using the resource at each time step (only for "grid").
    *   `initial_charge`: An integer representing the initial charge of the battery (in kWh) (only for "battery").
    *   `charge_rate`: An integer representing the maximum charge rate of the battery (in kWh) (only for "battery").
    *   `discharge_rate`: An integer representing the maximum discharge rate of the battery (in kWh) (only for "battery").
    *   `degradation_cost`: A float representing the cost incurred per kWh charged or discharged from the battery (only for "battery").

*   `consumers`: A list of lists, where each list represents the energy demand of a consumer at each time step (in kWh).

*   `time_steps`: An integer representing the total number of time steps.

**Output:**

The output should be a list of lists, where each list represents the allocation of energy from each resource to each consumer at each time step. The outer list represents the time steps, and the inner list represents the resources. The value at `output[t][r]` represents the amount of energy (in kWh) allocated from resource `r` to consumer `t` at time step `t`. Also, the output needs to include the total cost of the energy consumption at the end.
The output format should be:
```
{
    "allocations": [[allocation_from_resource_1_to_consumer_1, allocation_from_resource_1_to_consumer_2, ...],
                    [allocation_from_resource_2_to_consumer_1, allocation_from_resource_2_to_consumer_2, ...],
                    ...],
    "total_cost": total_energy_cost
}
```

**Constraints:**

*   The total energy allocated from a resource at any time step cannot exceed its capacity or availability (for solar and wind).
*   The total energy allocated to a consumer at any time step must meet its demand.
*   The battery's charge level must remain within its capacity at all times.
*   The battery's charge and discharge rates must not exceed their limits.
*   Minimize the total cost of energy consumption.
*   0 <= `time_steps` <= 100
*   0 <= number of resources <= 10
*   0 <= number of consumers <= 10
* All inputs are non-negative and valid.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be computationally efficient, especially for a large number of resources, consumers, and time steps. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   The solution should aim to minimize the total cost of energy consumption, considering both the cost of energy from the grid and the degradation cost of the battery.

**Real-World Considerations:**

*   This problem models a simplified version of a real-world microgrid resource allocation problem. In reality, there are many other factors to consider, such as transmission losses, voltage stability, and forecasting uncertainty.
*   The problem highlights the importance of optimizing resource allocation to reduce costs and improve the reliability and sustainability of microgrids.

**Example:**

Let's assume you have 1 solar panel with a capacity of 10 kWh, 1 battery with capacity 5 kWh, initial charge 2 kWh, charge rate of 2 kWh, discharge rate of 2 kWh, and a degradation cost of 0.1 per kWh. There is also one consumer with a demand of 7 kWh for a total of 2 timesteps. The solar panel availability is [0.5, 0.8] at each timestep and grid cost is [0.2, 0.3] at each timestep. Then, you need to meet the demand with solar and battery first and use the grid at last.

## Project Name

`Optimal Router Placement`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a network infrastructure for a new smart city. The city can be represented as a graph where nodes represent buildings and edges represent possible cable connections between them. The goal is to determine the **minimum number of routers** required and their optimal placement to ensure that every building has a strong and reliable internet connection.

Each router has a limited signal range `R`. A building is considered to have a strong connection if it either has a router installed in it, or it is within the signal range `R` of at least one router. The distance between two buildings is measured by the shortest path (minimum number of hops) between their corresponding nodes in the graph.

However, due to budget constraints, you can only use a limited number of **high-capacity routers** (capacity `C`). Each high-capacity router can support up to `K` directly connected buildings (buildings connected by an edge). Any building directly connected to the high-capacity router is considered a served user. The city wants to maximize the number of served users.

The challenge is further complicated by the presence of strategic buildings called **critical infrastructure** (e.g., hospitals, police stations), which **must** have a router directly installed within them.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of buildings in the city (nodes in the graph). Buildings are numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an undirected edge between building `u` and building `v`.
*   `R`: The signal range of the routers.
*   `C`: The number of high-capacity routers you can use.
*   `K`: The maximum number of directly connected buildings that a high-capacity router can support.
*   `critical_buildings`: A list of building IDs that must have a router installed.

**Output:**

A tuple containing:

1.  The minimum number of routers required to cover all buildings.
2.  A list of building IDs where routers should be placed, including the critical infrastructure.
3.  The maximum number of served users by high-capacity routers given optimal placement.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 500
*   0 <= number of `edges` <= `N * (N - 1) / 2` (a complete graph)
*   1 <= `R` <= 5
*   0 <= `C` <= 50
*   1 <= `K` <= 10
*   0 <= number of `critical_buildings` <= `N`
*   It is guaranteed that a solution exists.  The input graph is connected.
*   Your solution must run within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the total number of routers used.
*   Maximize the number of served users by high-capacity routers.
*   Critical infrastructure *must* have routers.

**Example:**

```python
N = 7
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]
R = 1
C = 2
K = 3
critical_buildings = [0, 6]

# A possible output (the exact output may vary as multiple optimal solutions may exist):
# (4, [0, 2, 4, 6], 6)
# Explanation:
# - 4 routers are needed.
# - Routers are placed at buildings 0, 2, 4, and 6.
# - High-capacity routers at 0 and 6 serve a total of 6 users (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1).
```

**Considerations:**

*   How to efficiently calculate shortest paths in the graph.
*   How to handle the constraint of critical infrastructure.
*   How to optimize router placement to minimize the total number of routers.
*   How to choose the best locations for the high-capacity routers to maximize served users.
*   Explore different algorithmic approaches and their trade-offs (e.g., greedy, dynamic programming, approximation algorithms).
*   The test cases will include a range of graph structures (sparse, dense, trees) and varying parameters.

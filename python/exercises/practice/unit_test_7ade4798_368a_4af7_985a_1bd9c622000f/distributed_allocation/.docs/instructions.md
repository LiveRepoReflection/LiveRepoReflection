## Problem: Optimized Resource Allocation in a Distributed System

### Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing resource allocation in a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` worker nodes and `M` independent tasks that need to be executed. Each worker node has a limited capacity of available resources, represented by an integer. Each task requires a specific amount of resources to be executed, also represented by an integer.

The goal is to design an algorithm that efficiently assigns tasks to worker nodes, minimizing the overall execution time. However, the system has some constraints:

*   **Resource Constraint:** A worker node cannot execute a task if it doesn't have enough available resources. After a task is completed, the resources are released back to the worker node.

*   **Task Dependencies:** Some tasks depend on the completion of other tasks. These dependencies are represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A task can only be executed if all its dependencies have been completed.

*   **Communication Overhead:** When a worker node completes a task, the results may need to be transferred to other worker nodes that depend on those results. This transfer incurs a communication overhead, which is proportional to the amount of resources used by the completed task and the distance between the worker nodes. Assume the distance between any two worker nodes is 1.

*   **Dynamic Task Arrival:** New tasks might arrive dynamically during the execution. Your algorithm should be able to accommodate these new tasks without restarting the entire allocation process.

*   **Preemption is not allowed:** Once a task is assigned to a worker, it should finish there.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of worker nodes.
*   `M`: The initial number of tasks.
*   `worker_capacities`: A list of integers representing the resource capacity of each worker node. `worker_capacities[i]` represents the capacity of the i-th worker node.
*   `task_resources`: A list of integers representing the resource requirements of each task. `task_resources[j]` represents the resource requirement of the j-th task.
*   `task_dependencies`: A list of lists representing the task dependencies. `task_dependencies[j]` represents a list of tasks that the j-th task depends on.  For example, `task_dependencies[j] = [1, 2]` means task `j` depends on tasks `1` and `2`. Tasks are 0-indexed.
*   `new_tasks`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a new task and its dependencies arriving at a specific time. Each tuple is in the format `(arrival_time, resource_requirement, dependencies)`. `arrival_time` is an integer, `resource_requirement` is an integer, and `dependencies` is a list of integers representing the tasks that the new task depends on.

**Output:**

The algorithm should return a list of integers representing the worker node assigned to each task. `allocation[j]` represents the worker node assigned to the j-th task. If a task cannot be assigned to any worker node due to resource constraints or dependencies, assign it to -1. The list should have a length equals to the initial number of tasks plus the total number of dynamically arrived new tasks.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 100
*   1 <= `M` <= 1000
*   1 <= `worker_capacities[i]` <= 1000
*   1 <= `task_resources[j]` <= 1000
*   The task dependency graph is a valid DAG.
*   The number of new tasks <= 500
*   `arrival_time` is non-decreasing.
*   Your algorithm must be efficient enough to handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes. Aim for a solution that scales well with the input size.

**Example:**

```python
N = 3
M = 5
worker_capacities = [50, 60, 70]
task_resources = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
task_dependencies = [[], [0], [0, 1], [2], []]
new_tasks = [(10, 25, [1, 3]), (20, 35, [4])]

allocation = solve(N, M, worker_capacities, task_resources, task_dependencies, new_tasks)
print(allocation)

# Possible Output:
# [0, 1, 2, -1, 0, 1, -1] (this is just an example, other valid allocations are possible)
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The algorithm should correctly assign tasks to worker nodes, respecting resource constraints and task dependencies.
*   Efficiency: The algorithm should be efficient and scale well with the input size. Solutions with significantly better time complexity will be favored.
*   Handling Dynamic Task Arrival: The algorithm should be able to accommodate new tasks without restarting the entire allocation process.
*   Minimizing Execution Time: The primary goal is to minimize the overall execution time of all tasks, considering resource usage and communication overhead. This is hard to measure perfectly, but the better your solution is, the better score you will get.

This problem requires you to combine graph algorithms, resource management techniques, and optimization strategies to achieve the best possible performance. Good luck!

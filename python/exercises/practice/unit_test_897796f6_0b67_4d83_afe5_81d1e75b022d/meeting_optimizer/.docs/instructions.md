Okay, here's a challenging problem description based on your request.

**Project Name:** `OptimalMeetingPoint`

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are designing a system for a large distributed team working on a critical project. Team members are located in various cities across the globe. Due to the project's urgency, a series of physical meetings are deemed necessary. You need to determine the optimal meeting point to minimize the overall travel cost for all team members.

You are given:

1.  **A list of cities:** Each city is represented by a unique string identifier (e.g., "New York", "London", "Tokyo").
2.  **Team member locations:** A dictionary where keys are team member IDs (integers) and values are the city where they are currently located. Multiple team members can reside in the same city.
3.  **Travel Costs:** A function `get_travel_cost(city1, city2)` that returns the cost of travel between two cities.  This cost is not necessarily symmetrical (i.e., `get_travel_cost(city1, city2)` might not equal `get_travel_cost(city2, city1)`). Assume this function is computationally expensive.
4.  **Meeting Cadence:** An integer `K` indicating the number of meetings that will occur.

The goal is to find the single "meeting city" that minimizes the *total travel cost* for *all K meetings*. The total travel cost is calculated as the sum of the travel costs for each team member to travel from their origin city to the meeting city, summed across all K meetings.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Computational Efficiency:** The number of cities can be large (up to 10^5). The number of team members can also be large (up to 10^6). Calling `get_travel_cost()` should be minimized due to its computational expense. Strive for solutions better than O(N\*M) where N is number of cities and M is number of team members.
*   **Non-Euclidean Costs:**  `get_travel_cost()` does not represent Euclidean distance.  It could represent flight prices, timezones crossing penalties, or other complex factors.
*   **Meeting Frequency:** Each team member must attend all K meetings.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the team is empty, or all team members are already in the same city.
*   **Real-world practical scenarios:** Consider the problem in terms of a system design. Your function would be a single component in a larger system. How would you handle scaling, caching, and potential updates to travel costs in a real-world implementation?

**Specific Requirements:**

Write a function `find_optimal_meeting_point(cities, team_locations, get_travel_cost, K)` that returns the string identifier of the city that minimizes the total travel cost for all K meetings. If there are multiple cities with the same minimal cost, return any one of them.

This problem encourages the use of efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize the number of calls to the `get_travel_cost()` function.  It also requires careful consideration of edge cases and real-world constraints. Good luck!

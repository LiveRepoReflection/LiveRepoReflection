Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level, incorporating elements you requested:

**Project Name:** `ScalableSocialNetwork`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a simplified, scalable social network.  The core functionality revolves around managing users, their connections (friends), and efficiently retrieving a ranked list of "influencers" within a specified degree of separation.

**Data Model:**

*   **User:** Each user has a unique user ID (an integer), a name (string), and other attributes (represented as a dictionary of key-value pairs; the keys and values are strings. Examples: `{"location": "New York", "interests": "coding, hiking"}`).
*   **Friendships:** Friendships are bidirectional and represented as edges in a graph.  A user can have any number of friends.

**API Requirements:**

Implement the following methods within the `SocialNetwork` class:

1.  `add_user(user_id: int, name: str, attributes: Dict[str, str]) -> bool`: Adds a new user to the network. Returns `True` if the user was successfully added (i.e., the `user_id` was not already in use), `False` otherwise.
2.  `add_friendship(user_id1: int, user_id2: int) -> bool`: Creates a friendship between two users.  Returns `True` if the friendship was successfully added (i.e., the users exist and the friendship didn't already exist), `False` otherwise.  Friendships are bidirectional (if A is friends with B, B is friends with A).
3.  `get_friends(user_id: int) -> Set[int]`: Returns a set of user IDs that are direct friends of the given user.  Returns an empty set if the user does not exist or has no friends.
4.  `get_user_attributes(user_id: int) -> Dict[str, str]`: Returns a dictionary of attributes for the user or an empty dictionary if the user does not exist.
5.  `get_influencers(user_id: int, degree: int, attribute_key: str) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`: This is the core, challenging method.  It returns a ranked list of influencers within a specified *degree* of separation from a given *user*.

    *   `user_id`: The starting user.
    *   `degree`: The maximum degree of separation to consider (e.g., `degree=1` means direct friends, `degree=2` means friends of friends, and so on).  A degree of 0 includes the user itself.
    *   `attribute_key`: The attribute key to use for ranking. The value of this attribute will be converted to an integer value to determine the influencer score.

    **Ranking Criteria:**

    1.  **Reach:** For each user within the specified degree of separation, retrieve the value associated with `attribute_key`. If the value is not present, or can't be converted to an integer, treat it as 0.  This integer value represents the user's "reach".
    2.  **Rank:** Rank the users based on their "reach" in *descending order*. Users with higher "reach" are ranked higher.
    3.  **Tie-breaking:** If two or more users have the same "reach", break the tie by sorting them in *ascending order* of their `user_id`.
    4.  **Output:** Return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the `user_id` and their "reach" `(user_id, reach)`. The list should be sorted according to the ranking criteria.  The starting `user_id` should **always** be included in the result, if they exist, even if they have a reach of 0. Only include each user_id once.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Scale:** The network can contain a very large number of users (millions).  Optimize your data structures and algorithms for performance.
*   **Memory:**  Be mindful of memory usage. Avoid loading the entire graph into memory if possible.
*   **Invalid Input:** Handle cases where `user_id` does not exist, `degree` is negative, or `attribute_key` is missing from a user's attributes gracefully.
*   **Cycles:** The graph may contain cycles. Your algorithm should handle cycles correctly and avoid infinite loops.
*   **Concurrency:**  Assume the `SocialNetwork` class might be accessed by multiple threads concurrently.  Consider thread safety.
*   **Integer Conversion:** If a user's attribute value cannot be converted to an integer, treat it as `0`.
*   **No External Libraries:** You can only use built-in Python data structures and modules.  No external libraries like `networkx` are allowed.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The `get_influencers` method is the performance bottleneck. Optimize it for speed. Consider using efficient graph traversal algorithms and data structures. Aim for a solution with a time complexity of O(V + E) for the `get_influencers` method, where V is the number of vertices (users) and E is the number of edges (friendships) within the specified degree of separation.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and concurrency to create a scalable and efficient social network. Good luck!

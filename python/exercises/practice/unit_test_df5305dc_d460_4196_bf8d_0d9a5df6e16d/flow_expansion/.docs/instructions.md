Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and require a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and optimization.

**Problem Title: Multi-Commodity Flow with Capacity Expansion**

**Problem Description:**

You are managing a network of pipelines responsible for transporting various commodities (e.g., oil, gas, water) between different locations. The network is represented as a directed graph where nodes are locations (cities, processing plants) and edges are pipelines connecting them. Each pipeline has an initial capacity, representing the maximum amount of commodity that can flow through it.

You are given:

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network, labeled from 0 to n-1.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, initial_capacity)`, representing directed edges from node `u` to node `v` with an initial capacity of `initial_capacity`.
*   `commodities`: A list of tuples `(source, destination, demand)`, representing the demand for each commodity. `source` is the starting node, `destination` is the ending node, and `demand` is the amount of commodity that needs to be transported from the source to the destination. Multiple commodities can share the same source or destination.

Due to increasing demand, you need to ensure that you can satisfy all commodity demands. To achieve this, you can expand the capacity of any pipeline. Expanding a pipeline with edge `(u, v)` by one unit of capacity costs `cost(u, v)`, where `cost(u, v)` is a non-negative integer and can be different for each edge. Capacity can be expanded to any non-negative integer.

Your task is to find the *minimum total cost* required to expand the capacity of the pipelines such that you can simultaneously satisfy the demand for all commodities. If it's impossible to satisfy all demands, even with infinite capacity expansion, return -1.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Network Size:** `1 <= n <= 100`
*   **Number of Edges:** `1 <= len(edges) <= 200`
*   **Number of Commodities:** `1 <= len(commodities) <= 10`
*   **Initial Capacity:** `0 <= initial_capacity <= 100`
*   **Demand:** `1 <= demand <= 100`
*   **Capacity Expansion Cost:** The cost to increase the capacity of an edge is a non-negative integer. The cost can be different for each edge. The total cost should fit in a 64-bit integer.
*   **Flow Conservation:** For each node (except source and destination for each commodity), the total inflow must equal the total outflow.
*   **Optimization:** The solution must be efficient. A naive approach will likely time out. Consider using appropriate algorithms and data structures.
*   **Simultaneous Flow:**  All commodity flows must be routed through the network *simultaneously*.  This is a multi-commodity flow problem, not separate single-commodity flow problems.
*   **Edge Costs:** The edge costs are provided as a function `cost(u, v)`. The solver needs to call this function to determine the cost for each unit of capacity expansion on each edge.

This problem requires understanding of:

*   Graph theory
*   Network flow algorithms (e.g., Min-Cost Max-Flow)
*   Optimization techniques
*   Potentially linear programming or related approaches to handle the multi-commodity aspect.

Good luck!

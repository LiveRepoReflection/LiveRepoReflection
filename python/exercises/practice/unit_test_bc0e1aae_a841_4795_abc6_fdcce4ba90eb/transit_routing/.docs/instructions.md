Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to test advanced Python skills, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world constraints.

**Problem Title:  Optimal Public Transit Routing with Real-Time Disruptions**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing algorithm for a public transit system in a large city. The transit system consists of:

*   **Stations:** Represented as nodes in a graph. Each station has a unique ID (integer).
*   **Routes:** Represented as directed edges in the graph. Each route connects two stations and has a fixed travel time (integer, in minutes).  A station can have multiple routes leaving/entering.
*   **Timetables:** Each route has a timetable specifying departure times from the origin station and arrival times at the destination station.  These times are integers representing minutes past midnight.  Assume timetables repeat daily.
*   **Real-time Disruptions:**  Routes can be temporarily blocked due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., maintenance, accidents).  These disruptions are communicated to the system in real-time as a list of blocked route IDs and a time duration (in minutes) for which they are blocked.

Given a transit system, a starting station, a destination station, a departure time (in minutes past midnight), and a list of real-time disruptions, your goal is to find the *fastest* route from the starting station to the destination station, considering the timetables and real-time disruptions.

**Input:**

*   `stations`: A list of integers representing station IDs.
*   `routes`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(start_station_id, end_station_id, route_id, travel_time)` represents a route. `start_station_id` and `end_station_id` are integers (station IDs), `route_id` is a unique identifier for the route (integer), and `travel_time` is an integer representing the travel time in minutes.
*   `timetables`: A dictionary where the key is `route_id` and the value is a list of departure times (integers representing minutes past midnight). These times are sorted in ascending order.
*   `start_station`: The ID of the starting station (integer).
*   `destination_station`: The ID of the destination station (integer).
*   `departure_time`: The desired departure time from the starting station (integer, minutes past midnight).
*   `disruptions`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(route_id, start_time, duration)` represents a disruption. `route_id` is the ID of the blocked route (integer), `start_time` is the time (in minutes past midnight) when the route becomes blocked, and `duration` is the duration (in minutes) for which the route is blocked.  Disruptions may overlap.

**Output:**

*   The minimum arrival time (in minutes past midnight) at the destination station, or `-1` if no route is found.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of stations can be up to 10,000.
*   The number of routes can be up to 100,000.
*   The number of timetables per route can be up to 1,000.
*   The number of real-time disruptions can be up to 1,000.
*   Travel times are positive integers.
*   You must account for waiting time at stations for the next available route (based on the timetable).  You arrive at a station at a certain time, and you can only depart on a route that leaves *after* that time.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient.  Naive brute-force approaches will likely time out.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   When considering disruptions, you cannot travel on a route during the disrupted time window. If you *arrive* at a station and the *next* route you want to take is disrupted *at that time*, you must wait for the disruption to end before taking the route.

**Example:**

Let's say a route has departure times `[60, 120, 180]`. You arrive at the station at time `70`. You must wait until time `120` to take the next route.

**Note:**

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal (Dijkstra's algorithm or similar), timetable management, and disruption handling. The efficiency of your solution will depend on your choice of algorithms and data structures. Consider using priority queues (heaps) for efficient node selection in the graph traversal and binary search or similar techniques for finding the next available departure time in the timetable.  Careful handling of edge cases and time calculations (wrapping around midnight) is also crucial. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and computational complexity when choosing your data structures.

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Python coding problem designed with the considerations you've outlined:

## Project Name

`Network Congestion Mitigation`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a system to mitigate network congestion in a large distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`.  These nodes communicate with each other by sending packets over a shared network. Due to the nature of the applications running on these nodes, certain pairs of nodes communicate much more frequently than others.

You are given the following information:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)`, where `u` and `v` are node IDs representing an edge between node `u` and node `v`, and `w` is the *estimated* average bandwidth usage (in Mbps) of the connection between `u` and `v`.  The edges are undirected, meaning traffic can flow in both directions between `u` and `v`. It's possible to have multiple edges between the same two nodes, in which case their bandwidth usages should be considered independently.
*   `capacity`: A single integer representing the total bandwidth capacity (in Mbps) of the entire network.

Your goal is to implement a function `mitigate_congestion(N, edges, capacity)` that returns a list of tuples `(u, v, reduction)`, indicating which edges should have their bandwidth usage reduced and by how much. You need to minimize the total bandwidth usage of the network such that it is less than or equal to the network's capacity.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Feasibility:** The total bandwidth usage of the network *must* be brought down to at or below `capacity`.
2.  **Minimality of Reduction:**  The total *amount* of bandwidth reduced across all edges should be minimized.  Reducing bandwidth has a negative impact on application performance, so avoid reducing more than necessary.
3.  **Fairness:** Prioritize reducing bandwidth on edges with higher bandwidth usage. This means that if two edges `(u1, v1, w1)` and `(u2, v2, w2)` require reduction, and `w1 > w2`, then `(u1, v1)` should be reduced *before* `(u2, v2)`.  If `w1 == w2`, you can break ties arbitrarily.
4.  **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large networks (up to `N = 10000` nodes and `len(edges) = 100000` edges) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., under 10 seconds).
5.  **Edge Case Considerations:**
    *   The `edges` list might be empty.
    *   The initial total bandwidth usage might already be less than or equal to `capacity`. In this case, return an empty list.
    *   Bandwidth reduction on an edge `(u,v)` must be non-negative and cannot exceed the initial bandwidth `w` of that edge.
6.  **Practical Consideration:** You can only reduce the bandwidth on existing edges; you cannot add new edges or reroute traffic.
7.  **Output Format:** The returned list should contain tuples `(u, v, reduction)` where `u` and `v` are the node IDs of the edge on which bandwidth should be reduced, and `reduction` is the amount (in Mbps) by which the bandwidth usage of that edge should be reduced. The order of edges in this list does not matter. You must reduce the bandwidth of each `(u, v)` pair by the specified amount `reduction`.

**Example:**

```python
N = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 30), (1, 2, 20), (2, 3, 40), (3, 4, 10), (0, 2, 25)]
capacity = 100

# A possible correct output:
# [(2, 3, 5), (0, 2, 0)]
# Explanation: The total bandwidth is 30+20+40+10+25 = 125.
# We need to reduce it by 25.
# The function returns a list of edges and how much to reduce the bandwidth.
# The total amount reduced must equal at least 25. In this case 5+20 = 25.
# It is allowed to reduce bandwidth by 0.
```
Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions about the problem statement.

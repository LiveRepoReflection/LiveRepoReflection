Okay, here's a challenging problem description, designed to be difficult and require careful consideration of algorithmic efficiency and data structures.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Ordering in a Sharded Database

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient transaction ordering system for a sharded database. The database consists of `N` shards, numbered from 0 to `N-1`. Transactions arrive at a central coordinator which must then distribute them to the appropriate shards for execution. Transactions can involve multiple shards, and the order in which transactions are executed across different shards is critical for maintaining data consistency.

Each transaction is defined by the following:

*   `id`: A unique integer identifier for the transaction.
*   `shards`: A list of integers representing the shards involved in the transaction. Shard IDs are between 0 and N-1 inclusive.
*   `dependencies`: A list of transaction IDs that must be completed *before* this transaction can be executed on *any* of its shards. Dependencies are defined across the entire system, not just within individual shards.

The coordinator receives a stream of transactions. Your system must process these transactions and output a valid execution order for each shard. A valid execution order satisfies the following constraints:

1.  **Dependency Constraint:** For each transaction, all of its dependencies must be executed on *all* relevant shards *before* the transaction itself is executed on *any* of its shards.
2.  **Shard Constraint:** The execution order for each shard must be a valid sequence of transaction IDs that involve that shard.
3.  **Global Consistency:** The solution should produce a single, globally consistent execution order considering all shards and transaction dependencies.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as a list of transactions. Each transaction is represented as a dictionary with the following keys: `id`, `shards`, and `dependencies`.
`N` will be provided as the number of shards.

**Output:**

Your solution should return a dictionary where the keys are shard IDs (integers from 0 to `N-1`) and the values are lists of transaction IDs representing the execution order for each shard. If no valid execution order exists (due to circular dependencies or other conflicts), your solution should return `None`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100` (Number of shards)
*   `1 <= Number of Transactions <= 1000`
*   `1 <= Number of shards a transaction involves <= N`
*   Transaction IDs are unique and positive integers.
*   Dependencies can exist between any pair of transactions.
*   The input is guaranteed to have valid transaction dictionaries.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should aim to minimize the latency of transaction execution. While a fully optimized scheduler is not required, the solution should avoid unnecessary delays and strive for a reasonable execution order.
*   Consider optimizing for parallel execution where possible. Can transactions that don't depend on each other be executed concurrently on different shards?

**Example:**

```python
N = 3
transactions = [
    {"id": 1, "shards": [0, 1], "dependencies": []},
    {"id": 2, "shards": [1, 2], "dependencies": [1]},
    {"id": 3, "shards": [0, 2], "dependencies": [2]},
    {"id": 4, "shards": [0], "dependencies": []}
]
```

A possible valid output (execution order) would be:

```python
{
    0: [1, 4, 3],
    1: [1, 2],
    2: [2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Example:**

*   Transaction 1 has no dependencies and involves shards 0 and 1, so it can be executed first on those shards.
*   Transaction 4 has no dependencies and involves shard 0, so it can be executed first on that shard after Transaction 1.
*   Transaction 2 depends on Transaction 1 and involves shards 1 and 2, so it must be executed after Transaction 1 on those shards.
*   Transaction 3 depends on Transaction 2 and involves shards 0 and 2, so it must be executed after Transaction 2 on those shards.

**Key Challenges:**

*   Handling dependencies across multiple shards.
*   Detecting and handling circular dependencies.
*   Finding an efficient execution order.
*   Scalability to a reasonable number of shards and transactions.

This problem requires a combination of topological sorting, graph algorithms, and careful consideration of data structures to manage dependencies and shard assignments. Good luck!

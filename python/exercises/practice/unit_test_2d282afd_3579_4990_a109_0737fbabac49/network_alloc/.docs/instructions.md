Okay, here's a challenging problem description, focusing on algorithmic complexity and optimization, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

**Problem Title:** Network Flow Allocation with Dynamic Capacity Adjustment

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a network infrastructure to handle data flow between various servers in a data center. The network is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent servers and edges represent network links. Each link has an initial maximum capacity for data flow, expressed as an integer.

You are given a set of data transfer requests. Each request specifies a source server, a destination server, and the amount of data that needs to be transferred. Your task is to determine the maximum number of requests that can be fully satisfied, subject to the capacity constraints of the network links.

However, the catch is that the network links are not static. Due to thermal management considerations, after processing each request, the capacity of *all* links in the network is reduced by a fixed percentage `p` (0 < `p` < 100). This reduction is applied cumulatively after each request is processed. If a link's capacity drops below 0, it effectively disappears (i.e., has a capacity of 0).

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can have up to 1000 nodes and 5000 edges.
*   The initial capacity of each link is between 1 and 10<sup>9</sup> (inclusive).
*   The number of data transfer requests can be up to 1000.
*   The amount of data required for each transfer request is between 1 and 10<sup>9</sup> (inclusive).
*   The percentage reduction `p` is between 0.01 and 10 (inclusive).
*   All server IDs will be non-negative integers.
*   Multiple edges between two nodes are allowed (treat them as separate links with their own capacity).
*   Self-loops are allowed.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

1.  The first line contains four integers: `N` (number of nodes), `E` (number of edges), `R` (number of requests), and `p` (percentage reduction).
2.  The next `E` lines each contain three integers: `u`, `v`, `c`, representing a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with initial capacity `c`.
3.  The next `R` lines each contain three integers: `s`, `d`, `a`, representing a data transfer request from source node `s` to destination node `d` with amount `a`.

**Output:**

Output a single integer: the maximum number of data transfer requests that can be fully satisfied, processing them in the order given.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
4 5 3 1.0
0 1 10
0 2 5
1 3 7
2 3 12
1 2 4
0 3 4
0 3 6
1 3 5
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation of Example:**

1.  **Initial Network:**

    *   0 -> 1 (capacity 10)
    *   0 -> 2 (capacity 5)
    *   1 -> 3 (capacity 7)
    *   2 -> 3 (capacity 12)
    *   1 -> 2 (capacity 4)
2.  **Request 1 (0 -> 3, amount 4):**
    *   A possible flow path is 0 -> 1 -> 3 (amount 4).
    *   The capacity along this path is limited by the edges 0 -> 1 (10) and 1 -> 3 (7).
    *   We send 4 units of flow.  Capacities become: 0->1: 6, 1->3: 3.
    *   After processing, all edge capacities are reduced by 1%.
        *   0 -> 1: 6 * 0.99 = 5.94
        *   0 -> 2: 5 * 0.99 = 4.95
        *   1 -> 3: 3 * 0.99 = 2.97
        *   2 -> 3: 12 * 0.99 = 11.88
        *   1 -> 2: 4 * 0.99 = 3.96

3.  **Request 2 (0 -> 3, amount 6):**
    *   A possible flow path is 0 -> 2 -> 3.
    *   The capacity along this path is limited by the edges 0 -> 2 (4.95) and 2 -> 3 (11.88).
    *   We can send 4.95 units of flow (limited by 0->2). The request is not fully satisfied.
    *   Since the problem asks for *fully* satisfied requests, we can't fulfill this request.

    Alternative path : 0 -> 1 -> 3, limited by 0->1(5.94) and 1->3(2.97)
    *   We can send 2.97 units of flow (limited by 1->3). The request is not fully satisfied.
    *   Since the problem asks for *fully* satisfied requests, we can't fulfill this request.

4.  **Request 3 (1 -> 3, amount 5):**
    *   The only path is 1 -> 3, which has capacity 2.97.
    *   We can't satisfy this request fully.

Therefore, only the first request can be fully satisfied. Hence the output is `1`.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the output.
*   Efficiency of the solution. Solutions exceeding the time limit will be rejected. Efficient graph traversal and optimization are critical.  Consider the time complexity carefully. Solutions that are closer to O(requests * (E + V) * flow) may not pass the time constraints.
*   Handling of floating-point precision, especially with cumulative percentage reduction.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using appropriate data structures for the graph representation (e.g., adjacency list).
*   Think about algorithms for finding maximum flow in a graph.
*   Pay close attention to the precision issues with floating-point arithmetic when applying the capacity reduction.  Consider if there are ways to mitigate these issues (e.g., working with integers and scaling appropriately or using an epsilon value for comparisons).
*   Focus on optimizing the flow-finding process for each request, as this will be executed many times.  You may not need to recalculate the *entire* maximum flow from scratch for *every* request.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, careful handling of floating-point numbers, and optimization techniques to achieve an efficient solution. Good luck!

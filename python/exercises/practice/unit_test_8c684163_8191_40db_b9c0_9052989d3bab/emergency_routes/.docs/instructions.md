## Question: Optimal Emergency Route Planning

**Description:**

Imagine you are developing a real-time emergency response system for a large city. The city is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent key locations (e.g., hospitals, fire stations, police stations, major intersections), and edges represent roads connecting these locations. Each road has a travel time associated with it, which can vary depending on the time of day due to traffic conditions.

Given a set of emergency events occurring simultaneously at different locations in the city, your task is to design an algorithm to determine the optimal routes for emergency vehicles to reach each event location from the nearest available emergency service provider (hospital, fire station, or police station).

**Input:**

*   `city_graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph of the city. The keys are location IDs (integers), and the values are dictionaries.  Each inner dictionary represents the outgoing edges from that location. The keys of the inner dictionary are destination location IDs (integers), and the values are dictionaries containing time-dependent travel times. The time-dependent travel times are represented as a list of tuples `[(time1, time2, travel_time), ...]`, indicating that between `time1` and `time2` (inclusive), the travel time on that road is `travel_time`.  Times are represented as integers (e.g., seconds since midnight). The list of tuples is sorted by `time1`.
    *   Example: `city_graph = {0: {1: [(0, 3600, 10), (3601, 7200, 20)], 2: [(0, 86400, 15)]}, 1: {3: [(0, 86400, 5)]}, 2: {3: [(0, 86400, 10)]}, 3: {}}`

*   `emergency_events`: A list of tuples `[(location_id, event_time), ...]`, where `location_id` is the location of the emergency and `event_time` is the time the event occurred (integer).

*   `service_providers`: A dictionary where keys are service provider types (strings like "hospital", "fire_station", "police_station") and values are lists of location IDs where that type of service provider is located.
    *   Example: `service_providers = {"hospital": [0, 1], "fire_station": [2]}`

**Output:**

A dictionary where the keys are `location_id` of the emergency events and the values are dictionaries. Each value-dictionary contains the following keys:

*   `route`: A list of location IDs representing the optimal path from the nearest service provider to the event location (including the start and end locations).
*   `arrival_time`: The estimated time of arrival of the emergency vehicle at the event location (integer).
*   `service_provider_type`: The type of the service provider used (string).
*   `service_provider_location`: The location ID of the service provider used (integer).

If no route can be found to a specific event, return `None` as the value for that event's `location_id`.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 10,000 nodes and 100,000 edges).
*   The number of emergency events can be significant (up to 1,000 events).
*   The travel times on roads are time-dependent, and the optimal route may change depending on the time of day.
*   You need to find the *nearest* service provider *considering travel time*.
*   Your solution must be efficient and have a time complexity suitable for real-time applications (ideally better than O(E * V * K) where E is the number of edges, V the number of vertices and K the number of emergency events).
*   If multiple service providers of the same type are equally nearest to an event, choose the one with the smallest location ID. If service providers of different types are equally nearest, prioritize them in the order: "hospital", "fire_station", "police_station".
*   Assume that the emergency vehicle starts its journey *immediately* at the `event_time`.
*   Assume the city graph is weakly connected, meaning that there is a path between any two nodes if the direction of the edges is ignored.
*   All location IDs are non-negative integers.
*   `event_time` is always non-negative.
*   The `time1` and `time2` values in the travel time tuples are always non-negative integers, and `time1 <= time2`.

**Example:**

```python
city_graph = {
    0: {1: [(0, 3600, 10), (3601, 7200, 20)], 2: [(0, 86400, 15)]},
    1: {3: [(0, 86400, 5)]},
    2: {3: [(0, 86400, 10)]},
    3: {}
}

emergency_events = [(3, 3000)]  # Event at location 3 at time 3000

service_providers = {"hospital": [0, 1], "fire_station": [2]}

# Expected output (Illustrative - actual values depend on your algorithm):
# {
#     3: {
#         "route": [1, 3],
#         "arrival_time": 3005,
#         "service_provider_type": "hospital",
#         "service_provider_location": 1
#     }
# }
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Your solution must accurately determine the optimal routes for all emergency events.
*   **Efficiency:** Your solution must be able to handle large graphs and a significant number of events within a reasonable time limit.
*   **Clarity:** Your code should be well-structured and easy to understand.
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** Your solution must gracefully handle cases where no route can be found or where multiple optimal routes exist.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

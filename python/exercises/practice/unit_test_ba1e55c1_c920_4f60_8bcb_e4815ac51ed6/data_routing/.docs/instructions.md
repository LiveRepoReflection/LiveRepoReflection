## Question: Optimized Data Stream Routing

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a high-throughput data routing system for a global network of sensors. These sensors continuously generate data streams that must be routed to appropriate processing centers based on complex, dynamically changing routing rules.

The sensor network consists of `N` sensors, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`.  Each sensor generates data at a rate of `R` data points per second.

There are `M` processing centers, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `M-1`.

The routing rules are defined as a set of conditions. Each condition specifies which sensors should have their data routed to which processing centers. These conditions are not static; they are updated frequently (potentially every few seconds) based on various factors like network congestion, processing center load, and application requirements.

A single routing rule condition is represented as a tuple: `(sensor_id_set, processing_center_id_set)`. This indicates that data from *any* sensor in `sensor_id_set` should be routed to *all* processing centers in `processing_center_id_set`. A sensor can be a member of multiple `sensor_id_set` and the same goes for processing centers. A sensor's data may need to be routed to multiple processing centers.

The system must be able to handle a large number of sensors and processing centers (up to 10^5 each) and a high data throughput. Furthermore, the routing decision for each data point must be made quickly to avoid bottlenecks. Given the dynamic nature of the routing rules, the data structure and algorithm used to determine the routing paths must be efficiently updatable.

**Your Task:**

Implement a system that can efficiently:

1.  **Update Routing Rules:** Given a list of routing conditions, update the internal data structures to reflect the new routing configuration.
2.  **Route Data:** Given a sensor ID, determine the set of processing center IDs to which the data from that sensor should be routed.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of sensors.
*   `M`: The number of processing centers.
*   `routing_rules`: A list of tuples, where each tuple is a routing condition `(sensor_id_set, processing_center_id_set)`. `sensor_id_set` and `processing_center_id_set` are sets of integers.
*   `sensor_id`: The ID of a sensor for which to determine the routing path (an integer between `0` and `N-1`).

**Output:**

*   A set of integers representing the processing center IDs to which the data from the given `sensor_id` should be routed.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= M <= 10^5`
*   The number of routing rules can be up to `10^4`.
*   The size of `sensor_id_set` and `processing_center_id_set` in each routing rule can be up to `N` and `M` respectively.
*   The `update_routing_rules` operation must be efficient, aiming for a time complexity significantly less than O(N\*M)
*   The `route_data` operation must also be highly efficient, aiming for a time complexity significantly less than O(M).
*   Assume that the input `routing_rules` is always valid, i.e., sensor IDs are within the range \[0, N-1] and processing center IDs are within the range \[0, M-1].

**Example:**

```
N = 5  # 5 sensors
M = 3  # 3 processing centers
routing_rules = [
    ({0, 1}, {0}),  # Data from sensors 0 and 1 should go to processing center 0
    ({1, 2, 3}, {1, 2}),  # Data from sensors 1, 2, and 3 should go to processing centers 1 and 2
]
sensor_id = 1

Output: {0, 1, 2} # Data from sensor 1 should go to processing centers 0, 1, and 2
```

**Emphasis:**

The key challenge lies in designing a data structure and algorithm that allows for efficient updates of the routing rules and rapid determination of the routing path for a given sensor, even with a large number of sensors, processing centers, and dynamically changing rules.  Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and computational complexity when choosing your approach. The system should be scalable and performant under high data throughput.

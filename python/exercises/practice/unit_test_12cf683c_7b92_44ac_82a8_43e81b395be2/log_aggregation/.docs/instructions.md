## Question: Scalable Distributed Log Aggregation

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable system for aggregating logs from a distributed network of servers. Imagine a massive cluster where applications are constantly generating log data. These logs need to be collected, processed, and made available for analysis in near real-time.

Specifically, you need to implement a `LogAggregator` class with the following functionalities:

1.  **Log Ingestion:** The system should be able to ingest logs from multiple sources concurrently. Each log entry consists of a timestamp (unix epoch milliseconds), a server ID (string), and a log message (string).

2.  **Hierarchical Aggregation:** To handle the high volume of logs, the system should implement a hierarchical aggregation strategy. Servers are grouped into regions. Logs are first aggregated at the server level (within each server), then aggregated at the region level (aggregating the aggregated logs from servers within the region), and finally aggregated at the global level. Implement a mechanism to aggregate logs for a given server ID, region, and globally.

3.  **Real-Time Queries:** The system should support real-time queries for logs within a specified time range. The queries can be performed at the server level, region level, or global level. When querying, the system should return a sorted list of log messages (based on timestamp) within the specified time range.

4.  **Scalability & Efficiency:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of servers, regions, and a high volume of log data. Consider the time and space complexity of your solution. The system should be able to process millions of log entries per second.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** Assume that servers can fail. The system should be able to handle server failures gracefully without losing log data. Design a mechanism for data replication or redundancy.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of servers can be up to 100,000.
*   The number of regions can be up to 1,000.
*   Log volume can reach millions of entries per second.
*   Query latency should be minimized (target: < 100ms for most queries).
*   Memory usage should be optimized to avoid out-of-memory errors.

**Input:**

*   Log entries will be provided as a stream of tuples: `(timestamp, server_id, log_message)`.
*   Queries will be provided as tuples: `(query_type, identifier, start_time, end_time)`. `query_type` can be "server", "region", or "global". `identifier` will be the server ID (string) for "server" queries, the region ID (string) for "region" queries, or None for "global" queries. `start_time` and `end_time` are unix epoch milliseconds.

**Output:**

*   For each query, return a list of log messages (strings) sorted by timestamp within the specified time range.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about appropriate data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of log data. Consider using in-memory data structures with persistence mechanisms.
*   Consider the use of concurrency and parallelism to handle the high volume of log data.
*   Implement appropriate caching mechanisms to improve query performance.
*   Design a robust fault tolerance mechanism to handle server failures.
*   Pay attention to code readability and maintainability.

This is a challenging problem that requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, system design, and concurrency. Good luck!

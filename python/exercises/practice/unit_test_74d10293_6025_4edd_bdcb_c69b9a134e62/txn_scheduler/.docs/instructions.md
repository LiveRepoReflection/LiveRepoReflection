Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test algorithmic skills, data structure knowledge, and optimization techniques.

## Question: Optimized Distributed Transaction Scheduler

### Question Description

You are building a distributed database system that supports ACID transactions. A crucial component of this system is the **global transaction scheduler**. This scheduler is responsible for receiving transaction requests from various client applications, coordinating the execution of these transactions across multiple database shards (nodes), and ensuring serializability to maintain data consistency.

Each transaction consists of a series of operations (read or write) that need to be performed on specific data items (keys) located on different shards. The scheduler needs to determine an optimal execution order for these transactions to minimize latency while guaranteeing correctness.

**Specifically, you need to implement a function `schedule_transactions(transactions, shard_map)` that takes a list of transaction requests and a shard map as input and returns a schedule that minimizes overall transaction completion time.**

**Input:**

*   `transactions`: A list of `Transaction` objects. Each `Transaction` object has the following attributes:
    *   `id`: A unique integer representing the transaction ID.
    *   `operations`: A list of `Operation` objects. Each `Operation` object has the following attributes:
        *   `type`: A string, either `"READ"` or `"WRITE"`.
        *   `key`: A string representing the data item (key) being accessed.
        *   `shard_id`: An integer representing the shard on which the operation needs to be executed.
        *   `estimated_duration`: An integer representing the estimated time (in milliseconds) it takes to complete the operation on the shard.
        *   `transaction_id`: The ID of the transaction to which the operation belongs.
*   `shard_map`: A dictionary where keys are shard IDs (integers) and values are `Shard` objects. Each `Shard` object represents a database shard and has the following attribute:
    *   `processing_capacity`: An integer representing the maximum number of operations that can be executed concurrently on that shard. Assume each operation uses one unit of processing capacity.

**Output:**

A list of tuples `(timestamp, transaction_id, shard_id)`, representing the scheduled execution of transactions. The list should be sorted by timestamp. The `timestamp` indicates the start time (in milliseconds) of the transaction on the given shard.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Serializability:** The schedule must be serializable. This means there should be no cycles in the precedence graph (conflicts between transactions accessing the same data items). You need to detect and prevent such cycles.
2.  **Shard Capacity:** The number of concurrent operations running on each shard at any given time cannot exceed the shard's `processing_capacity`.
3.  **Transaction Dependencies:** All operations within a transaction must be executed in the order they appear in the `operations` list.
4.  **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the makespan, which is the time when the last transaction completes.
5.  **Deadlock Prevention:** Your solution must prevent deadlocks.
6.  **Scalability:** The solution should be able to handle a large number of transactions and shards (e.g., hundreds of transactions and dozens of shards).
7.  **Complex Conflicts:** The transactions can have complex read-write and write-write conflicts across multiple shards.
8.  **Dynamic Scheduling:** You need to schedule the transactions dynamically, taking into account the current state of the shards (i.e., the operations that are currently running).
9.  **Precedence Graph:** You must build a precedence graph to detect cycles and enforce serializability. You can use any suitable data structure (e.g., adjacency list) to represent the graph.
10. **Transaction Aborts:** If a cycle is detected in the precedence graph, you need to abort one or more transactions involved in the cycle to break the cycle. You can choose to abort the transaction with the least number of operations or the transaction that is most recently added to the schedule.

**Example:**

```python
# Simplified example - actual objects would be more complex
transactions = [
    Transaction(id=1, operations=[Operation(type="WRITE", key="A", shard_id=1, estimated_duration=10, transaction_id=1), Operation(type="READ", key="B", shard_id=2, estimated_duration=5, transaction_id=1)]),
    Transaction(id=2, operations=[Operation(type="WRITE", key="B", shard_id=2, estimated_duration=15, transaction_id=2), Operation(type="READ", key="A", shard_id=1, estimated_duration=8, transaction_id=2)])
]
shard_map = {
    1: Shard(processing_capacity=2),
    2: Shard(processing_capacity=1)
}

schedule = schedule_transactions(transactions, shard_map)
# Possible schedule (timestamps can vary based on your algorithm):
# [(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 2), (10, 1, 2), (15, 2, 1)] or another valid, optimized schedule
```

**Classes:**

```python
class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, id, operations):
        self.id = id
        self.operations = operations

class Operation:
    def __init__(self, type, key, shard_id, estimated_duration, transaction_id):
        self.type = type
        self.key = key
        self.shard_id = shard_id
        self.estimated_duration = estimated_duration
        self.transaction_id = transaction_id

class Shard:
    def __init__(self, processing_capacity):
        self.processing_capacity = processing_capacity
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The generated schedule must be serializable and adhere to shard capacity constraints.
*   **Optimality:** The solution should minimize the makespan.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be able to handle a large number of transactions and shards.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be computationally efficient.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.

Good luck! This problem requires a deep understanding of transaction scheduling, concurrency control, and distributed systems principles. You'll likely need to combine several algorithms and data structures to arrive at an effective solution.

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations:

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Consensus

### Question Description

You are building a distributed key-value store. To ensure data consistency across multiple nodes, you need to implement a distributed transaction mechanism using a simplified version of the Raft consensus algorithm.

Your system consists of `N` nodes (where `N` is an odd number, guaranteed to be at least 3), each with a unique ID from `0` to `N-1`. Each node stores a partial copy of the key-value store.

**Simplified Raft Implementation:**

1.  **Leader Election:** Initially, any node can propose itself as a leader. If multiple nodes propose themselves simultaneously, the node with the *lowest* ID wins the election. (This is a simplification for the problem). The first node that propose itself will always win the election at time 0.
2.  **Transaction Proposal:** The leader receives transaction requests (key-value pair updates).
3.  **Log Replication:** The leader appends the transaction to its log and sends it to all other nodes (followers).
4.  **Acknowledgement:** Followers, upon receiving a log entry, append it to their own log and send an acknowledgment (ACK) back to the leader.
5.  **Commit:** Once the leader receives ACKs from a *majority* (more than half) of the nodes (including itself), the leader commits the transaction. The leader then informs all followers to commit the transaction.
6.  **Apply:** Upon receiving the commit signal from the leader, followers apply the transaction to their local key-value store.

**Your Task:**

Implement a `TransactionSimulator` class that simulates this distributed transaction process.

The class should have the following methods:

*   `__init__(self, num_nodes: int)`: Initializes the simulator with `num_nodes` nodes. Each node has an empty key-value store (a dictionary) and an empty log (a list). Each node is also initialized with the leader ID.
*   `propose_transaction(self, leader_id: int, key: str, value: str) -> bool`: Simulates a transaction proposal initiated by the node with `leader_id`.  The `key` and `value` are strings. The function should return `True` if the transaction is successfully committed and applied on a majority of nodes, and `False` otherwise (e.g., if the leader is not the node with the lowest ID, or if not enough ACKs are received within a reasonable simulated time).
*   `get_node_data(self, node_id: int) -> dict`: Returns the key-value store of the node with `node_id`.
*   `get_node_log(self, node_id: int) -> list`: Returns the log of the node with `node_id`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Number of Nodes (N):** 3 <= N <= 11 (N is always odd).
*   **Simulated Time:** You should implement some form of simulated time or iteration limit to prevent infinite loops when waiting for ACKs.  A reasonable limit is 10 iterations for the acknowledgement and commit process.
*   **Leader Election Tiebreaker:** The node with the *lowest* ID is always the leader. If a node with a higher ID proposes a transaction, it should fail.
*   **Majority:** A majority requires ACKs from strictly more than half the nodes.
*   **Data Structure Consistency:** After a successful transaction, the committed key-value pair should exist in the key-value store of a majority of nodes.
*   **Log Consistency:** The logs of a majority of nodes should contain the transaction, even if the transaction fails. The content of logs must be the same among all nodes.
*   **Acknowledgement Simulation:** You don't need to simulate actual network communication.  Simply assume that ACKs are received immediately if a follower receives a log entry.
*   **Commit Simulation:**  Assume followers commit the transaction immediately upon receiving the commit signal.
*   **No External Libraries:** You are allowed to use built-in Python data structures and functions but not any external libraries (e.g., `threading`, `asyncio`, `networkx`).  This is to focus on the core Raft logic.
*   **Efficiency:** While full-blown optimization isn't required, avoid obviously inefficient approaches (e.g., repeatedly iterating through all nodes when a more efficient lookup is possible).

**Example:**

```python
simulator = TransactionSimulator(5)
success = simulator.propose_transaction(0, "x", "1")  # Node 0 is the leader
print(success)  # Output: True

data_0 = simulator.get_node_data(0)
print(data_0)  # Output: {'x': '1'}

data_1 = simulator.get_node_data(1)
print(data_1) # Output: {'x': '1'}

data_2 = simulator.get_node_data(2)
print(data_2) # Output: {'x': '1'}

data_3 = simulator.get_node_data(3)
print(data_3) # Output: {'x': '1'}

data_4 = simulator.get_node_data(4)
print(data_4) # Output: {'x': '1'}

log_0 = simulator.get_node_log(0)
print(log_0)  # Output: [{'key': 'x', 'value': '1'}]

log_1 = simulator.get_node_log(1)
print(log_1)  # Output: [{'key': 'x', 'value': '1'}]

success = simulator.propose_transaction(1, "y", "2")  # Node 1 is NOT the leader
print(success) # Output: False

print(simulator.get_node_data(1)) # Output: {'x': '1'}

print(simulator.get_node_log(1))  # Output: [{'key': 'x', 'value': '1'}, {'key': 'y', '2'}]
```

This problem challenges the candidate to:

*   Model a distributed system.
*   Implement a simplified consensus algorithm.
*   Handle edge cases related to leader election and majority.
*   Consider data and log consistency across multiple nodes.
*   Think about efficiency and time limits in a distributed environment.

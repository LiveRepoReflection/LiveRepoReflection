## Problem: Optimal Train Network Design

**Description:**

A major railway company is planning to build a new high-speed train network connecting several cities. The company has conducted a feasibility study and has identified potential routes (edges) between cities (nodes), along with the estimated construction cost and expected passenger volume for each route.

The goal is to design a train network that connects all the cities while minimizing the total construction cost, but also maximizes the overall profit derived from passenger traffic. Due to limited resources, the company has a strict budget constraint.

**Specifics:**

*   **Input:**
    *   `n`: The number of cities (numbered from 0 to n-1).
    *   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a potential train route: `(city1, city2, cost, passenger_volume)`.
    *   `budget`: The maximum total cost allowed for the network construction.
    *   `revenue_per_passenger`: The revenue generated per passenger on any given route.

*   **Output:** The maximum possible total revenue that can be generated by a train network that connects all cities without exceeding the budget. If it's impossible to connect all cities within the given budget, return `-1`.

*   **Constraints:**
    *   `1 <= n <= 500`
    *   `0 <= len(edges) <= n * (n - 1) / 2`  (No duplicate edges)
    *   `0 <= city1, city2 < n`
    *   `city1 != city2`
    *   `1 <= cost <= 10^6`
    *   `1 <= passenger_volume <= 10^6`
    *   `1 <= budget <= 10^9`
    *   `1 <= revenue_per_passenger <= 10`

*   **Efficiency Requirements:**
    *   The solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).

*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   The input graph might not be fully connected. If it's impossible to connect all cities, return `-1`.
    *   The network can be a single path, a tree, or any other connected graph.
    *   Passenger volumes are directional and additive. For example, if there's an edge (A, B, cost, passenger_volume), the revenue is derived only from passengers traveling from A to B.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
*   Efficiency: The solution should be optimized for performance and should handle large inputs within the time limit.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

Good luck!

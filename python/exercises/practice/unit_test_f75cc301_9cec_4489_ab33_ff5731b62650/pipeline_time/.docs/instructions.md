## Question: Parallel Data Processing Pipeline with Dependency Resolution

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a parallel data processing pipeline. This pipeline consists of a series of processing stages, each represented by a task. Tasks have dependencies on other tasks, meaning a task can only start processing once all its dependencies have completed. The goal is to efficiently execute all tasks in parallel, respecting the dependencies, and minimizing the overall execution time.

Specifically, you are given:

1.  A list of `tasks`. Each `task` is represented by a unique integer ID.
2.  A dictionary `dependencies`, where the `keys` are task IDs and the `values` are lists of task IDs that the key task depends on. For example, `dependencies = {1: [2, 3], 2: [], 3: [2]}` means task 1 depends on tasks 2 and 3, task 2 has no dependencies, and task 3 depends on task 2.
3.  A dictionary `processing_times`, where the `keys` are task IDs and the `values` are the processing time for that task (in arbitrary time units). For example, `processing_times = {1: 5, 2: 3, 3: 2}` means task 1 takes 5 units of time, task 2 takes 3 units of time, and task 3 takes 2 units of time.
4.  A fixed number `num_workers` representing the number of parallel workers available to execute the tasks. Only one task can run on the worker at the same time.

Your task is to write a function that calculates the **minimum total time** required to execute all tasks, considering the dependencies, processing times, and the number of available workers.

**Constraints:**

*   The input data (tasks, dependencies, processing\_times) can be very large (up to 10^5 tasks).
*   The dependency graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This means there are no circular dependencies.
*   The processing times are positive integers.
*   The number of workers is a positive integer.

**Requirements:**

*   The solution must be highly optimized for performance. Inefficient solutions may time out.
*   The solution should correctly handle various edge cases, such as tasks with no dependencies, tasks with long chains of dependencies, and scenarios where the number of workers is significantly smaller or larger than the number of tasks.
*   The solution should ensure that tasks are executed in parallel as much as possible while respecting dependencies and worker availability.
*   The function should return the minimum total time as an integer.

## Question: Optimal Traffic Light Scheduling

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal traffic light scheduling algorithm for a complex road network in a smart city. The road network is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments connecting them. Each road segment has a capacity, representing the maximum number of vehicles it can hold.

The goal is to minimize the average waiting time of vehicles in the entire network. Each intersection has a set of traffic lights, each controlling the flow of traffic along one or more incoming road segments. At any given time, only one traffic light at an intersection can be green, allowing vehicles to pass through. All other lights at the intersection are red, forcing vehicles to wait.

You are given the following inputs:

*   **`num_intersections`**: An integer representing the number of intersections in the road network. Intersections are numbered from 0 to `num_intersections - 1`.
*   **`road_segments`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, capacity)` represents a directed road segment from intersection `u` to intersection `v` with a capacity of `capacity`.
*   **`traffic_lights`**: A dictionary where the key is the intersection ID and the value is a list of lists. Each inner list represents a traffic light configuration. Each traffic light configuration contains the road segments (represented by tuples `(u,v)`) that this traffic light controls. When the traffic light is green, traffic can flow from `u` to `v`.
*   **`vehicle_arrival_rates`**: A dictionary where the key is a road segment represented by a tuple `(u, v)` and the value is the average number of vehicles arriving at that road segment per second.
*   **`time_horizon`**: The simulation time for which to optimize the traffic light schedule (in seconds).
*   **`switch_time`**: The minimum time (in seconds) a traffic light must remain green before switching to another light at the same intersection. This represents the time it takes for vehicles to react and clear the intersection.

**Your task is to write a function `optimize_traffic_lights(num_intersections, road_segments, traffic_lights, vehicle_arrival_rates, time_horizon, switch_time)` that returns a schedule for each intersection.**

The schedule should be a dictionary where the key is the intersection ID and the value is a list of integers, representing the sequence of traffic light indices to be activated at that intersection. Each integer in the list corresponds to the index of the traffic light configuration in the `traffic_lights` dictionary for that intersection.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be efficient, minimizing the average waiting time of vehicles in the network over the `time_horizon`.
*   The `switch_time` constraint must be strictly enforced.
*   The capacity of each road segment must not be exceeded at any time.  Vehicles exceeding capacity are considered to be blocked and their waiting time is heavily penalized.
*   You can assume the road network is connected, and there is at least one path between any two intersections.
*   The number of intersections, road segments, and traffic light configurations can be large (up to 100 intersections, 500 road segments, and 5 traffic lights per intersection).
*   The average vehicle arrival rates are small (less than 1 vehicle per second per road segment), but the cumulative effect over the `time_horizon` is significant.
*   You are allowed to use any standard Python libraries.
*   You are expected to provide a reasonable, but not necessarily globally optimal, solution within a reasonable time frame (e.g., a few minutes).

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the average waiting time of vehicles in the network over the `time_horizon`, as determined by a simulation. The simulation will take into account the road segment capacities, vehicle arrival rates, traffic light schedules, and the `switch_time` constraint.  Solutions with significantly lower average waiting times will be considered better. Solutions that violate constraints (e.g., exceeding road capacity, violating `switch_time`) will receive a large penalty.

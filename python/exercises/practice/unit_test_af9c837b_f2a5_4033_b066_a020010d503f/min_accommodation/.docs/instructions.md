## Question: Minimum Cost Accommodation Planner

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an accommodation planning system for a large-scale conference. The conference spans multiple days, and attendees need accommodation. Different hotels in the city have varying prices and capacities for each day of the conference.

Specifically, you are given the following information:

*   **`num_attendees`**: The total number of attendees who require accommodation for the entire duration of the conference.
*   **`num_days`**: The number of days the conference lasts.
*   **`hotels`**: A list of hotels. Each hotel is represented by a dictionary containing:
    *   **`id`**: A unique identifier for the hotel (integer).
    *   **`daily_capacities`**: A list of integers representing the number of attendees the hotel can accommodate on each day. The length of this list is equal to `num_days`.
    *   **`daily_rates`**: A list of floats representing the cost per attendee for each day. The length of this list is equal to `num_days`.
    *   **`fixed_cost`**: A fixed cost (float) incurred if any attendee stays at this hotel, regardless of how many attendees or how many days.

Your task is to write a function `min_cost_accommodation(num_attendees, num_days, hotels)` that returns the **minimum total cost** to accommodate all attendees for the entire duration of the conference.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   Every attendee must be accommodated for all `num_days`.
*   An attendee can only stay at one hotel for the entire duration of the conference. You cannot split an attendee's stay across multiple hotels or days.
*   The total number of attendees staying at a hotel on any given day cannot exceed the hotel's capacity for that day.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient, especially for a large number of attendees, hotels, and conference days. Naive brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   You are allowed to use external libraries, such as `numpy`.
*   If it is impossible to accommodate all attendees given the hotel capacities, return `-1`.
*   The `fixed_cost` is incurred *once* per hotel if *any* attendees are assigned to that hotel.

**Input:**

*   `num_attendees` (int): The number of attendees.
*   `num_days` (int): The number of conference days.
*   `hotels` (list of dict): A list of hotel dictionaries, as described above.

**Output:**

*   (float): The minimum total cost to accommodate all attendees. Return `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate all attendees.

**Example:**

```python
num_attendees = 100
num_days = 3
hotels = [
    {
        'id': 1,
        'daily_capacities': [50, 50, 50],
        'daily_rates': [100.0, 100.0, 100.0],
        'fixed_cost': 500.0
    },
    {
        'id': 2,
        'daily_capacities': [60, 60, 60],
        'daily_rates': [90.0, 90.0, 90.0],
        'fixed_cost': 700.0
    }
]

# Expected output (not necessarily the only valid one):
# 100 attendees at hotel 2: (90.0 * 3 * 100) + 700.0 = 27700.0
# min_cost_accommodation(num_attendees, num_days, hotels) == 27700.0
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using dynamic programming or a similar optimization technique.
*   Think about how to pre-calculate certain values to avoid redundant computations.
*   Be careful about integer overflow.
*   Consider edge cases, such as when no hotels are available, or when hotel capacities are very low.
*   The optimal solution might involve using a combination of multiple hotels.

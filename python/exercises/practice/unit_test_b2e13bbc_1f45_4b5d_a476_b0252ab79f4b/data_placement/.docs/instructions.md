Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations.

OptimalNetworkPlacement
```

### Question Description

A large telecommunications company, "ConnectAll," is planning to deploy a high-speed fiber optic network across a vast, sparsely populated region. The region can be represented as a graph where cities are nodes, and potential fiber optic cable routes between cities are edges with associated costs (laying cable is expensive!).

ConnectAll needs to select a subset of cities to host new data centers. Each data center can serve all cities within a certain latency radius (measured in milliseconds, proportional to the path cost in the graph).

**Your Task:**

Write a Python function `find_optimal_data_center_locations(graph, num_data_centers, latency_radius, city_demands)` that determines the optimal placement of data centers to minimize ConnectAll's total cost, while satisfying customer demands.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the network graph. Keys are city names (strings), and values are dictionaries representing neighboring cities and the associated cost (latency in milliseconds) of the connection.  For example:

```python
graph = {
    'CityA': {'CityB': 10, 'CityC': 15},
    'CityB': {'CityA': 10, 'CityD': 20},
    'CityC': {'CityA': 15, 'CityE': 25},
    'CityD': {'CityB': 20, 'CityF': 30},
    'CityE': {'CityC': 25, 'CityF': 35},
    'CityF': {'CityD': 30, 'CityE': 35}
}
```

*   `num_data_centers`: An integer representing the maximum number of data centers ConnectAll can afford to build.

*   `latency_radius`: An integer representing the maximum latency (in milliseconds) a customer can tolerate to a data center.  Any city within this latency radius of a data center is considered "covered."

*   `city_demands`: A dictionary representing the demand for network services in each city. Keys are city names (strings), and values are integers representing the demand (e.g., number of users, bandwidth required).  For example:

```python
city_demands = {
    'CityA': 1000,
    'CityB': 1500,
    'CityC': 800,
    'CityD': 1200,
    'CityE': 900,
    'CityF': 1100
}
```

**Output:**

A tuple containing:

1.  A list of city names (strings) representing the optimal locations for the data centers.  The length of this list must be less than or equal to `num_data_centers`.
2.  The total demand covered by the chosen data center locations.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Coverage:** Each city's demand must be satisfied by at least one data center within the `latency_radius`. If full coverage isn't possible with the given constraints, maximize the total demand covered.
*   **Optimization:** The solution must maximize the total demand covered, given the constraint on the number of data centers.
*   **Efficiency:** The graph can be large (up to 1000 cities). Aim for an efficient algorithm. Naive solutions will likely time out.
*   **Tie-breaking:** If multiple sets of data center locations achieve the same maximum coverage, return any one of them.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the graph is empty, `num_data_centers` is zero, or `latency_radius` is zero.
*   **Negative Latency:** The cable latency can't be negative.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    'CityA': {'CityB': 10, 'CityC': 15},
    'CityB': {'CityA': 10, 'CityD': 20},
    'CityC': {'CityA': 15, 'CityE': 25},
    'CityD': {'CityB': 20, 'CityF': 30},
    'CityE': {'CityC': 25, 'CityF': 35},
    'CityF': {'CityD': 30, 'CityE': 35}
}
num_data_centers = 2
latency_radius = 30
city_demands = {
    'CityA': 1000,
    'CityB': 1500,
    'CityC': 800,
    'CityD': 1200,
    'CityE': 900,
    'CityF': 1100
}

optimal_locations, total_demand_covered = find_optimal_data_center_locations(graph, num_data_centers, latency_radius, city_demands)

print(f"Optimal Data Center Locations: {optimal_locations}")
print(f"Total Demand Covered: {total_demand_covered}")

# Possible Output (the exact output may vary due to tie-breaking):
# Optimal Data Center Locations: ['CityB', 'CityE']
# Total Demand Covered: 6500
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall to compute all-pairs shortest paths.
*   Think about greedy approaches or dynamic programming to select the optimal data center locations.
*   Bitmasking can be useful for representing the set of covered cities.

This problem combines graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and realistic constraints, making it a challenging and sophisticated exercise. Good luck!

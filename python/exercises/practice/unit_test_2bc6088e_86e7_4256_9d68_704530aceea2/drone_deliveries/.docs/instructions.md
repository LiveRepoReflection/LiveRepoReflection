## The Autonomous Delivery Network

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a control system for an autonomous delivery network operating in a densely populated urban environment. The network consists of delivery drones operating out of a central depot. The goal is to efficiently manage drone flights to fulfill delivery requests while minimizing congestion, maximizing throughput, and ensuring safety.

**Input:**

*   A list of `N` delivery requests. Each request is represented as a tuple `(request_id, pickup_location, delivery_location, package_size, priority, deadline)`.
    *   `request_id`: Unique identifier for the delivery request (integer).
    *   `pickup_location`: Coordinates (x, y) of the package's origin (integers).
    *   `delivery_location`: Coordinates (x, y) of the package's destination (integers).
    *   `package_size`: Size of the package (small, medium, large) (string).
    *   `priority`: Integer representing the priority of the request (higher value indicates higher priority).
    *   `deadline`: Unix timestamp representing the deadline for delivery.
*   A 2D grid representing the city map. Each cell in the grid indicates the air space congestion level at that location (integer between 0 and 10, inclusive; 0 means free, 10 means heavily congested). The grid is provided as a list of lists. `city_map[y][x]` represents the congestion at coordinates (x, y).
*   A list of `M` available drones. Each drone is represented by a tuple `(drone_id, current_location, max_payload, speed)`.
    *   `drone_id`: Unique identifier for the drone (integer).
    *   `current_location`: Coordinates (x, y) of the drone's current location (integers).
    *   `max_payload`: Maximum package size the drone can carry (small, medium, large) (string).
    *   `speed`: Speed of the drone (units of distance per unit of time, integer).
*   The central depot's coordinates `(depot_x, depot_y)`.
*   A collision risk factor `risk_factor` (float between 0.0 and 1.0). Higher values mean routes with higher congestion have increased risk of collision.

**Constraints:**

*   The drones must return to the central depot after each delivery.
*   Drones can only carry one package at a time.
*   A drone can only accept a delivery request if its `max_payload` is greater than or equal to the request's `package_size`.
*   The delivery must be completed before the `deadline`.
*   The total travel time for each drone (including return to depot) should be minimized.
*   Avoid high-congestion areas (higher congestion values in the `city_map` increase collision risk)
*   The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated using Manhattan distance: `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)`.
*   The total congestion cost for a path is the sum of congestion levels of all cells on the path multiplied by the path length. The path is created by moving one cell at a time (up, down, left, right). Assume optimal pathfinding.
*   The collision risk for a route is calculated by `risk_factor * (total_congestion_cost / total_path_length)`. Minimize routes where collision risk is above a certain threshold (you can dynamically adjust your routes based on the `risk_factor`).
*   Scale: 1 <= N <= 1000, 1 <= M <= 100, map is at most 100x100.
*   Delivery requests may have conflicting deadlines and priorities.
*   The solution must complete execution within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 60 seconds).

**Output:**

A dictionary where the keys are `drone_id` and the values are lists of `request_id` assigned to that drone, in the order they should be delivered. If a drone is not assigned any deliveries, its entry should still exist with an empty list.

**Example:**

```python
{
    1: [101, 105, 110],  # Drone 1 delivers requests 101, 105, and 110 in that order
    2: [102, 108],      # Drone 2 delivers requests 102 and 108
    3: [],             # Drone 3 is not assigned any deliveries
    ...
}
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  **Throughput:** Number of delivery requests successfully fulfilled.
2.  **Efficiency:** Minimization of total travel time for all drones.
3.  **Priority:** Fulfillment of higher-priority requests.
4.  **Deadline Adherence:** Number of deliveries completed before their deadlines.
5.  **Safety:** Minimization of collision risk (lower congestion routes).
6.  **Scalability:** Performance with a large number of requests and drones.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using heuristics and approximation algorithms to solve this NP-hard problem.
*   Explore different pathfinding algorithms to balance speed and congestion avoidance (e.g., A\* search with a cost function that incorporates congestion).
*   Implement a task assignment strategy to allocate requests to drones efficiently (e.g., Hungarian algorithm, greedy algorithms).
*   Use data structures effectively to manage requests, drones, and the city map.

This problem requires you to integrate your knowledge of data structures, algorithms, optimization techniques, and system design principles to create a robust and efficient delivery network. Good luck!

## Question: Optimal Wireless Network Deployment

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a wireless network for a remote area. The area is represented as a 2D grid. There are `N` potential customer locations within this grid, each represented by its (x, y) coordinates. Your goal is to determine the **minimum number of wireless access points (APs)** needed to provide coverage to all customer locations, and the **optimal locations** for those APs.

Each AP has a fixed coverage radius `R`. A customer location is considered covered if it lies within a distance of `R` from at least one AP. You can place APs anywhere on the grid (not just at customer locations).

However, there are additional constraints due to the terrain:

1.  **Obstacles:** The grid contains `M` obstacle locations, also represented by (x, y) coordinates. APs cannot be placed at obstacle locations.
2.  **Interference:** To minimize interference, APs must be placed at least `D` units apart from each other. This means the Euclidean distance between any two APs must be at least `D`.
3.  **Budget:** Each AP has a cost `C`. You have a maximum budget `B` for deploying the APs. The total cost of the deployed APs must not exceed `B`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: Number of customer locations (1 <= N <= 200)
*   `customer_locations`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a customer location (x, y). (0 <= x, y <= 1000)
*   `M`: Number of obstacle locations (0 <= M <= 50)
*   `obstacle_locations`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents an obstacle location (x, y). (0 <= x, y <= 1000)
*   `R`: Coverage radius of each AP (1 <= R <= 200)
*   `D`: Minimum distance between APs (1 <= D <= 200)
*   `C`: Cost of each AP (1 <= C <= 100)
*   `B`: Total budget for APs (C <= B <= 10000)

**Output:**

*   Return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of an AP.
*   If it is impossible to cover all customer locations within the given constraints, return an empty list `[]`.
*   If multiple solutions exist with the minimum number of APs, return the one that minimizes the total distance between all APs and all customer locations.

**Constraints:**

*   The grid size is implicitly defined by the range of x and y coordinates in `customer_locations` and `obstacle_locations`. Assume a maximum x and y coordinate of 1000.
*   All x and y coordinates are integers.
*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The returned AP locations must cover all customer locations.
*   **Validity:** The APs must not be placed at obstacle locations and must satisfy the minimum distance constraint `D`.
*   **Optimality:** The number of APs must be minimized.  Among solutions with the same minimum number of APs, the solution with the smallest total distance to customer locations is preferred.
*   **Budget:** The total cost of APs must not exceed the budget `B`.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must run within the time limit. Solutions that are correct but inefficient may not pass all test cases.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure usage, and optimization techniques. A brute-force approach is unlikely to succeed due to the large search space. Consider using techniques like greedy algorithms, heuristics, or approximation algorithms to find a near-optimal solution within the time constraints.

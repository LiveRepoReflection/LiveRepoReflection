Okay, here's a challenging programming problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization, and real-world considerations.

## Question: Real-Time Recommendation Engine

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a real-time recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform. The platform has millions of users and products. When a user visits a product page, the system needs to quickly recommend other relevant products. The relevance is determined by user-item interaction history (e.g., purchases, views, "added to cart") and product similarity.

**Input:**

*   A stream of user-product interaction events. Each event contains:
    *   `user_id` (integer): The ID of the user.
    *   `product_id` (integer): The ID of the product.
    *   `event_type` (string): The type of interaction ("view", "cart", "purchase").
    *   `timestamp` (integer): The timestamp of the event (Unix epoch).
*   A product catalog. Each product has:
    *   `product_id` (integer): The ID of the product.
    *   `features` (list of floats): A vector representing the product's features (e.g., price, category embeddings).

**Output:**

*   A function `get_recommendations(user_id, product_id, k)` that, given a `user_id`, a `product_id` (the currently viewed product), and a number `k`, returns a list of `k` recommended `product_id`s, ordered by relevance (most relevant first).

**Constraints:**

*   **Real-time:** The `get_recommendations` function must respond quickly (e.g., within 100ms).
*   **Scalability:** The system must handle millions of users and products.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** The system must adapt to new user-product interactions in real-time.
*   **Memory Limit:** The system must operate within a reasonable memory limit.
*   **Cold Start:** Consider how to handle new users or products with little or no interaction history.
*   `1 <= k <= 100`

**Relevance Metric:**

The relevance of a product `p2` to a user `u` viewing product `p1` should consider:

1.  **User-Item Affinity:** How often has user `u` interacted with products similar to `p2`?  "Purchase" events should have a higher weight than "cart" events, which should have a higher weight than "view" events.
2.  **Product Similarity:** How similar are the features of `p1` and `p2`? Use cosine similarity between the feature vectors.

Combine these two factors to create a relevance score. You can weigh the factors as you see fit.

**Example:**

```python
# Example interaction event
event = {
    "user_id": 123,
    "product_id": 456,
    "event_type": "view",
    "timestamp": 1678886400
}

# Example product catalog entry
product = {
    "product_id": 456,
    "features": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
}

recommendations = get_recommendations(123, 456, 5)  # Returns a list of 5 product_ids
```

**Bonus Considerations:**

*   Implement a mechanism to decay the influence of older interaction events (e.g., using a sliding time window).
*   Consider using techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality.
*   Explore different data structures to optimize the storage and retrieval of user-item interaction data and product features (e.g., inverted indexes, approximate nearest neighbor search).
*   Think about how to handle different types of product features (categorical vs. numerical).

Good luck! This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles to achieve the desired performance and scalability. The best solution will involve a thoughtful balance of accuracy, speed, and memory usage.

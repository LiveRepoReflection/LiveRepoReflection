## Problem: Optimal Train Network Design

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal train network to connect a set of cities. You are given a list of cities, their geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and a budget for constructing the railway lines. The goal is to connect all cities while minimizing the *maximum travel time* between any two cities in the network, subject to the budget constraint.

**Specifics:**

*   **Cities:** Represented as a list of tuples `(city_name, latitude, longitude)`.
*   **Railway Lines:** A railway line can be built directly between any two cities. The cost of a railway line is proportional to the Euclidean distance between the two cities (you can assume a constant cost-per-kilometer).
*   **Budget:** A maximum limit on the total cost of constructing the railway network.
*   **Connectivity:** All cities must be connected, either directly or indirectly through a path of railway lines.
*   **Maximum Travel Time:** The maximum travel time between any two cities in the network needs to be minimized.  Assume a fixed speed for all trains on all railway lines (e.g., 1 km/minute). Thus, the travel time between two cities is directly proportional to the distance between them.
*   **Objective:** Minimize the maximum travel time between any two cities in the connected network while staying within the budget.

**Input:**

*   `cities`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the city name (string), latitude (float), and longitude (float). Example: `[("A", 34.0522, -118.2437), ("B", 37.7749, -122.4194), ("C", 40.7128, -74.0060)]`
*   `budget`: A float representing the maximum allowed cost for constructing the railway network.
*   `cost_per_km`: A float representing the cost per kilometer of railway line.
*   `train_speed`: A float representing the speed of the train in km/minute.

**Output:**

*   A tuple containing:
    *   A list of tuples representing the railway lines to be built. Each tuple contains the names of the two connected cities. Example: `[("A", "B"), ("B", "C")]`
    *   The maximum travel time (in minutes) between any two cities in the designed network.
    *   The total cost of the designed network.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The number of cities can be large (up to 1000).
*   The budget might not be sufficient to build railway lines between every pair of cities.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient. Brute-force approaches will not scale.
*   Consider edge cases where the budget is too small to connect all cities, or where a trivial solution exists (e.g., a complete graph is affordable). In cases where it is impossible to connect all cities, return `([], float('inf'), float('inf'))`. In cases where a trivial solution exists, return that solution.
*   The distance calculation must use the Haversine formula for great-circle distance on a sphere since latitude and longitude are provided.
*   Multiple valid solutions may exist. The goal is to find *a* solution that minimizes the maximum travel time within the budget. There is no need to find a *guaranteed* optimal solution.

**Expected Complexity:**

The problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (minimum spanning tree, shortest path), optimization techniques, and careful consideration of trade-offs. Efficient implementations are crucial for handling large datasets. A solution with time complexity better than O(n^3) would be desirable, where n is the number of cities.

**Example:**

```python
cities = [("A", 34.0522, -118.2437), ("B", 37.7749, -122.4194), ("C", 40.7128, -74.0060)]
budget = 10000.0
cost_per_km = 10.0
train_speed = 1.0

# Example solution (this is just an example; the actual solution should be calculated by your code)
railway_lines = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C")]
max_travel_time = 450.0
total_cost = 8000.0

# Your code should return:
# (railway_lines, max_travel_time, total_cost)
```

This problem demands a solid understanding of graph theory, optimization, and efficient algorithm design. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Python coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator. In a distributed system, data is often spread across multiple nodes (databases, services, etc.). To ensure data consistency, transactions that modify data across these nodes must be atomic â€“ either all changes are committed, or none are.

Your coordinator will manage transactions involving multiple resources. Resources are represented by integers. Each resource can either be in a 'READY' state or a 'LOCKED' state. Initially, all resources are 'READY'.

The coordinator should support the following operations:

1.  **`begin_transaction(transaction_id)`:** Starts a new transaction with the given `transaction_id` (an integer). A transaction can only be started if no transaction with the same ID is already in progress.

2.  **`prepare(transaction_id, resource_ids)`:** Attempts to prepare the specified `transaction_id` to commit changes on the specified `resource_ids` (a list of integers). Preparation involves locking the specified resources. A resource can only be locked if it is in the 'READY' state.  If *any* of the resources cannot be locked (because they are already locked by another transaction), the preparation fails. In this case, the resources should *not* be locked, and the coordinator should return `False`. If all resources are successfully locked, the coordinator returns `True`.

3.  **`commit(transaction_id)`:** Commits the transaction with the given `transaction_id`. This releases all resources locked by that transaction, setting their state back to 'READY'.

4.  **`rollback(transaction_id)`:** Rolls back the transaction with the given `transaction_id`. This releases all resources locked by that transaction, setting their state back to 'READY'.

5.  **`status(resource_id)`:** Returns the current status of the specified `resource_id`. This should return either "READY" or "LOCKED".

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   Transaction IDs are unique positive integers.
*   Resource IDs are unique positive integers.
*   Multiple transactions can be in progress simultaneously, but a transaction can only lock a resource if it's available.
*   A transaction can only be committed or rolled back if it has been prepared successfully.
*   If a transaction attempts to `prepare` the same resource more than once, it should be considered an error and the function should return `False`.
*   If a `commit` or `rollback` is called on a transaction that doesn't exist, the coordinator should ignore the call.
*   The coordinator should handle concurrent calls to these functions from multiple threads or processes safely (thread-safe/process-safe).  Assume the number of resources and transactions can be very large.
*   The solution should be optimized for speed.  The `prepare` operation is critical.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the time it takes to execute the `prepare` operation, especially when dealing with a large number of resources.
*   Ensure thread-safe access to shared data structures without introducing excessive locking overhead.

**Real-World Scenario:**

This problem simulates a simplified version of how distributed databases and microservices handle transactions across multiple components.

**System Design Aspects:**

Consider how you would design the data structures to efficiently track transaction states and resource locks.  Think about how you would handle potential deadlocks (although you don't need to implement deadlock detection/resolution for this problem, the design should be mindful of it).

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The `prepare` operation should ideally have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of resources being locked *for that transaction*. Consider using appropriate data structures to achieve this.
*   The `commit` and `rollback` operations should be efficient in releasing the locked resources.

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems concepts. Good luck!

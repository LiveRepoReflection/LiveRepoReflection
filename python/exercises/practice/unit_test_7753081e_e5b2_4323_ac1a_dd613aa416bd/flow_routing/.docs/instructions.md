Okay, here is a challenging Python coding problem designed to test various algorithmic skills and data structure knowledge.

**Problem Title:  Optimal Multi-Commodity Flow Routing with Congestion**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a network that transports multiple types of commodities. The network is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent communication links.  Each link has a limited capacity.  Simultaneously, there are multiple requests to transport different commodities between different source-destination pairs.

Formally:

*   **Network:** A directed graph `G = (V, E)` where `V` is the set of nodes (locations) and `E` is the set of directed edges (communication links).
*   **Edge Capacity:** Each edge `e` in `E` has a capacity `c(e)` representing the maximum amount of flow that can pass through it.
*   **Commodities:**  There are `K` different commodities.
*   **Requests:**  Each commodity `k` has `N_k` requests.  Each request `i` (for commodity `k`) is defined by a tuple `(s_k_i, t_k_i, d_k_i)`, where:
    *   `s_k_i` is the source node for request `i` of commodity `k`.
    *   `t_k_i` is the destination node for request `i` of commodity `k`.
    *   `d_k_i` is the demand (amount of flow) for request `i` of commodity `k`.

*   **Congestion Cost:**  When the total flow on an edge `e` exceeds its capacity `c(e)`, a congestion cost is incurred.  The congestion cost function is defined as follows:

    *   If `total_flow(e) <= c(e)`, the congestion cost for edge `e` is 0.
    *   If `total_flow(e) > c(e)`, the congestion cost for edge `e` is `(total_flow(e) - c(e))^2`.

Your goal is to find a routing for all requests that minimizes the *total congestion cost* across all edges in the network.  A routing specifies, for each request `(s_k_i, t_k_i, d_k_i)`, a path in the graph from `s_k_i` to `t_k_i` along which the flow `d_k_i` will be sent. You are allowed to split the flow of a single request across multiple paths (fractional routing).

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format (you'll need to parse it):

1.  **Graph Description:**
    *   `num_nodes`: The number of nodes in the graph. Nodes are numbered from 0 to `num_nodes - 1`.
    *   `num_edges`: The number of edges in the graph.
    *   A list of `num_edges` tuples, each representing an edge: `(u, v, capacity)`, where `u` is the source node, `v` is the destination node, and `capacity` is the capacity of the edge.

2.  **Commodity Requests:**
    *   `num_commodities`: The number of different commodities.
    *   For each commodity `k` (from 0 to `num_commodities - 1`):
        *   `num_requests_k`: The number of requests for commodity `k`.
        *   A list of `num_requests_k` tuples, each representing a request: `(source, destination, demand)`.

**Output:**

Your program should output a routing that minimizes the total congestion cost.  The routing should be represented as a dictionary:

```python
routing = {
    (commodity_index, request_index): {  # Key: A tuple representing the (commodity index, request index)
        path: flow_amount  # Value: A dictionary where keys are paths (lists of node indices) and values are the amount of flow sent along that path.
    }
}
```

For example:

```python
routing = {
    (0, 0): {  # Commodity 0, Request 0
        (0, 1, 2, 3): 5.0,  # Send 5.0 units of flow along the path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
        (0, 4, 3): 2.0       # Send 2.0 units of flow along the path 0 -> 4 -> 3
    },
    (0, 1): { # Commodity 0, Request 1
        (1, 5, 6): 3.0
    },
    (1, 0): { # Commodity 1, Request 0
        (7, 8, 9): 10.0
    }
}
```

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Graph Size:** The graph can be large (up to 1000 nodes and 5000 edges).
*   **Number of Commodities and Requests:** There can be a significant number of commodities and requests (up to 100 commodities and 100 requests per commodity).
*   **Capacity Constraints:**  You *must* respect the capacity constraints of the edges.
*   **Optimality:** Finding the *absolute* optimal solution for this problem is NP-hard.  Your goal is to find a *good* solution that minimizes the total congestion cost as much as possible within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 minutes). You may explore approximation algorithms, heuristics, or metaheuristics.
*   **Computational Complexity:** Solutions with exponential computational complexity will likely time out. Focus on efficient algorithms and data structures.
*   **Floating-Point Precision:**  Be mindful of floating-point precision issues when dealing with flow values.
*   **Disconnected Graphs:** The graph may not be fully connected.  If a request cannot be routed (no path exists between source and destination), your algorithm should handle it gracefully and potentially not route that request (or route a minimal amount).
*   **Memory Constraints:**  Be mindful of memory usage, especially for large graphs and many requests.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** Does your routing satisfy all the constraints (capacity constraints, flow conservation)?
2.  **Total Congestion Cost:** How low is the total congestion cost achieved by your routing?  Solutions with lower congestion costs will be ranked higher.
3.  **Efficiency:** How quickly does your algorithm find a solution? Solutions that time out will receive a very low score.
4.  **Scalability:** How well does your algorithm perform as the graph size, number of commodities, and number of requests increase?

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of performance and scalability. Good luck!

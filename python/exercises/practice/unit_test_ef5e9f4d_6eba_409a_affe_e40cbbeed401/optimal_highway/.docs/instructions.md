## Question: Optimal Highway Placement

### Question Description

A major logistics company, "OmniRoute," is planning to build a new high-speed highway network to connect several key cities across a large geographical region. They have a detailed map of the region, represented as a graph. Cities are nodes in the graph, and the existing road network (prior to the new highway) are the edges. Each road has a cost (time in hours) associated with it to traverse.

OmniRoute wants to select a subset of city pairs to connect directly with new, ultra-fast highways. Building a highway between any two cities has a construction cost and provides a significant reduction in travel time compared to the existing road network.

**The Problem:**

Given:

*   A graph `G = (V, E)` representing the road network, where:
    *   `V` is the set of cities (nodes).
    *   `E` is the set of existing roads (edges), with `cost(u, v)` representing the travel time between cities `u` and `v`.
*   A list of possible highway connections `H = {(u, v, c, t)}`, where:
    *   `(u, v)` represents the pair of cities that can be connected by a highway.
    *   `c` is the construction cost of building a highway between `u` and `v`.
    *   `t` is the travel time between `u` and `v` using the new highway (guaranteed to be significantly less than the shortest path time between `u` and `v` in the original road network).
*   A budget `B` representing the total amount OmniRoute can spend on highway construction.
*   A set of target cities `T` which contains the starting city and ending city.

Your task is to determine the optimal set of highway connections `S` (a subset of `H`) to build, such that:

1.  The total construction cost of the highways in `S` does not exceed the budget `B`: `sum(c for (u, v, c, t) in S) <= B`.
2.  The travel time between the starting city to the ending city in `T` is minimized, considering both the existing road network `E` and the newly built highways in `S`.  If there is no possible path between the starting and ending city, return `float('inf')`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of cities `|V|` can be up to 1000.
*   The number of existing roads `|E|` can be up to 5000.
*   The number of possible highway connections `|H|` can be up to 200.
*   The construction cost `c` of each highway is a positive integer.
*   The travel time `t` of each highway is a positive integer.
*   The budget `B` is a positive integer.
*   The travel time `cost(u, v)` of each existing road is a positive integer.
*   The graph `G` is undirected.
*   The graph `G` is connected.

**Input:**

Your function should take the following input:

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the graph `G`, where keys are city names (strings) and values are dictionaries representing neighboring cities and their associated travel times. For example:
    `graph = {'A': {'B': 10, 'C': 15}, 'B': {'A': 10, 'D': 12}, 'C': {'A': 15, 'D': 5}, 'D': {'B': 12, 'C': 5}}`
*   `highways`: A list of tuples representing the possible highway connections `H`. For example:
    `highways = [('A', 'B', 50, 2), ('B', 'D', 75, 3), ('A', 'D', 120, 4)]`
*   `budget`: An integer representing the budget `B`.
*   `targets`: A tuple representing the starting and ending cities in `T`. For example:
    `targets = ('A', 'D')`

**Output:**

Your function should return a float representing the minimum travel time between the starting and ending cities, considering the optimal set of highway connections. Return `float('inf')` if no path is possible within the budget.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {'A': {'B': 10, 'C': 15}, 'B': {'A': 10, 'D': 12}, 'C': {'A': 15, 'D': 5}, 'D': {'B': 12, 'C': 5}}
highways = [('A', 'B', 50, 2), ('B', 'D', 75, 3), ('A', 'D', 120, 4)]
budget = 125
targets = ('A', 'D')

# Expected Output: 7  (Build highways A-B and B-D. Path: A -> B -> D = 2 + 3 = 5.  Building only A-D costs 120 and gives a path of 4. A -> C -> D = 15 + 5 = 20. A-> B -> D = 10 + 12 = 22. Therefore optimal path is A->B->D using highways.)
```

**Scoring:**

The solution will be judged based on its correctness and efficiency. Solutions that time out or use excessive memory will receive a lower score. Optimizations are highly encouraged.

**Note:**

This is a challenging problem that requires careful consideration of different highway combinations and their impact on the overall travel time.  Dynamic programming or graph search algorithms with pruning techniques might be helpful.

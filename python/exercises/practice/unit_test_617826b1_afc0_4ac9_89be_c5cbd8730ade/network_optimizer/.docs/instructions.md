Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging coding problem. Here's the problem description:

## Project Name

`NetworkOptimization`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient data transmission network for a large distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each identified by a unique integer from `0` to `N-1`. These nodes need to communicate with each other.

The network infrastructure allows you to establish bidirectional communication links between any two nodes. However, establishing a direct link between nodes `i` and `j` has a cost associated with it, denoted as `cost(i, j)`. You are given a function `cost(i, j)` that calculates this cost. This function is computationally expensive, so you must minimize the number of times it is called.

Additionally, due to physical limitations, each node can only support a maximum of `K` direct connections (links) to other nodes.

The network needs to satisfy a set of communication requests. You are given a list of `M` communication requests, where each request is a tuple `(source, destination, data_size)`. This means node `source` needs to transmit `data_size` units of data to node `destination`.

Your goal is to design a network topology (a set of direct links between nodes) that minimizes the overall cost of establishing the network while satisfying all communication requests. You are allowed to split the data transmission across multiple paths in the network (i.e., use intermediate nodes to relay the data).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
*   `1 <= M <= 5000` (Number of communication requests)
*   `1 <= K <= 10` (Maximum number of direct connections per node)
*   `1 <= data_size <= 100` (Size of data to be transmitted for each request)
*   The `cost(i, j)` function is provided (you don't need to implement it, but you must use it).
*   The `cost(i, j)` function always returns a non-negative integer.
*   It is guaranteed that a solution exists.
*   Your solution should be efficient enough to complete within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few minutes).

**Requirements:**

1.  Implement a function `design_network(N, M, K, communication_requests, cost)` that takes the number of nodes `N`, the number of communication requests `M`, the maximum number of connections per node `K`, a list of communication requests `communication_requests`, and the `cost` function as input.
2.  Your function should return a list of tuples representing the network topology. Each tuple `(i, j)` in the list indicates a direct communication link between node `i` and node `j`. The order of the tuples does not matter.
3.  The returned network topology must satisfy the following conditions:
    *   Each node `i` has at most `K` direct connections.
    *   For each communication request `(source, destination, data_size)`, there must exist at least one path (possibly using intermediate nodes) between `source` and `destination` in the network. This path must have enough capacity to carry `data_size` units of data. The capacity of a path is the minimum capacity of any link along that path. Assume that the capacity of a link `(i, j)` is 100 if the link exists and 0 otherwise.
    *   The total cost of establishing the network topology (sum of `cost(i, j)` for each link `(i, j)`) must be minimized.
4.  Your solution will be evaluated based on the total cost of the resulting network topology. Lower cost solutions will be preferred.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   The primary goal is to minimize the total cost of the network topology.
*   Minimize calls to the `cost(i, j)` function.
*   Consider using heuristics or approximation algorithms to find a near-optimal solution within the time limit.
*   Consider using efficient data structures (e.g., adjacency lists or matrices) to represent the network topology.

This problem challenges the solver to balance network connectivity, node degree constraints, cost minimization, and computational efficiency. They'll need to consider graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and efficient data structures to devise a solution that finds a good network topology within the given constraints. Good luck!

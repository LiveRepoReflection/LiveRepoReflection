Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations.

**Problem Title:  Optimal Multi-Commodity Flow Scheduling**

**Problem Description:**

You are managing a logistics network for a large e-commerce company.  The network consists of warehouses (nodes) and transportation routes (edges) connecting them.  Each transportation route has a capacity representing the maximum number of "units" of goods that can be transported along it in a given time period.

Your task is to schedule the movement of multiple commodities (different types of goods) through the network to satisfy demands at various destination warehouses while minimizing the overall transportation cost.

Specifically:

1.  **Network Representation:**  The logistics network is represented as a directed graph. Each node represents a warehouse, and each directed edge represents a transportation route between two warehouses. Each edge has a `capacity` and a `cost per unit` of commodity transported along it.

2.  **Commodities:** You are given a list of commodities. Each commodity is defined by a `source` warehouse, a `destination` warehouse, and a `demand` (the number of units of that commodity that must be transported from the source to the destination).  Multiple commodities can share the same source or destination.

3.  **Constraints:**
    *   **Capacity Constraints:** The total flow of all commodities along any edge must not exceed the edge's capacity.
    *   **Demand Satisfaction:**  The demand for each commodity must be fully satisfied.
    *   **Flow Conservation:** For each commodity and each warehouse (node) that is *not* the source or destination for that commodity, the total inflow of that commodity must equal the total outflow of that commodity.

4.  **Objective:** Minimize the total cost of transporting all commodities.  The cost of transporting a commodity along an edge is the product of the flow of that commodity along the edge and the edge's cost per unit.

**Input:**

*   `num_warehouses`: An integer representing the number of warehouses (nodes) in the network, numbered from 0 to `num_warehouses - 1`.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a directed edge in the form `(source, destination, capacity, cost_per_unit)`. `source` and `destination` are integers representing the warehouse indices, `capacity` is an integer, and `cost_per_unit` is a float.
*   `commodities`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a commodity in the form `(source, destination, demand)`. `source` and `destination` are integers representing the warehouse indices, and `demand` is an integer.

**Output:**

*   A float representing the minimum total cost of transporting all commodities while satisfying all constraints.
*   If it's impossible to satisfy all demands given the network's capacity constraints, return `-1.0`.

**Example:**

```python
num_warehouses = 4
edges = [
    (0, 1, 10, 1.0),  # Warehouse 0 to 1, capacity 10, cost 1.0 per unit
    (0, 2, 5, 2.0),   # Warehouse 0 to 2, capacity 5, cost 2.0 per unit
    (1, 3, 7, 1.5),   # Warehouse 1 to 3, capacity 7, cost 1.5 per unit
    (2, 3, 8, 0.5)    # Warehouse 2 to 3, capacity 8, cost 0.5 per unit
]
commodities = [
    (0, 3, 6),       # Commodity from 0 to 3, demand 6
    (0, 3, 2)        # Commodity from 0 to 3, demand 2
]

# Expected output:  (The minimum cost will depend on the optimal flow distribution)
# The total demand from 0 to 3 is 8.
# One possible solution:
#  - 6 units from 0->1->3 (cost 6 * 1.0 + 6 * 1.5 = 15.0)
#  - 2 units from 0->2->3 (cost 2 * 2.0 + 2 * 0.5 = 5.0)
#  Total cost = 20.0
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_warehouses <= 100`
*   `1 <= len(edges) <= 500`
*   `0 <= source, destination < num_warehouses` for edges and commodities.
*   `1 <= capacity <= 100` for each edge.
*   `0.1 <= cost_per_unit <= 10.0` for each edge (cost is a float).
*   `1 <= len(commodities) <= 20`
*   `1 <= demand <= 50` for each commodity.
*   Multiple edges can exist between two warehouses, but their capacities are considered separately.
*   The sum of all commodity demands might be large, so efficient algorithms are crucial.

**Challenge Aspects:**

*   **Algorithm Choice:**  This problem is best tackled with network flow algorithms, specifically minimum-cost flow.  However, naive implementations will likely time out.  Consider using efficient algorithms like the Cycle-Canceling Algorithm or the Successive Shortest Path Algorithm, potentially with optimizations like using a Fibonacci heap for Dijkstra's algorithm within the Successive Shortest Path approach.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Handle cases where no feasible solution exists (e.g., insufficient capacity to meet demand).  Consider cases with parallel edges.
*   **Optimization:**  The problem requires careful optimization to avoid exceeding time limits.  Optimize your data structures and algorithm choices for performance.
*   **Real-World Relevance:** This problem models a common logistics challenge, making it relatable and interesting.
*   **System Design Consideration:**  Although not a full-blown system design problem, consider how this component would fit into a larger logistics system.  How would you handle dynamic changes in demand or network conditions?
*   **Multiple Approaches:** While minimum-cost flow algorithms are the standard approach, you might explore other optimization techniques (e.g., linear programming solvers) if you are familiar with them.  Each approach will have its own trade-offs in terms of complexity and performance.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful coding to achieve a solution that passes all test cases within the time constraints. Good luck!

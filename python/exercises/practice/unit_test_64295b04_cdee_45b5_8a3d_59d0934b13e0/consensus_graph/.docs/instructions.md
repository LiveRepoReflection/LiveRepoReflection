## Problem: Distributed Consensus Graph

### Question Description

You are designing a distributed system where multiple nodes must agree on the structure of a graph. This graph represents relationships between entities in the system, and maintaining a consistent view of the graph across all nodes is critical for the system's integrity.

Each node in the system initially holds a partial, potentially inaccurate, view of the graph. These partial views are represented as sets of edges. Your task is to implement a distributed consensus algorithm that allows the nodes to converge on a single, consistent graph representation.

Specifically, you need to implement a function `consensus_graph(node_views, max_iterations)` that takes the following inputs:

*   `node_views`: A list of sets, where each set represents a node's initial view of the graph's edges. Each edge is represented as a tuple of two node IDs (integers), e.g., `(1, 2)` represents an edge between node 1 and node 2. Note that the graph is undirected, so `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` represent the same edge.

*   `max_iterations`: An integer representing the maximum number of iterations the consensus algorithm can run. This is a safeguard to prevent the algorithm from running indefinitely if it fails to converge.

Your function should implement the following consensus algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:** Each node starts with its initial `node_view`.
2.  **Iteration:**
    *   In each iteration, each node sends its current graph view to all other nodes.
    *   Each node receives the graph views from all other nodes.
    *   Each node updates its graph view by taking the union of all received graph views and its own current graph view.
3.  **Convergence Check:** After each iteration, check if all nodes have the same graph view. If they do, the algorithm has converged.
4.  **Termination:** The algorithm terminates when either all nodes have the same graph view (convergence) or the maximum number of iterations (`max_iterations`) is reached.

Your function should return the final, agreed-upon graph view (a set of edges) that all nodes possess after the algorithm terminates.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Correctness:** The algorithm must eventually converge to the correct graph view (the union of all initial views) if given enough iterations and no conflicting information (nodes don't lie or provide false data).
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm should minimize communication overhead and computational complexity. Consider the trade-offs between different approaches. Aim for a solution that is efficient for a moderate number of nodes (e.g., up to 100) and a moderate number of edges (e.g., up to 1000).
*   **Scalability (Bonus):** While not strictly required for full marks, consider how your solution might scale to a much larger number of nodes and edges. Can you identify potential bottlenecks and suggest strategies to mitigate them? Could you use techniques like message passing interface (MPI) for parallelization?
*   **Undirected Graphs:** Remember that the graph is undirected. Handle edges `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` as equivalent.
*   **Node IDs:** Node IDs are integers. The range of Node IDs is not explicitly given, but you can assume they are non-negative.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases such as:
    *   Empty `node_views` list.
    *   Empty sets in `node_views`.
    *   `max_iterations` is 0.
*   **No External Libraries:** You should only use built-in Python data structures and functions. Do not use any external libraries (e.g., `networkx`).

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   The union operation on sets can be computationally expensive, especially with large sets. Consider alternative data structures or algorithms if this becomes a bottleneck.
*   The communication overhead of sending the entire graph view to all nodes in each iteration can be significant. Explore techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted, such as sending only the differences between graph views. However, implementing difference-based communication significantly increases complexity and is not required for a correct solution.
*   Consider how the number of nodes and edges affects the performance of your algorithm. Are there any optimizations that are particularly effective for specific graph densities (sparse vs. dense)?

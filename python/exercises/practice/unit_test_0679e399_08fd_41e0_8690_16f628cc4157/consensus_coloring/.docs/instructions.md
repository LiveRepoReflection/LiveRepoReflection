## Problem: Distributed Consensus Graph Coloring

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed algorithm for solving a graph coloring problem on a massive, dynamically changing graph. The graph represents dependencies between tasks in a large-scale distributed system.  Each node in the graph represents a task, and an edge between two nodes indicates that the corresponding tasks cannot be executed concurrently (they have a dependency).

Your goal is to assign a "color" (represented by an integer) to each task such that no two adjacent tasks have the same color.  Minimizing the number of colors used is desirable but not strictly required. The primary focus is ensuring correctness and scalability in a distributed environment.

**The challenges:**

1.  **Scale:** The graph is extremely large and cannot be stored on a single machine. Nodes and edges are distributed across a network of worker nodes.
2.  **Dynamicity:** Tasks are constantly being added and removed from the system, and dependencies between tasks may change over time. This means the graph structure is dynamic, requiring your algorithm to adapt to continuous updates.
3.  **Distributed Consensus:** Nodes must reach a consensus on their assigned color in a decentralized manner. No central authority or coordinator exists.
4.  **Communication Overhead:** Minimize the communication between worker nodes to reduce network congestion and improve performance.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to node failures. If a worker node crashes, the remaining nodes should be able to continue the coloring process correctly.
6.  **Asynchronous Operations:** Worker nodes operate asynchronously and may have different processing speeds. Your algorithm must function correctly in this asynchronous environment.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **Input:** The input to your solution is a stream of events representing changes to the graph. These events are received by individual worker nodes. Events include:
    *   `AddNode(node_id)`:  Adds a new node (task) to the graph. The worker node receiving this event becomes responsible for managing the state of this node.
    *   `RemoveNode(node_id)`: Removes a node from the graph.
    *   `AddEdge(node_id1, node_id2)`: Adds an edge between two nodes.  The worker nodes responsible for `node_id1` and `node_id2` must update their internal state to reflect this new edge.
    *   `RemoveEdge(node_id1, node_id2)`: Removes an edge between two nodes.
*   **Output:** Your algorithm should eventually converge to a valid graph coloring where no adjacent nodes have the same color. There's no explicit "output" to the system. Instead, each worker node should maintain the current color assignment for the nodes it manages. The color assignment can be queried at any time.
*   **Consistency:** After processing a sufficiently long sequence of events and allowing the system to stabilize, querying any two adjacent nodes should reveal that they have different colors.
*   **Fairness:** Your solution should avoid starvation, ensuring that every node eventually gets a color assigned.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes can be up to 10<sup>9</sup>.
*   The number of edges can be up to 10<sup>10</sup>.
*   The number of worker nodes is significantly smaller than the number of graph nodes. Assume 10<sup>3</sup> worker nodes.
*   Worker nodes communicate via message passing (e.g., using a library like `zmq` or `grpc`). You are free to choose the specific communication protocol.
*   Message sizes should be kept small to minimize network overhead.
*   The graph is sparse (the average degree of a node is relatively small compared to the total number of nodes).

**Considerations:**

*   You need to devise a suitable data structure to represent the graph locally within each worker node.
*   You need to design a distributed consensus mechanism to ensure that adjacent nodes agree on their colors. Consider using a variation of existing distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft, or Gossip protocols) or a completely novel approach.  However, be mindful of the communication overhead inherent in these algorithms.
*   Think about how to handle conflicts when two adjacent nodes attempt to assign themselves the same color concurrently.
*   Consider the trade-offs between the number of colors used and the time it takes to converge to a valid coloring.
*   Consider how to efficiently handle node and edge additions/removals in a distributed manner.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, graph algorithms, and data structures. It challenges you to design a scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient solution for a complex real-world problem. Good luck!

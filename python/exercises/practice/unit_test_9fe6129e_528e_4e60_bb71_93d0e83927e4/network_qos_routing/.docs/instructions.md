Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem.

**Problem Title:  Optimal Multi-Hop Network Routing with QoS Constraints**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a multi-hop network where each node has limited processing capacity and varying link qualities. The network consists of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. You are given the following information:

*   **Nodes:** Represented as a list of tuples, `nodes = [(cpu_capacity, cost_per_packet), ...]`. `cpu_capacity` is an integer representing the processing capacity of the node (number of packets it can handle per unit time). `cost_per_packet` is an integer representing the cost incurred for processing each packet.
*   **Edges:** Represented as a list of tuples, `edges = [(node1, node2, latency, packet_loss_rate), ...]`. `node1` and `node2` are integers representing the connected nodes. `latency` is an integer representing the delay (in milliseconds) for a packet to traverse the link. `packet_loss_rate` is a float between `0` and `1` representing the probability of a packet being lost on that link.
*   **Source and Destination:** You are given a source node `source` and a destination node `destination`.
*   **Traffic Demand:** You are given a traffic demand `demand` (number of packets per unit time) that needs to be routed from the `source` to the `destination`.
*   **Quality of Service (QoS) Requirements:** You are given the following QoS requirements:
    *   **Maximum Latency:** `max_latency` (in milliseconds). The total latency of the path must not exceed this value.
    *   **Maximum Packet Loss Rate:** `max_packet_loss_rate` (a float between `0` and `1`). The cumulative packet loss rate of the path must not exceed this value.  Note that packet loss rates are multiplicative, so the overall packet loss rate for a path is calculated as `1 - (1 - loss_rate_link1) * (1 - loss_rate_link2) * ... * (1 - loss_rate_linkN)`.

**Objective:**

Your task is to find the **minimum cost** path (sequence of nodes and edges) to route the given `demand` from the `source` to the `destination` while satisfying the given `max_latency` and `max_packet_loss_rate` constraints, and respecting the processing capacity of each node along the path. The cost of a path is the sum of the cost incurred at each node along the path for processing the packets.

**Constraints:**

1.  `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
2.  `0 <= source, destination < N`
3.  `0 <= demand <= 1000`
4.  `0 <= max_latency <= 10000`
5.  `0 <= max_packet_loss_rate <= 1`
6.  `0 <= cpu_capacity <= 1000` for each node
7.  `0 <= cost_per_packet <= 100` for each node
8.  `0 <= latency <= 1000` for each edge
9.  `0 <= packet_loss_rate <= 1` for each edge
10. The network may not be fully connected.
11. A node's `cpu_capacity` represents how many packets it can process. If the `demand` exceeds any node's capacity along the path, the path is invalid and should not be considered.
12. If no valid path exists that satisfies all the constraints, return `-1`.

**Input:**

*   `nodes`: A list of tuples representing the nodes.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the edges.
*   `source`: The source node.
*   `destination`: The destination node.
*   `demand`: The traffic demand.
*   `max_latency`: The maximum allowed latency.
*   `max_packet_loss_rate`: The maximum allowed packet loss rate.

**Output:**

*   The minimum cost (integer) to route the traffic, or `-1` if no valid path exists.

**Example:**

```python
nodes = [(50, 1), (60, 2), (40, 3), (70, 1)]  # (cpu_capacity, cost_per_packet)
edges = [(0, 1, 10, 0.05), (0, 2, 15, 0.1), (1, 3, 20, 0.02), (2, 3, 25, 0.08)] # (node1, node2, latency, packet_loss_rate)
source = 0
destination = 3
demand = 30
max_latency = 60
max_packet_loss_rate = 0.2

# Expected Output: 90
# Path 0 -> 1 -> 3:  Cost = 30 * 1 (node 0) + 30 * 2 (node 1) + 30 * 1 (node 3) = 30 + 60 + 30 = 120. Latency = 10 + 20 = 30. Packet Loss Rate = 1 - (1-0.05)*(1-0.02) = 0.0689 < 0.2, all nodes also have capacity.
# Path 0 -> 2 -> 3: Cost = 30 * 1 (node 0) + 30 * 3 (node 2) + 30 * 1 (node 3) = 30 + 90 + 30 = 150. Latency = 15 + 25 = 40. Packet Loss Rate = 1 - (1-0.1)*(1-0.08) = 0.172 < 0.2, all nodes also have capacity.
# Because this is a minimization problem, you need to find the path which satisfies the QoS constraints, but also minimizes the cost. The optimal cost in this case is 90.
```

**Note:**  This problem requires careful consideration of multiple constraints and the need for an efficient algorithm to explore the possible paths. Standard shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford need to be adapted to handle the QoS constraints and capacity limitations.  Consider using techniques like pruning the search space to improve performance. Good luck!

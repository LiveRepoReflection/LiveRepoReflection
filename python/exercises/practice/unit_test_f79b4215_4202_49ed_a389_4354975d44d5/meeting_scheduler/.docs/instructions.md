### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient meeting scheduler for a large organization. The organization has a complex hierarchical structure. Each employee has a manager, and there is a single CEO at the top of the hierarchy. An employee can have multiple direct reports.

Employees have varying levels of availability throughout the week. Each employee's availability is represented as a list of time slots. Each time slot is a tuple containing the start time and end time, represented as integers (0-167), where 0 represents Monday 00:00, 1 represents Monday 00:30, and 167 represents Sunday 23:30.

You are given a list of employees who need to attend a meeting and a desired meeting duration (in units of 30 minutes). Your goal is to find the **earliest possible time slot** when **all** of the given employees are available for the meeting.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Employee Hierarchy:** You must consider the employee hierarchy when scheduling meetings. A meeting should ideally be scheduled during a time when the fewest number of employees are interrupted from their routine work. Therefore, you need to minimize the total "interruption score".
2.  **Interruption Score:** The interruption score is calculated as follows: For each employee *not* in the meeting who is a direct or indirect report of *any* employee in the meeting, add 1 to the interruption score if the scheduled meeting time overlaps with their availability.
3.  **Earliest Meeting Time:** If multiple time slots yield the same minimum interruption score, select the earliest one.
4.  **Large Dataset:** The organization has a large number of employees, and the number of attendees for a meeting can be significant. Efficiency is critical.
5.  **No External Libraries:** You are restricted to using Python's built-in data structures and standard library modules. No external libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, or scheduling libraries are allowed.

**Input:**

*   `employees`: A dictionary where keys are employee IDs (integers) and values are lists of time slots representing their availability. Example: `{1: [(0, 4), (8, 12)], 2: [(2, 6), (10, 14)]}`
*   `hierarchy`: A dictionary representing the employee hierarchy. Keys are employee IDs (integers), and values are a list of employee IDs of their direct reports. Example: `{1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: []}`. Assume the CEO has no manager, but they still exist in the hierarchy as a key, with the possibility of having direct reports.
*   `attendees`: A list of employee IDs (integers) who must attend the meeting. Example: `[1, 2, 4]`
*   `duration`: An integer representing the meeting duration in units of 30 minutes.

**Output:**

*   A tuple representing the start and end time of the earliest possible meeting slot (integers). Return `None` if no such slot exists where all attendees are available.

**Example:**

```
employees = {
    1: [(0, 4), (8, 12)],
    2: [(2, 6), (10, 14)],
    3: [(0, 2), (4, 6)],
    4: [(10, 12)]
}
hierarchy = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [4],
    3: []
}
attendees = [1, 2, 4]
duration = 2

Expected Output: (10, 12)
```

**Clarifications and Edge Cases:**

*   Assume that time slots are non-overlapping for each employee.
*   Consider all possible start times (0-167) for the meeting and check if the duration fits within the available time slots.
*   The end time of a time slot is exclusive (e.g., (0, 4) means the employee is available from time 0 up to, but not including, time 4).
*   Meeting times must fall within the 0-167 range.
*   The hierarchy is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
*   All employee IDs in `attendees` will exist in both `employees` and `hierarchy`.
*   Optimize for minimal time complexity. A brute-force approach may result in a timeout.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures (representing availability and hierarchy), algorithms (searching for optimal meeting times and calculating interruption scores), and optimization techniques to handle large datasets efficiently. Good luck!

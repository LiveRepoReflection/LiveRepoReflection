## Question: Optimal Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Dynamic Demand

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal delivery route for a fleet of vehicles operating from multiple depots to serve a set of geographically dispersed customers. This is a variation of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with the following constraints and considerations:

*   **Multiple Depots:** You have `N` depots, each with a limited number of vehicles and a specific starting time window (vehicles must depart within this window). Each depot has a different set of vehicles with different capacities.
*   **Customers:** You have `M` customers, each with a specific demand (weight/volume of goods to be delivered) and a service time window (the delivery must occur within this window). Each customer must be serviced exactly once.
*   **Vehicles:** You have a fleet of vehicles, each with a limited capacity and a fixed cost per unit distance traveled. Vehicles must start and end their routes at the same depot.
*   **Time Windows:** Deliveries to customers must be made within the customer's specified time window. Similarly, vehicles must depart from their assigned depot within the depot's departure window. If a vehicle arrives at a customer before the start of the time window, it must wait.
*   **Dynamic Demand:** During the route, new delivery requests (customers with demand and time windows) can arrive. The system must be able to dynamically adapt the existing routes to accommodate these new requests, minimizing the overall cost increase. You can assume new customer demands appear at specific times which you can use to plan the new route. You can also assume the new customers cannot be "ignored" - they must be serviced.
*   **Capacity Constraints:** The total demand of the customers served by a vehicle on a single route cannot exceed the vehicle's capacity.
*   **Objective:** Minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the travel cost for all vehicles used. The travel cost is calculated as the distance traveled multiplied by the vehicle's cost per unit distance. You want to minimize the total distance travelled by all vehicles to serve all customers.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

1.  `N`: The number of depots.
2.  `M`: The initial number of customers.
3.  Depot Data: A list of `N` tuples, where each tuple contains:
    *   `(depot_id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate, num_vehicles, vehicle_capacity, vehicle_cost_per_distance, start_time_window_start, start_time_window_end)`
4.  Customer Data: A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple contains:
    *   `(customer_id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate, demand, service_time_window_start, service_time_window_end)`
5.  Distance Matrix: An `(N+M) x (N+M)` matrix representing the travel distance between any two locations (depots and customers). The first `N` rows/columns correspond to the depots, and the remaining `M` rows/columns correspond to the customers.
6.  Dynamic Demand Events: A list of tuples sorted by time. Each tuple contains:
    *   `(arrival_time, customer_id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate, demand, service_time_window_start, service_time_window_end)`

**Output:**

The output should be a single floating-point number, which represents the minimum total cost achieved after incorporating all dynamic demand events. The cost should be calculated from the total distance travelled by all vehicles to serve all customers.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 5
*   1 <= `M` <= 50 (initial number of customers)
*   0 <= `number of dynamic demand events` <= 20
*   Customer and depot coordinates are integers between 0 and 1000.
*   Demands are integers between 1 and 100.
*   Time windows are integers representing seconds from the start of the simulation (0). All time windows are valid.
*   Vehicle capacities are integers between 100 and 500.
*   Vehicle cost per distance is a floating-point number between 0.1 and 1.0.
*   The distance matrix contains floating-point numbers representing distances.
*   All customer IDs are unique.

**Requirements:**

*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the dynamic demand events within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1 minute).
*   You should aim to minimize the total cost, even when dynamic demand arrives.
*   Your solution should be robust and handle all valid input cases.
*   Consider the trade-offs between re-optimizing the entire route after each dynamic demand event versus making local adjustments.
*   Your solution should be implemented in Python.
*   The objective is to find a solution that minimizes the total cost, and the solution should not be significantly worse (e.g., more than 10%) than a known optimal or near-optimal solution.

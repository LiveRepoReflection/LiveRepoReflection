## Project: Scalable Recommendation System

### Question Description

Design and implement a scalable recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The platform has a massive user base and a large catalog of products. The goal is to provide personalized product recommendations to each user in real-time.

**Input:**

*   A stream of user events. Each event includes:
    *   `user_id`: An integer representing the user.
    *   `event_type`: A string indicating the type of event (e.g., "view", "purchase", "add_to_cart").
    *   `product_id`: An integer representing the product.
    *   `timestamp`: An integer representing the time of the event (Unix timestamp).
*   A product catalog with information about each product:
    *   `product_id`: An integer representing the product.
    *   `category`: A string representing the product category.
    *   `price`: A float representing the product price.
    *   `other_features`: A dictionary representing additional product features.
*   A set of user profiles. Each profile includes:
    *   `user_id`: An integer representing the user.
    *   `purchase_history`: A list of `product_id`s representing the user's past purchases.
    *   `view_history`: A list of `product_id`s representing the user's past views.
    *   `other_features`: A dictionary representing additional user features.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Real-time Recommendations:** Given a `user_id`, return a list of `product_id`s representing the top-k recommendations for that user. Recommendations should be generated in near real-time (e.g., within 200ms).
2.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a high volume of user events and product catalog updates. Consider how the system will scale with millions of users and products.
3.  **Personalization:** Recommendations should be personalized based on the user's past behavior, product catalog information, and user profile. Implement at least two distinct recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches) and allow the system to dynamically switch between them based on performance metrics.
4.  **Cold Start Problem:** Address the cold start problem for new users and new products. When a new user or product is encountered, the system should provide reasonable recommendations.
5.  **Dynamic Updates:** The system should be able to handle dynamic updates to the product catalog (e.g., new products added, product information updated).
6.  **Performance Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms for monitoring the performance of the recommendation system (e.g., hit rate, click-through rate, latency).
7.  **Efficiency:** Optimize the algorithms for speed and memory usage, considering the large scale of the data. Pre-computation and caching strategies are strongly encouraged.
8.  **Fault Tolerance:** Provide mechanisms to ensure the recommendation system can continue to serve requests, even when some part of the system fails.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution should be implemented in Python.
*   You can use any standard Python libraries and data structures.
*   You are encouraged to use external libraries for machine learning and data processing (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy).
*   You are encouraged to use external data stores and caching systems (e.g., Redis, Memcached, Cassandra, MongoDB).
*   The system should be designed to be deployed on a distributed infrastructure (e.g., cloud platform).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The recommendations should be relevant to the user's interests.
*   Performance: The system should meet the real-time latency requirements and handle a high volume of requests.
*   Scalability: The system should be able to scale to millions of users and products.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   Design: The system design should be well-reasoned and address the challenges of scalability, personalization, and the cold start problem.
*   Originality: Use of multiple recommendation methods, dynamic switching, performance monitoring, and efficient data structures will be looked upon favorably.

This problem is open-ended and requires careful consideration of various design trade-offs. The goal is to create a robust and scalable recommendation system that can provide personalized recommendations in real-time.

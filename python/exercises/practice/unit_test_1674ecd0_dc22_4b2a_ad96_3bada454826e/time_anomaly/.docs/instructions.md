Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to test advanced Python skills:

**Project Name:** Scalable Time Series Anomaly Detection

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a scalable anomaly detection system for real-time time series data.  Your system will receive a continuous stream of numerical data points representing a metric (e.g., server CPU utilization, website traffic, sensor readings).  The goal is to identify anomalous data points *as quickly as possible* while maintaining high accuracy.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Data Structure:** Implement a data structure optimized for storing and querying a sliding window of the recent *N* data points.  This window needs to support efficient addition of new data points and removal of the oldest data points. `N` can be very large.
2.  **Anomaly Detection Algorithm:** Implement a modified version of the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) algorithm to detect anomalies. The standard EWMA calculates the average based on a decay factor. Enhance the EWMA algorithm to be *adaptive* by dynamically adjusting the decay factor based on the *variance* of the recent data points within the sliding window. A higher variance should lead to a faster decay (smaller alpha) to react quickly to changes. A lower variance should lead to a slower decay (larger alpha) to avoid reacting to noise.
3.  **Scalability:** Your solution must be scalable to handle high data ingestion rates. Minimize computational complexity where possible. Consider the time complexity of all operations.
4.  **Thresholding:** Implement a dynamic thresholding mechanism. The threshold for anomaly detection should be calculated based on the *standard deviation* of the EWMA values within a recent period (e.g., the last *M* EWMA values, where M <= N). A data point is considered anomalous if it deviates from the current EWMA by more than *k* standard deviations of the recent EWMA values.
5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases gracefully, such as:
    *   The initial period before enough data points are available to calculate a reliable EWMA or standard deviation.
    *   Sudden, large shifts in the baseline data distribution.
    *   Missing or `None` data points (handle by either skipping or imputing a reasonable value).
6.  **Constraints:**
    *   **Memory Usage:** Limit the memory footprint of your solution, especially the size of the sliding window.
    *   **Real-time Performance:** Optimize for low latency. Anomaly detection should be performed with minimal delay after a new data point arrives.
    *   **No External Libraries:** You are restricted to using Python's standard library, except for the `collections` module (e.g., `deque`).  No NumPy, Pandas, or other external numerical libraries are allowed.
7. **Report:** Write a short report to demonstrate the algorithm that is used and how to handle the constraints and edge cases.

**Input:**

Your solution should accept a stream of numerical data points (floats or integers).  You can simulate this stream using a generator or by reading from a file.

**Output:**

For each data point, your solution should output whether it is considered an anomaly (`True` or `False`). Additionally, provide the current EWMA value and the dynamic threshold used for the decision.

**Example:**

```python
for data_point, is_anomaly, ewma, threshold in anomaly_detector(data_stream, N=100, M=20, k=3.0):
    print(f"Data: {data_point}, Anomaly: {is_anomaly}, EWMA: {ewma:.2f}, Threshold: {threshold:.2f}")
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Accurate anomaly detection across a variety of test datasets, including those with different types of anomalies (spikes, drops, shifts).
*   **Efficiency:** Time complexity of data ingestion, EWMA calculation, and anomaly detection.
*   **Scalability:** Performance with large data streams and window sizes.
*   **Memory Usage:** Efficient use of memory, especially for the sliding window.
*   **Code Quality:** Readability, maintainability, and adherence to Python best practices.
*   **Handling of Edge Cases:** Robustness in the face of unusual data patterns.
*   **Report:** Demonstration of the algorithm and the handling of constrains and edge cases

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and statistical concepts.  The constraints encourage optimization and careful design choices. Good luck!

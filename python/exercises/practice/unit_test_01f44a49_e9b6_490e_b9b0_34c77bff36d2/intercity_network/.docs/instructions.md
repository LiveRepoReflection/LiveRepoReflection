Okay, here's a high-difficulty programming competition problem for you.

**Project Name:** `Intercity-Transportation-Network`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient intercity transportation network. The network consists of cities and various modes of transportation connecting them.  Each mode of transportation has an associated cost (e.g., ticket price) and time (e.g., duration of travel).

Given a set of cities, transportation modes, and a limited budget (`B`) and time constraint (`T`), your goal is to find the *maximum* number of distinct cities that can be visited starting from a designated origin city, without exceeding the budget `B` or the time limit `T`.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Cities:** Represented by unique integer IDs (1 to N).
2.  **Transportation Modes:** Represented as a list of tuples: `(city_A, city_B, cost, time)`. This tuple means there's a transportation mode from city_A to city_B costing `cost` and taking `time`. The graph is directed. There can be multiple transportation modes between two cities with different costs and times.
3.  **Origin City:** A designated starting city ID.
4.  **Budget (B):** An integer representing the maximum amount of money you can spend.
5.  **Time Limit (T):** An integer representing the maximum amount of time you can spend traveling.
6.  **Constraints:**
    *   You must start at the origin city.
    *   You cannot visit the same city multiple times.
    *   You can only travel between cities using the provided transportation modes.
    *   You must not exceed the budget `B` or the time limit `T`.
7.  **Objective:**  Return the *maximum* number of *distinct* cities you can visit, including the origin city, while adhering to all the constraints.
8.  **Optimization:** Aim for the most computationally efficient solution possible. Solutions with exponential time complexity are unlikely to pass all test cases.
9.  **Edge Cases:** Consider cases such as:
    *   No path exists from the origin city to any other city.
    *   The origin city has no outgoing transportation modes.
    *   The budget or time limit is zero.
    *   The graph may not be fully connected.
    *   Cycles in the graph.

**Example:**

```
Cities: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Transportation Modes: [(1, 2, 10, 5), (1, 3, 15, 8), (2, 4, 20, 12), (3, 4, 5, 3)]
Origin City: 1
Budget (B): 40
Time Limit (T): 20
```

One possible solution is to visit cities {1, 3, 4}. This costs 15 + 5 = 20 and takes 8 + 3 = 11. The number of distinct cities visited is 3.  Another is {1,2,4}.

The optimal solution is to visit cities {1, 3, 4}, which yields 3 distinct cities within budget and time.

This problem requires careful consideration of graph traversal algorithms, dynamic programming techniques, and efficient data structure utilization to achieve optimal performance.  Good luck!

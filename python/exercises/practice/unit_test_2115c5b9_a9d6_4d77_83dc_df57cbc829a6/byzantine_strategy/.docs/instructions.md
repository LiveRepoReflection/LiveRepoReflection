## The Byzantine Generals' Optimal Strategy

**Question Description:**

In the realm of distributed computing, the Byzantine Generals Problem looms large.  You are tasked with developing an optimal strategy for a simplified, yet challenging, version of this problem.

Imagine a network of `N` generals, each controlling a division of soldiers. One of these generals is the commander. The commander must issue an order to either "Attack" or "Retreat."  Each general (including the commander) then relays this order to the other generals.

However, some generals might be traitors. Traitorous generals can act maliciously:

*   They can send conflicting orders to different generals (e.g., "Attack" to some, "Retreat" to others).
*   They can send the opposite of the commander's order.
*   They can simply not send any order.

The goal is to design an algorithm that allows the loyal (non-traitorous) generals to reach a consensus on a single action (either "Attack" or "Retreat") despite the presence of traitors.

**Input:**

You are given the following:

1.  `N`: The total number of generals in the network (1 <= N <= 100).
2.  `T`: The maximum number of traitors that could exist in the network (0 <= T < N).
3.  A message-passing system represented by a function `receive_messages(general_id, round_number)`. This function simulates the messages received by a general in a particular round. It returns a list of messages received by `general_id` in `round_number`.  A message is a string, either "Attack" or "Retreat", or None if the general sent nothing.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Agreement:** All loyal generals must eventually decide on the *same* action (either "Attack" or "Retreat").
2.  **Validity:** If the commander is loyal and issues an order, then all loyal generals must follow that order.
3.  **Optimization:** Your algorithm should minimize the number of message-passing rounds required to reach a consensus.  The algorithm must guarantee a consensus within a defined number of rounds.
4.  **Practicality:**  The algorithm should be implementable and executable within reasonable time and memory constraints. The maximum time allowed for the execution is 1 second and memory limit is 1GB.
5.  **Edge Cases:** You must handle edge cases such as:
    *   `N` = 1 (the commander is the only general)
    *   `T` = 0 (no traitors)
    *   `T` is close to `N` (many traitors, consensus may be impossible to guarantee the commander's order.)
6.  **Assume perfect information about N and T.** Every general knows the total number of generals `N` and the maximum number of traitors `T`.
7.  **Assume synchronous communication.** All messages sent in a round are received by all generals before the next round begins.
8.  **The commander is general 0.**

**Output:**

Your algorithm should return either "Attack" or "Retreat," representing the consensus action reached by the loyal generals. If a consensus cannot be reached within a reasonable number of rounds (defined implicitly by the time limit), the algorithm should return "Undecided".

**Example:**

```python
def solve_byzantine_generals(N, T, receive_messages):
    """
    Solves the Byzantine Generals Problem.

    Args:
        N: The total number of generals.
        T: The maximum number of traitors.
        receive_messages: A function that simulates message passing.

    Returns:
        "Attack", "Retreat", or "Undecided".
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
```

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Correctness:**  Does your algorithm consistently reach a consensus among loyal generals? Does it follow the commander's order when the commander is loyal?
2.  **Efficiency:**  How many message-passing rounds does your algorithm require on average?
3.  **Robustness:**  Does your algorithm handle edge cases and different traitor configurations gracefully?

This is a challenging problem requiring a deep understanding of distributed consensus algorithms, fault tolerance, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

## Question: Optimal Highway Placement

**Problem Description:**

The Ministry of Infrastructure Planning is embarking on a new ambitious project: constructing a national highway system connecting several major cities. You, as a senior algorithm engineer, are tasked with determining the optimal placement of highway segments to minimize the overall construction cost.

You are given a set of `N` cities, represented as (x, y) coordinates on a 2D plane. The ministry requires that every city must be reachable from every other city via the highway system (directly or indirectly).

The cost of building a highway segment between two cities is proportional to the Euclidean distance between them, *plus* a fixed setup cost. Specifically, the cost of a highway segment between city `i` and city `j` is:

`cost(i, j) = sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2) + C`

where `(x_i, y_i)` and `(x_j, y_j)` are the coordinates of cities `i` and `j` respectively, and `C` is a constant representing the fixed setup cost for any highway segment.

Your task is to find the minimum total cost required to connect all the cities into a single connected component via highway segments.

**Input:**

*   `cities`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(x, y)` represents the coordinates of a city. (e.g., `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0)]`)
*   `C`: A positive floating-point number representing the fixed setup cost for each highway segment.

**Output:**

*   A floating-point number representing the minimum total cost required to connect all the cities. The output should be accurate to within a tolerance of `1e-6`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of cities)
*   `-1000 <= x, y <= 1000` (Coordinates of cities)
*   `0.01 <= C <= 100.0` (Setup cost)
*   Assume that all city coordinates are distinct.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider the algorithmic complexity of your approach.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   The number of cities can be small (e.g., 1 or 2).
*   The setup cost `C` can significantly impact the optimal solution. A large `C` might favor shorter highways, while a small `C` might favor fewer, longer highways.
*   Consider the potential for floating-point precision issues and ensure your solution is robust to them.
*   Multiple valid highway configurations might achieve the minimum cost. Your solution only needs to return the minimum cost itself.

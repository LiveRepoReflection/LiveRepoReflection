### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed, eventually consistent cache system. This system needs to handle a high volume of read and write requests while maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Nodes:** The cache system consists of `N` nodes, each with limited storage capacity. Nodes are numbered from `0` to `N-1`.

2.  **Data Items:** Data is stored as key-value pairs. Keys are strings, and values are arbitrary Python objects (that can be serialized).

3.  **API:** Implement the following methods:

    *   `put(key: str, value: object, timestamp: int)`: Stores the key-value pair in the cache with the given timestamp. The timestamp represents the time the data was last modified. Higher timestamps indicate more recent data.
    *   `get(key: str) -> (object, int)`: Retrieves the most recent value associated with the key, along with its timestamp. If the key is not found, return `(None, -1)`.
    *   `remove(key: str, timestamp: int)`: Removes the key-value pair if the provided timestamp is greater than or equal to the current timestamp of the key.

4.  **Eventual Consistency:** The system does not guarantee strong consistency. Data written to one node might not be immediately visible to other nodes. However, updates should eventually propagate across all nodes.

5.  **Data Replication:** Implement a replication strategy where each key-value pair is stored on `R` nodes. Use consistent hashing to determine which nodes are responsible for storing a given key.

6.  **Conflict Resolution:** When different nodes have different values for the same key, use the timestamp to resolve conflicts. The value with the highest timestamp wins.

7.  **Node Failures:** The system must be resilient to node failures. If a node goes down, the other nodes should continue to operate. When a node recovers, it needs to synchronize its data with the rest of the system.

8.  **Cache Eviction:** Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy for each node. When a node reaches its storage capacity, the least recently accessed key-value pair should be evicted to make room for new data.

9.  **Concurrency:** Ensure that all operations are thread-safe. Multiple clients might concurrently access the cache system.

**Constraints:**

*   `N` (number of nodes): 1 <= `N` <= 100
*   `R` (replication factor): 1 <= `R` <= `N`
*   Storage capacity per node: 1MB (approximate number of key-value pairs that can be stored on one node will be used for testing).
*   Number of concurrent clients: Up to 1000.
*   Assume a simple string-based key.
*   Timestamps are non-negative integers.
*   Minimize latency for `get` operations.
*   Minimize data loss in the face of node failures.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a gossip protocol for data synchronization between nodes.
*   Add support for data compression to increase storage capacity.
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the health and performance of the cache system.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. The solution should be well-designed, efficient, and robust.

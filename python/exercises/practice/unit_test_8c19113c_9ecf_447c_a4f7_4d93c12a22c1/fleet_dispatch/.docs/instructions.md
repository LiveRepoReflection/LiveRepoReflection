## Question: Optimal Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Dispatch

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a fleet management system for an autonomous vehicle (AV) network operating in a large city. The city is represented as a weighted, directed graph where nodes are intersections and edges are road segments, with weights representing travel time in seconds.

You are given a set of ride requests. Each ride request consists of:

*   A pick-up intersection ID.
*   A drop-off intersection ID.
*   A request time (in seconds from the start of the simulation).
*   A reward for completing the ride (integer value).
*   A maximum waiting time (in seconds). If a vehicle cannot reach the pick-up location within this time after the request is made, the request is considered expired and cannot be fulfilled.

You have a fleet of *K* identical AVs, each initially located at a designated "depot" intersection. Each AV can serve at most one ride at a time. Once an AV completes a ride, it is available to be dispatched to a new request. The time to load/unload a passenger is negligible.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that maximizes the total reward earned by your AV fleet over a fixed simulation time *T* (in seconds).

**Constraints:**

*   The city graph can have up to 1000 intersections and 5000 road segments.
*   The number of ride requests can be up to 10000.
*   The simulation time *T* can be up to 86400 seconds (24 hours).
*   *K* (the number of AVs) can be between 1 and 100.
*   Travel times on road segments are positive integers.
*   Rewards for completing rides are positive integers.
*   The pick-up and drop-off locations are distinct for each request.
*   An AV can only accept a ride request if it can reach the pick-up location within the maximum waiting time for that request.
*   Once an AV accepts a ride, it *must* complete it. There is no canceling a ride mid-route.
*   You must consider the time it takes for an AV to travel from its current location (either the depot initially, or the drop-off location of the previous ride) to the pick-up location of a new ride.
*   The objective is to maximize the total reward, not the number of rides completed. Higher rewards are preferred even if it means completing fewer rides.
*   Ride requests arrive over the entire simulation time *T*.
*   Pre-computation is allowed, but should be reasonable (e.g. precomputing all-pairs shortest paths is acceptable, but extremely complex or time-consuming pre-computations may not be).
*   The algorithm must be efficient enough to produce a reasonably good solution within a time limit of, say, 1 minute.  An optimal solution is not required, but a good heuristic is needed.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

1.  **Graph Data:** A list of edges, each specified by a source intersection ID, a destination intersection ID, and a travel time (integer).
2.  **Ride Requests:** A list of ride requests, each specified by a pick-up intersection ID, a drop-off intersection ID, a request time (integer), a reward (integer), and a maximum waiting time (integer).
3.  **Number of AVs (K):** An integer representing the number of autonomous vehicles.
4.  **Depot Intersection ID:** The ID of the intersection where all AVs start.
5.  **Simulation Time (T):** An integer representing the total simulation time in seconds.

**Output:**

Your program should output a single integer: the maximum total reward that can be earned by the AV fleet during the simulation time *T*.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on the total reward earned. Test cases will vary in size and complexity. Solutions that produce higher rewards within the time limit will be ranked higher. Solutions will be tested with hidden test cases. Efficiency and scalability will be considered.

**Hint:**

This problem is NP-hard, meaning there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to find the absolute optimal solution. Consider using heuristics, approximation algorithms, or metaheuristic approaches to find a good solution within the time limit. Dynamic programming with careful state representation might also be helpful for smaller instances.

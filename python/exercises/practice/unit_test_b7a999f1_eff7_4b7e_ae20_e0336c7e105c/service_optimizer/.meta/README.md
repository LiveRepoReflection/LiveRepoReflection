# Service Optimizer

This project implements an algorithm to optimize inter-service communication paths in a microservice architecture by strategically placing caches and service replicas.

## Problem Description

In a microservice architecture, services communicate with each other to fulfill user requests. The network latency between services affects the overall performance. This tool optimizes the communication paths between services by introducing intelligent caching and replication.

The algorithm takes into account:
- A directed graph representing service dependencies
- Latency costs for communication between services
- Critical service pairs that require optimization
- Budget constraints for cache placement
- Limits on service replication
- Cache hit probability

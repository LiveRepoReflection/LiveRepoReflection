## Question: Optimized Network Pathfinding for Dynamic Congestion

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient pathfinding system for a large-scale network, such as a city's transportation grid or a data center network. The network is represented as a weighted graph where nodes represent locations (e.g., intersections, servers) and edges represent connections between them (e.g., roads, network cables). The weight of each edge represents the cost of traversing that connection (e.g., travel time, latency).

However, the network is highly dynamic. The cost of traversing an edge can change frequently due to congestion. Congestion occurs when a large number of "packets" (e.g., cars, data packets) are using an edge simultaneously. The congestion level on an edge `e` at time `t` is represented by a value `c(e, t)` where `0 <= c(e, t) <= 1`. A value of 0 means no congestion and the edge cost is at its base value. A value of 1 represents maximum congestion and the edge cost increases linearly to a maximum defined cost.

Formally, the cost of an edge `e` at time `t` is calculated as:

`cost(e, t) = base_cost(e) + c(e, t) * (max_cost(e) - base_cost(e))`

Your system must be able to:

1.  **Find the Lowest Latency Path:** Given a source node `s`, a destination node `d`, and a time window `[start_time, end_time]`, find the path with the lowest *cumulative* cost considering the dynamic congestion.  The cumulative cost is the sum of the cost of each edge *at the time the packet traverses that edge*.

2.  **Predictive Routing:** Given a source node `s`, a destination node `d`, a start time `start_time`, and a maximum time window `max_travel_time`, find the best path *before* starting the traversal.  Since the congestion levels are constantly changing, you must *predict* the congestion at each edge at the time the packet will be traversing it. Assume you have access to a `congestion_prediction(edge, time)` function that returns the predicted congestion level `c(e, time)` for an edge `e` at a given `time`. This function is an oracle, and its accuracy is not your concern; you must use it as-is. The goal is to minimize the *predicted* cumulative cost.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Large-Scale Network:** The graph can contain a large number of nodes and edges (e.g., 10^5 nodes, 10^6 edges).
*   **Dynamic Edge Costs:** Edge costs change frequently. Your algorithm needs to adapt to these changes.
*   **Time Dependency:** Path costs depend on the time the edge is traversed.
*   **Efficiency:** The pathfinding algorithms must be efficient, considering the large scale and dynamic nature of the network.  Naive solutions will time out.
*   **Optimization:** Focus on minimizing the *cumulative cost* of the path, not just the number of hops.
*   **Realistic Congestion:** Congestion impacts edges linearly.
*   **Prediction Oracle:** You *must* use the `congestion_prediction(edge, time)` function for predictive routing. You cannot make assumptions about its accuracy.
*   **Single Path:**  Your solution should return only *one* best path, not multiple alternatives.
*   **Path Traversal Time:** Assume that traversing an edge `e` takes a fixed amount of time equal to `base_cost(e)`. This is used to determine the time at which subsequent edges in the path are traversed.

**Input:**

*   A graph represented as a dictionary: `{node1: [(node2, base_cost, max_cost), ...], node2: [...], ...}` where `node1` and `node2` are node identifiers (strings or integers), `base_cost` is the base cost of the edge, and `max_cost` is the cost of the edge at maximum congestion.
*   Source node `s`.
*   Destination node `d`.
*   Start time `start_time` (a numerical timestamp).
*   End time `end_time` (for Lowest Latency Path, a numerical timestamp).
*   Maximum travel time `max_travel_time` (for Predictive Routing, a numerical timestamp).
*   A `congestion_prediction(edge, time)` function (for Predictive Routing).

**Output:**

*   For "Find the Lowest Latency Path":  A list of nodes representing the path from `s` to `d` with the lowest *actual* cumulative cost within the given time window `[start_time, end_time]`. If no path exists within the time window, return an empty list.
*   For "Predictive Routing": A list of nodes representing the *predicted* best path from `s` to `d`, starting at `start_time`, with a total predicted travel time not exceeding `max_travel_time`. If no path exists within the time constraint, return an empty list.

**Scoring:**

Solutions will be judged based on:

1.  **Correctness:**  Finding a valid path from source to destination.
2.  **Efficiency:**  Performance on large graphs. Solutions that time out will receive a score of 0.
3.  **Optimality:**  Minimizing the cumulative cost of the returned path. Solutions returning paths with significantly higher costs than the optimal path will receive a lower score.

This is a hard problem that requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

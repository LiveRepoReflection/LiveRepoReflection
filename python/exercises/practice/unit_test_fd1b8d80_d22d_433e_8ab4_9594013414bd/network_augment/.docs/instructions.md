Okay, here's a coding problem designed to be challenging and complex, aimed at a "LeetCode Hard" level. It involves graph traversal, optimization under constraints, and real-world modelling.

**Problem Title: Optimized Public Transportation Network Augmentation**

**Problem Description:**

A major metropolitan area is experiencing rapid population growth, leading to severe strain on its existing public transportation network. The city council has decided to augment the network by adding a limited number of new transportation hubs. The goal is to minimize the average commute time for all citizens after the new hubs are added, while also considering budget constraints and real-world limitations.

You are provided with the following information:

1.  **Existing Transportation Network:** A directed graph representing the existing public transportation network. Nodes represent locations within the city (e.g., bus stops, train stations), and directed edges represent transportation routes between them. Each edge has a *travel time* and a *capacity*.

2.  **Citizen Commute Data:** A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a citizen's daily commute. Each tuple contains a *start location*, an *end location*, and the *number of citizens* making that specific commute.

3.  **Potential Hub Locations:** A list of locations where new transportation hubs can be built. Building a hub at a location has a *construction cost*.

4.  **Hub Connectivity:** When a hub is built at a location, it automatically creates directed edges (routes) to *all existing* locations in the transportation network, and directed edges from *all existing* locations to the new hub. Each new edge's *travel time* is calculated based on the geographical distance between the locations, and each edge's *capacity* is a fixed constant.

5.  **Budget Constraint:** A maximum budget for constructing new hubs.

6.  **Hub Capacity:** Each hub has a maximum throughput capacity.  The sum of all citizens passing through a hub (either entering or exiting) cannot exceed this capacity.

**Your Task:**

Write a function that takes the above information as input and returns a list of locations where new transportation hubs should be built to minimize the average commute time for all citizens, subject to the budget and hub capacity constraints.

**Specifically, your function should:**

1.  **Determine the Optimal Hub Locations:** Select a subset of potential hub locations to build hubs at, such that the total construction cost does not exceed the budget.
2.  **Update the Transportation Network:** Add the selected hubs and their associated edges to the existing transportation network, creating a new augmented network.
3.  **Calculate New Commute Times:**  For each citizen commute, find the shortest path in the augmented network from the start location to the end location. Calculate the total commute time for all citizens by summing up the product of the number of citizens and their respective commute times.
4.  **Calculate Hub Usage:** For each hub, determine the total number of citizens using that hub. A citizen uses a hub if the shortest path of their commute passes through that hub.
5.  **Enforce Capacity Constraints:** Ensure that the number of citizens using each hub does not exceed the hub's capacity. If it does, your solution is invalid.
6.  **Optimization:** Find the combination of hub locations that yields the smallest average commute time for all citizens. The average commute time is calculated as (Total Commute Time) / (Total Number of Citizens).
7.  **Return the Chosen Hub Locations:** Return a list of node IDs representing the locations where hubs should be built.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of potential hub locations can be large.
*   The transportation network can be large and complex.
*   Finding the shortest path between locations needs to be efficient (consider using algorithms like Dijkstra or A\*).
*   The budget constraint significantly limits the number of hubs that can be built.
*   The hub capacity constraint can further limit the feasible solutions.
*   Multiple optimal solutions may exist. Your solution should return one of them.
*   Prioritize minimizing *average* commute time rather than total commute time.

**Input Format:**

The input data will be provided in a structured format (e.g., dictionaries, lists of tuples). Assume appropriate data structures for representing graphs (e.g., adjacency lists) and citizen commute data.  The details of the input format can be specified when you provide your solution.

**Expected Output:**

A list of integers representing the node IDs of the chosen hub locations.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on:

1.  **Correctness:** Does your solution satisfy all constraints (budget, hub capacity)? Does it produce a valid list of hub locations?
2.  **Efficiency:** How efficiently does your solution explore the search space of possible hub location combinations?  Faster solutions will be preferred.
3.  **Optimality:** How close is your solution to the true minimum average commute time? Solutions with lower average commute times will be preferred.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques (e.g., heuristics, approximation algorithms), and the ability to balance multiple conflicting objectives under constraints.  Good luck!

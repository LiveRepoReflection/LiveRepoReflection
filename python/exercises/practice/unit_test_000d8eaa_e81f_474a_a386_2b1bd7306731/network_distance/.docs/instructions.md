Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem description, designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level.

**Problem Title: Decentralized Social Network Graph Analysis**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with analyzing a decentralized social network represented as a peer-to-peer (P2P) graph.  Each node in the graph represents a user, and each directed edge represents a follow relationship.  Unlike centralized social networks, there's no central server holding the complete graph. Instead, each user (node) only knows their direct followers and followees (neighbors in the graph).

You are given the ability to query any user in the network. When queried, a user returns two lists: their list of user IDs they are following (outgoing edges) and a list of user IDs that follow them (incoming edges).  You are also given a starting user ID.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given a starting user ID and a maximum "degree of separation" `k`, identifies all unique users within `k` degrees of separation from the starting user.  Degree of separation is defined as the minimum number of hops required to reach a user from the starting user.  Both incoming and outgoing edges count as a single hop.

However, there are significant constraints:

1.  **Decentralized Data:** You cannot assume you have the entire graph in memory. You must query users on-demand using the provided `query_user(user_id)` function. The `query_user` function is external and you cannot modify it.
2.  **Network Latency:** Querying a user is an expensive operation (simulating network latency). Minimize the number of calls to `query_user(user_id)` as much as possible.
3.  **Large Network:** The network can be very large (millions of users), so memory usage should be optimized.  Avoid storing the entire graph in memory if possible.
4.  **Cycles:** The graph may contain cycles. Your solution must avoid infinite loops.
5.  **User ID Format:** User IDs are integers.  They are not necessarily sequential or small.
6.  **k Constraint**: The parameter `k` is non-negative. If `k=0`, the solution only contains the start user.
7.  **Query Limit:** You are allowed a *maximum* of `Q` queries to the `query_user` function. If you exceed this limit, your solution will be considered incorrect. The value of `Q` will be provided as an input.
8.  **Invalid Users:** If `query_user` is called with a user ID that does not exist, it returns `None`. Your code should handle this gracefully and not crash. Invalid users do not contribute to the degree of separation.

**Input:**

*   `start_user_id`: An integer representing the ID of the starting user.
*   `k`: An integer representing the maximum degree of separation.
*   `query_user`: A function that takes a user ID as input and returns a tuple `(following, followers)` where `following` is a list of user IDs that the user follows, and `followers` is a list of user IDs that follow the user. If the user ID is invalid, it returns `None`.
*   `Q`: An integer representing the maximum number of calls allowed to query_user

**Output:**

*   A set of integers representing the unique user IDs within `k` degrees of separation from the `start_user_id`, *including* the `start_user_id` itself.

**Example:**

Let's say:

*   `start_user_id = 1`
*   `k = 2`

And the graph structure (as could be returned by `query_user`):

*   `query_user(1)  returns ([2, 3], [4])`  (User 1 follows 2 and 3, and is followed by 4)
*   `query_user(2)  returns ([5], [1])` (User 2 follows 5, and is followed by 1)
*   `query_user(3)  returns ([], [1])` (User 3 follows nobody, and is followed by 1)
*   `query_user(4)  returns ([1], [])` (User 4 follows 1, and is followed by nobody)
*   `query_user(5)  returns ([], [2])` (User 5 follows nobody, and is followed by 2)

Then the output should be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.  Explanation:

*   Degree 0: {1}
*   Degree 1: {2, 3, 4} (users directly connected to 1)
*   Degree 2: {5} (user connected to 2, who is connected to 1)

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= start_user_id <= 10^9`
*   `0 <= k <= 10`
*   The number of users in the network can be up to 10^6.
*   The number of followers/followees for a given user can be up to 10^3.

This problem requires a careful combination of graph traversal, optimization to minimize query calls, and efficient memory management. Good luck!

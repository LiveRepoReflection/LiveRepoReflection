## Question: Optimized Intermodal Route Planning

**Description:**

You are tasked with building an optimized route planning system for a logistics company that utilizes a combination of trucks, trains, and ships for transporting goods between various locations. The transportation network is represented as a weighted graph where nodes represent locations (cities, ports, train stations) and edges represent transportation routes. Each edge has attributes: `source`, `destination`, `mode` (truck, train, ship), `cost`, and `time`.

The company has a set of origin-destination pairs (O-D pairs) for which they need to find the most cost-effective routes. However, there are several constraints and optimization goals:

1.  **Mode Compatibility:** Not all locations are accessible by all modes of transportation. A truck can go almost anywhere, trains can only travel between train stations, and ships can only travel between ports. The input will clearly define which locations support which transportation modes.

2.  **Transfer Costs:** Switching between modes of transportation (e.g., from truck to train) incurs a fixed transfer cost at the location where the transfer occurs. This cost is dependent on the specific modes involved in the transfer (e.g., truck-to-train transfer cost might be different from ship-to-train).

3.  **Capacity Constraints:** Each edge (route segment) has a maximum capacity. If the total goods being transported along a specific route exceeds its capacity, the cost and time for that route segment increase linearly with the amount exceeding the capacity.

4.  **Time Windows:** Each O-D pair has a time window within which the goods must arrive at the destination. The route planning system must ensure that the selected route respects this time window. If it's not possible to meet the time window constraint, the route is considered invalid.

5.  **Optimization Goal:** The primary goal is to minimize the total cost of transportation for all O-D pairs. This cost includes transportation costs along the edges and transfer costs between modes.  If multiple routes have the same cost, the route with the shortest time is preferred.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   A list of locations, with a flag indicating whether each location supports truck, train, and ship transportation.
*   A list of edges, each with `source`, `destination`, `mode`, `cost`, `time`, and `capacity`.
*   A matrix of transfer costs between all pairs of modes (e.g., `transfer_costs[truck][train]` represents the cost of transferring from truck to train).
*   A list of O-D pairs, each with an origin location, a destination location, a quantity of goods to be transported, and a time window (start time, end time).

**Output:**

The output should be a list of routes, one for each O-D pair. Each route should include the following information:

*   A list of nodes visited in order.
*   A list of edges used in order (including mode).
*   The total cost of the route.
*   The total time taken for the route.
*   A boolean flag indicating whether the time window constraint was met.

If no valid route can be found for an O-D pair, the output for that pair should indicate that no route was found.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of locations will be up to 1000.
*   The number of edges will be up to 5000.
*   The number of O-D pairs will be up to 100.
*   Edge capacities will be positive integers.
*   Transfer costs will be non-negative integers.
*   The time window can be quite tight.
*   The quantity of goods for each O-D pair will be a positive integer.
*   Your solution must complete execution within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1 minute).
* The graph can be disconnected.

**Challenge:**

The challenge lies in efficiently exploring the vast search space of possible routes, considering mode compatibility, transfer costs, capacity constraints, and time windows.  An optimal solution will likely require a combination of graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A\*), dynamic programming, and potentially heuristics to prune the search space. The complexity of the problem scales significantly with the number of locations, edges, and O-D pairs, requiring an optimized implementation.

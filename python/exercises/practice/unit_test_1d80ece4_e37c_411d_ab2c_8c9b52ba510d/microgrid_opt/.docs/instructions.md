Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test a range of skills.

**Problem Title:** Optimal Resource Allocation in a Dynamic Microgrid

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a system for optimal resource allocation within a dynamic microgrid. The microgrid consists of several energy sources (solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, and a connection to the main power grid) and several energy consumers (houses, businesses, and electric vehicle charging stations).  The goal is to minimize the overall cost of energy consumption within the microgrid, considering fluctuating energy prices from the main grid, variable energy production from renewable sources, and dynamic energy demand from consumers.

**Input:**

The system receives real-time data updates in the following format:

1.  **Time Series Data:** A stream of time-stamped data points representing:
    *   `grid_price(t)`: The price of electricity from the main grid at time *t*.
    *   `solar_generation(t)`: The energy generated by solar panels at time *t*.
    *   `wind_generation(t)`: The energy generated by wind turbines at time *t*.
    *   `demand(consumer_i, t)`: The energy demand of consumer *i* at time *t*. This is provided for each consumer.

2.  **Microgrid Configuration:**
    *   A list of consumers, each identified by a unique ID (`consumer_i`).
    *   Battery storage capacity and charge/discharge rates.
    *   Maximum power draw allowed from the main grid.

**Output:**

For each time step *t*, your system must output:

1.  `grid_power(t)`: The amount of power drawn from the main grid.
2.  `battery_charge_rate(t)`: The rate at which the battery is charged (positive value) or discharged (negative value).
3.  `consumer_power(consumer_i, t)`: The amount of power supplied to each consumer *i*.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the total cost of energy over a sliding time window of *N* time steps.  The cost is calculated as the sum of the cost of grid power and any penalties for unmet demand.
*   **Battery Constraints:** The battery's charge level must remain within its capacity limits. The charge/discharge rate must not exceed the maximum allowed rate.
*   **Grid Constraint:** The power drawn from the main grid must not exceed the maximum allowed limit.
*   **Demand Satisfaction:** The system should strive to meet the demand of all consumers.  However, you can implement a demand prioritization scheme. Unmet demand incurs a penalty cost (higher than the grid price).
*   **Real-time Performance:** The system must process each time step's data and generate the output within a strict time limit (e.g., 100 milliseconds).
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to handle a large number of consumers and energy sources.
*   **Dynamic Conditions:** The system must adapt to changing conditions, such as sudden changes in grid price, renewable energy production, or consumer demand.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Total Cost:** The lower the total cost of energy consumption over a test period, the better.
2.  **Demand Satisfaction:** The higher the percentage of demand met, the better.
3.  **Real-time Performance:** The faster the processing time per time step, the better. Solutions that consistently exceed the time limit will be penalized.
4.  **Scalability:** The ability to handle a large number of consumers and energy sources without significantly impacting performance.
5.  **Code Quality:** Readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding best practices.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

`OptimalNetworkPlacement`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a resilient communication network for a distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each with a unique identifier from `0` to `N-1`. Due to security constraints, direct communication between all node pairs is not allowed. Instead, communication relies on a set of pre-defined, bidirectional communication channels. The network can be represented as an undirected graph, where nodes are vertices and communication channels are edges.

Each node has a specific level of importance, quantified by an "importance score" (a non-negative integer). To enhance the network's resilience against targeted attacks, you need to strategically place `K` mirror servers across the nodes. Mirror servers are special nodes which have complete knowledge of network topology and can reroute the network traffic if any node is compromised.

The effectiveness of a server placement strategy is measured by the *average weighted shortest path* from each node to the nearest mirror server.  The weight of the path is the importance score of the source node.

More formally:

1.  **Nearest Mirror Server:** For each node `i`, determine the shortest path distance `d(i)` to its nearest mirror server (using the unweighted graph distance). If no mirror server can be reached from node `i`, then `d(i) = infinity` (practically, set it to N).
2.  **Weighted Shortest Path:** For each node `i`, calculate the weighted shortest path `w(i) = importance_score(i) * d(i)`.
3.  **Average Weighted Shortest Path:** Calculate the average weighted shortest path across all nodes: `(sum of w(i) for all i from 0 to N-1) / N`.

Your goal is to find an optimal placement of `K` mirror servers that minimizes the average weighted shortest path.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the communication channels. Each tuple `(u, v)` indicates a bidirectional channel between node `u` and node `v` (0 <= u, v < N).  It's guaranteed that the graph is connected. The number of edges will be between `N-1` and `N*(N-1)/2`.
*   `importance_scores`: A list of `N` non-negative integers, where `importance_scores[i]` is the importance score of node `i` (0 <= importance_scores[i] <= 1000).
*   `K`: The number of mirror servers to place (1 <= K <= min(10, N)).

**Output:**

A list of `K` node identifiers representing the optimal placement of mirror servers that minimizes the average weighted shortest path.  If there are multiple solutions, return any one of them.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph represented by `edges` is guaranteed to be connected.
*   The solution must be computationally feasible for `N` up to 1000.
*   The code must be efficient with memory usage. Creating a large adjacency matrix (N x N) may lead to MemoryError.
*   The time limit for execution is strict. Ensure your algorithm is optimized.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)]
importance_scores = [10, 5, 2, 7, 1]
K = 2

One possible optimal solution: [1, 2]
```

**Justification:**

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path), combinatorial optimization (server placement), and careful consideration of efficiency.  A naive brute-force approach of trying all possible combinations of `K` nodes will be too slow for larger values of `N`.  Efficient graph traversal algorithms and heuristics will be necessary to find a near-optimal solution within the time constraints. The importance scores add a layer of complexity, requiring careful weighting of shortest path distances.  The memory constraint discourages the use of large data structures, forcing the candidate to think about efficient representations. The number of mirror servers, K, is small which invites exploration of iterative improvement algorithms or heuristics.

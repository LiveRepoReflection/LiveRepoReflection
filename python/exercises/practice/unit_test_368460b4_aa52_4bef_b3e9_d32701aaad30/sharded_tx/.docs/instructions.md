## Problem Title:  Optimized Distributed Transaction Processing in a Sharded Database

### Problem Description:

You are designing a distributed transaction processing system for a sharded database.  The database is sharded across *N* nodes, where each node is responsible for a subset of the data.  You are given a set of *M* transactions, each of which involves reading and writing data on multiple shards. Your goal is to efficiently execute these transactions while guaranteeing ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Each transaction is represented as a list of operations.  Each operation specifies:

*   `type`:  The type of operation, either "READ" or "WRITE".
*   `shard_id`:  The ID of the shard involved in the operation (an integer between 0 and N-1).
*   `key`: The key of the data being accessed on the shard (a string).
*   `value`: For "WRITE" operations, the value to be written (a string).  For "READ" operations, this field is ignored.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Atomicity:**  All operations in a transaction must either succeed completely or fail completely. If any operation within a transaction fails (e.g., due to a conflict or node failure), the entire transaction must be rolled back.

2.  **Consistency:** The database must transition from one valid state to another valid state after each transaction. You don't need to explicitly enforce consistency of data, but ensure atomicity and isolation which are building blocks of consistency.

3.  **Isolation:**  Transactions must be isolated from each other, as if they were executed serially. Implement Snapshot Isolation (SI) to improve concurrency. Each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database at the time it starts. Writes are buffered and applied only if the transaction commits successfully.

4.  **Durability:**  Once a transaction commits, its changes must be persistent, even in the face of node failures.  Assume that each shard has a local persistent storage mechanism (e.g., a write-ahead log) to ensure durability within the shard. You don't need to implement physical disk writing, but you must guarantee that your solution is durable in the context of this problem.

5.  **Optimization:** Minimize the overall execution time of the transactions.  This is the most challenging aspect of the problem.  Consider the following optimization strategies:

    *   **Parallel Execution:** Transactions that do not conflict can be executed in parallel.
    *   **Reducing Network Latency:** Minimize the number of round trips between the coordinator (your system) and the shards.
    *   **Conflict Detection:** Implement efficient conflict detection to avoid unnecessary rollbacks. SI helps with this.

6.  **Failure Handling:** Handle node failures gracefully. If a shard becomes unavailable during a transaction, the transaction must be aborted and rolled back. You don't need to recover the failed node, just ensure the system can continue processing other transactions.

7. **Scalability:** Design your solution with scalability in mind. The system should be able to handle a large number of shards and transactions.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of shards in the database (an integer).
*   `M`: The number of transactions to execute (an integer).
*   `transactions`:  A list of transactions, where each transaction is a list of operations, as described above.

**Output:**

Return a list of boolean values, where the i-th value indicates whether the i-th transaction committed successfully (True) or was aborted (False).

**Example:**

```python
N = 2  # Two shards
M = 2  # Two transactions

transactions = [
    [  # Transaction 1
        {"type": "READ", "shard_id": 0, "key": "x"},
        {"type": "WRITE", "shard_id": 1, "key": "y", "value": "value1"}
    ],
    [  # Transaction 2
        {"type": "WRITE", "shard_id": 0, "key": "x", "value": "value2"},
        {"type": "READ", "shard_id": 1, "key": "y"}
    ]
]

# Expected Output:  [True, True] (or [True, False] or [False, True] or [False, False] depending on your conflict resolution strategy)
# A possible output could be [True, False], because transaction 2 could conflict with transaction 1's write to shard 1.
```

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does your solution correctly guarantee ACID properties?
*   **Performance:** How efficiently does your solution execute the transactions?  Solutions that minimize execution time will receive higher scores.  Consider the time complexity and potential bottlenecks in your design.
*   **Scalability:** How well does your solution scale as the number of shards and transactions increases?
*   **Failure Handling:** Does your solution handle node failures gracefully?
*   **Code Quality:** Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

**Tips:**

*   Start by implementing a basic solution that guarantees ACID properties, even if it's not very efficient.
*   Then, focus on optimizing your solution for performance.
*   Consider using concurrency control mechanisms like locking or optimistic concurrency control with conflict detection.
*   Think carefully about how to handle node failures and rollbacks.
*   Use appropriate data structures to efficiently manage transaction state and shard information.
*   Snapshot Isolation (SI) will significantly improve concurrency and simplify conflict detection compared to traditional locking.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts and algorithm design. Good luck!

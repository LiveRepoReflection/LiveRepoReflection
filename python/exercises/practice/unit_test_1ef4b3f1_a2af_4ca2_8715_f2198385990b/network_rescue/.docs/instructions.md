Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Python coding problem:

**Problem Title:** Optimal Wireless Network Placement for Disaster Recovery

**Problem Description:**

A major earthquake has struck a region, severely damaging the existing communication infrastructure. You are tasked with deploying a temporary wireless network to facilitate rescue operations and emergency communication. You have a limited number of wireless routers with varying transmission ranges and power consumption, and a map of the disaster area represented as a weighted undirected graph.

The graph's nodes represent key locations (e.g., hospitals, shelters, command centers), and the edges represent the feasibility of establishing a wireless link between two locations. The weight of an edge represents the cost (e.g., terrain difficulty, signal interference) of establishing a direct link between the two locations.  If there is no edge between 2 locations, it is impossible to establish a wireless link directly.

Your goal is to select a subset of locations to place wireless routers such that:

1.  **Connectivity:** Every location in the disaster area must be connected to at least one router, either directly (within the router's transmission range) or indirectly through a path of other connected locations.
2.  **Minimum Power Consumption:** Minimize the total power consumption of the deployed routers. Each router has a fixed power consumption rate (provided).
3. **Budget Constraint:** The total cost of establishing direct wireless links from each router to the locations it covers cannot exceed a given budget. The cost of a direct link is defined as the weight of the edge between the router's location and the location it covers.

**Input:**

*   `num_locations`: An integer representing the number of locations in the disaster area (numbered from 0 to `num_locations` - 1).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(location1, location2, weight)` representing the edges in the graph. `location1` and `location2` are integers representing the locations connected by the edge, and `weight` is a floating-point number representing the cost of establishing a direct link between them.
*   `router_range`: A list of floating-point numbers, where `router_range[i]` represents the transmission range of a router placed at location `i`.  A location *j* is considered directly connected to a router at location *i* if the edge (i, j) exists in the graph.
*   `router_power`: A list of floating-point numbers, where `router_power[i]` represents the power consumption rate of a router placed at location `i`.
*   `budget`: A floating-point number representing the total budget constraint for establishing direct links.

**Output:**

*   A list of integers representing the locations where routers should be placed to satisfy the connectivity, power consumption, and budget constraints, while minimizing the total power consumption. If no solution exists that satisfies all constraints, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `num_locations` <= 20
*   0 <= Number of edges <= `num_locations * (`num_locations` - 1) / 2
*   0 < `router_range[i]` <= 100 for all i
*   0 < `router_power[i]` <= 100 for all i
*   0 < `budget` <= 1000
*   All weights are positive floating-point numbers.
*   Assume the graph is undirected. That is, if `(u, v, w)` is in `edges`, then `(v, u, w)` is also implicitly present with the same weight `w`.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1 minute).  Brute-force solutions will likely time out. Consider using optimization techniques or heuristics.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly identify a valid router placement that satisfies all constraints.
*   Optimality: The solution should aim to minimize the total power consumption of the deployed routers. While a perfectly optimal solution may be difficult to achieve within the time limit, solutions that consistently find lower power consumption placements will be ranked higher.
*   Efficiency: Solutions that execute faster and use less memory will be preferred.

This problem combines graph theory, optimization, and resource constraints, making it a challenging task suitable for a high-level programming competition. Good luck!

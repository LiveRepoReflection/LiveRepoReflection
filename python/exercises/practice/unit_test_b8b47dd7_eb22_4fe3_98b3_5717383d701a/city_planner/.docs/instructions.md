`OptimalCityPlanning`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal city layout for a rapidly growing metropolis. The city can be represented as an `N x N` grid, where each cell represents a potential building location.  The city council has identified several key areas of interest and provided you with specific requirements for building placement to maximize overall citizen satisfaction.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Residential Zones:**  You must place `R` residential zones in the city. Each residential zone occupies a single cell.  Citizens prefer to live near amenities.

2.  **Commercial Hubs:** You must place `C` commercial hubs in the city. Each commercial hub occupies a single cell.  Commercial hubs should be easily accessible from residential zones.

3.  **Parks:** You must place `P` parks in the city. Each park occupies a single cell. Citizens enjoy having parks nearby, but parks should not be directly adjacent to commercial hubs (to minimize noise and traffic).

4.  **Infrastructure Nodes:** You must place `I` infrastructure nodes in the city. Each infrastructure node occupies a single cell. These nodes provide essential services and should be strategically placed to minimize the maximum distance to any residential zone.

5.  **Happiness Score:** The city's happiness score is calculated as follows:

    *   For each residential zone:
        *   Add `commercial_weight / distance_to_nearest_commercial_hub` to the happiness score. Distance uses Manhattan distance (`|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`).
        *   Add `park_weight / distance_to_nearest_park` to the happiness score.
        *   Subtract `infrastructure_weight * maximum_distance_to_infrastructure_node` to the happiness score.

    *   The total happiness score is the sum of the happiness scores for all residential zones.

**Constraints:**

*   `N` (grid size): `5 <= N <= 50`
*   `R` (number of residential zones): `1 <= R <= N*N/4`
*   `C` (number of commercial hubs): `1 <= C <= N*N/4`
*   `P` (number of parks): `1 <= P <= N*N/4`
*   `I` (number of infrastructure nodes): `1 <= I <= min(R, N)`
*   `commercial_weight`, `park_weight`, `infrastructure_weight`: Positive integers between `1` and `100`.
*   No two buildings (residential zone, commercial hub, park, infrastructure node) can occupy the same cell.
*   Parks cannot be directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to commercial hubs.

**Objective:**

Write a function that takes the grid size `N`, the number of each building type (`R`, `C`, `P`, `I`), and the weights (`commercial_weight`, `park_weight`, `infrastructure_weight`) as input. The function should return a grid represented as a 2D list of characters, where:

*   `'R'` represents a residential zone.
*   `'C'` represents a commercial hub.
*   `'P'` represents a park.
*   `'I'` represents an infrastructure node.
*   `'.'` represents an empty cell.

The goal is to maximize the city's overall happiness score.  While finding the absolute optimal solution may be computationally infeasible, your solution should strive to achieve a high happiness score within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).

**Input Format:**

```python
def solve_city_planning(N: int, R: int, C: int, P: int, I: int, commercial_weight: int, park_weight: int, infrastructure_weight: int) -> List[List[str]]:
    # Your code here
    pass
```

**Output Format:**

```
List[List[str]]: A 2D list representing the city grid.
```

**Example:**

```
N = 5
R = 3
C = 2
P = 1
I = 1
commercial_weight = 50
park_weight = 30
infrastructure_weight = 10

# Possible output (the actual output should maximize the happiness score):
[
    ['.', 'R', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', 'C', '.', 'P'],
    ['.', 'C', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['R', '.', '.', 'I', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'R']
]
```

**Judging:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the happiness score it achieves on a set of hidden test cases.  Test cases will vary in size (`N`), number of buildings (`R`, `C`, `P`, `I`), and weights (`commercial_weight`, `park_weight`, `infrastructure_weight`).  Solutions that violate the constraints will be considered incorrect. Efficiency and the ability to balance the competing objectives will be key to achieving a high score.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using heuristics or approximation algorithms to find a good, but not necessarily optimal, solution.
*   Explore different placement strategies for each type of building, considering their impact on the overall happiness score.
*   Think about how to efficiently calculate distances and the maximum distance to infrastructure nodes.
*   Local search or simulated annealing could be useful.
*   Start with a simple initial placement and iteratively improve it.
*   Efficiently implementing distance calculations will be crucial for performance.

## Question: Optimal Train Route Scheduling

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal train route scheduling system for a large railway network. The network consists of `N` stations and `M` railway tracks connecting these stations. Each track has a *capacity* (maximum number of trains allowed simultaneously), a *length* (in kilometers), and a *speed limit* (in km/h).

A set of `K` trains needs to be scheduled. Each train has a *departure station*, a *destination station*, a *departure time*, and a *priority* (an integer value, higher means more important). Trains cannot overtake each other on a track.

Your goal is to determine the departure time for each train at each intermediate station along its route such that the overall *weighted average travel time* of all trains is minimized. The weight for each train is its *priority*.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The railway network is represented as a directed graph. Each station is a node, and each track is a directed edge. There can be multiple tracks between two stations (parallel edges), each with potentially different properties. The graph may not be fully connected.
2.  **Capacity:** At any given time, the number of trains on a track cannot exceed its capacity. A train enters a track at its departure station and exits at its destination station. You must ensure capacity constraints are respected at all times.
3.  **Speed Limit:** Trains must adhere to the speed limit of each track.
4.  **Route Selection:** For each train, you are given a fixed route (a sequence of stations it must visit). You are not allowed to change the route.
5.  **Non-Overtaking:** Trains cannot overtake each other on a track. If train A enters a track before train B, train A must exit the track before train B.
6.  **Departure Time Constraint:** Each train has a *earliest departure time* from the origin.

**Input:**

*   `N` (number of stations): Integer
*   `M` (number of tracks): Integer
*   `K` (number of trains): Integer
*   Stations are numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   Tracks: A list of tuples `(start_station, end_station, capacity, length, speed_limit)`.
*   Trains: A list of tuples `(departure_station, destination_station, earliest_departure_time, priority, route)`. The route is a list of stations representing the sequence of stations the train must visit, including the departure and destination stations. The departure station is the first element of the route, and the destination station is the last.

**Output:**

A dictionary (or similar data structure in your chosen language) where:

*   The key is the train index (0 to K-1).
*   The value is a list of timestamps (floats) representing the departure time of the train from each station along its route, including the origin. Timestamps should be in chronological order for each train.

If no valid schedule exists that satisfies all constraints, return `None`.

**Optimization Goal:**

Minimize the weighted average travel time of all trains. The travel time of a train is the difference between its arrival time at the destination station and its departure time from the origin station.

Weighted Average Travel Time = `sum(priority_i * travel_time_i) / sum(priority_i)` for all trains `i`.

**Example:**

Let's say you have 2 trains:

* Train 1: Departure = Station 0, Destination = Station 2, Earliest Departure Time = 0, Priority = 10, Route = \[0, 1, 2]
* Train 2: Departure = Station 0, Destination = Station 2, Earliest Departure Time = 5, Priority = 5, Route = \[0, 1, 2]

A possible (but not necessarily optimal) schedule would be:

* Train 1: \[0.0, 1.0, 2.0] (Departs 0 at 0.0, departs 1 at 1.0, departs 2 at 2.0)
* Train 2: \[5.0, 6.0, 7.0] (Departs 0 at 5.0, departs 1 at 6.0, departs 2 at 7.0)

**Grading Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the solution produce a valid schedule that satisfies all constraints?
*   **Optimality:** How close is the solution to the optimal weighted average travel time?  Solutions will be graded based on their relative performance compared to other submissions.
*   **Efficiency:** How quickly does the solution run, especially as the input size increases? Solutions should be reasonably efficient.
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

**Hints:**

*   Consider using graph algorithms like shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's) as a starting point for finding routes, but remember the routes are fixed in this problem.
*   This is an optimization problem, so you might consider using techniques like dynamic programming, linear programming, or search algorithms (e.g., A*, simulated annealing) to find a good solution.
*   Think carefully about how to represent time and track occupancy on the tracks.
*   Start with a simple, brute-force approach to get a working solution, and then optimize it.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   Consider using data structures that allow for efficient lookups and updates.

This problem requires careful consideration of multiple factors and can be quite challenging to solve optimally. Good luck!

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Orchestration

You are building a distributed system that processes financial transactions. These transactions can involve multiple independent services, such as `AccountService`, `FraudDetectionService`, and `NotificationService`. To ensure data consistency across these services, you need to implement a distributed transaction management system.

Each transaction consists of a series of operations performed by the individual services. If any operation fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain atomicity.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Definition:** A transaction is defined by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent operations performed by a specific service, and edges represent dependencies between these operations. For example, `AccountService.debit` might need to complete successfully before `FraudDetectionService.verify` can start.

2.  **Service Operations:** Each service operation is an asynchronous function that accepts a transaction ID and a payload as input. It returns `True` on success and `False` on failure.  You are given a dictionary mapping service names to service operation functions.

3.  **Transaction Orchestration:** Implement a function `orchestrate_transaction(transaction_graph, services, initial_payload)` that takes the transaction graph (DAG), the service dictionary, and an initial payload. This function should execute the transaction by traversing the DAG.

4.  **Atomicity:** If any service operation fails (returns `False`), the `orchestrate_transaction` function must initiate a rollback procedure.  The rollback procedure involves calling a corresponding "compensating transaction" function for each completed operation in the *reverse* order of execution.  Each service has a corresponding compensating transaction function that reverses the effects of a transaction. It also accepts the transaction ID and payload. You are given another dictionary mapping service names to service compensating transaction functions.

5.  **Idempotency:**  Service operations and compensating transactions may be called multiple times.  Ensure your implementation handles this.  You can assume each service keeps its own record of transactions processed or compensated. No need to implement this in your code, just assume it is a given.

6.  **Concurrency:** Multiple transactions can be executed concurrently.  Ensure your solution is thread-safe. You can use thread locks and other synchronization primitives to avoid race conditions.

7.  **Error Handling:** Log any failures of service operations or compensating transactions, but do not stop the orchestrator.  The orchestrator should attempt to rollback as many operations as possible, even if some compensations fail.

8.  **Optimization:** Minimize the overall execution time of transactions. Consider how to parallelize the execution of independent operations within the transaction graph where dependencies allow.

9. **Monitoring:** Implement the function to record the execution states of each operation. You can use a dictionary to store the state of each node in the DAG. The states can be "pending", "running", "completed", "failed", "compensated", "compensate_failed"

**Input:**

*   `transaction_graph`: A dictionary representing the DAG. Keys are operation IDs (strings), and values are dictionaries with keys `'service'` (string, service name), `'operation'` (string, operation name), and `'dependencies'` (list of operation IDs that must complete before this operation can start).

*   `services`: A dictionary mapping service names (strings) to dictionaries. Each inner dictionary maps operation names (strings) to asynchronous functions (accepting transaction ID and payload).

*   `compensating_transactions`: A dictionary mapping service names (strings) to dictionaries. Each inner dictionary maps operation names (strings) to asynchronous compensating transaction functions (accepting transaction ID and payload).

*   `initial_payload`: A dictionary representing the initial payload for the transaction.

**Output:**

*   A dictionary where keys are operation IDs from the `transaction_graph` and values are their final states ("completed", "failed", "compensated", "compensate_failed").

**Constraints:**

*   The transaction graph is a valid DAG.
*   Service operations and compensating transactions are asynchronous.
*   Handle concurrent transactions safely.
*   The transaction ID should be unique. You can generate one with `uuid.uuid4()`.
*   All functions should be implemented in Python.
*   Focus on the core logic of transaction orchestration and rollback.

This problem requires you to combine knowledge of graph traversal, asynchronous programming, distributed systems concepts, and concurrency control. Good luck!

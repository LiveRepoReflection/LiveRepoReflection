def optimize_circuit(num_qubits, circuit, coupling_map, max_swaps, swap_noise):
    """
    Baseline implementation of a quantum circuit optimizer.
    
    This function takes a quantum circuit represented as a list of gate tuples and returns
    an optimized circuit by potentially inserting SWAP gates with the goal of minimizing
    the cumulative noise along the critical path. The critical path is defined as the
    sequence of gates with the highest accumulated noise.

    This baseline solution does not perform any real optimization. It preserves
    the order and logical operation of the original circuit by returning it unchanged.
    This is a valid solution for cases where no swaps are needed, and it respects the
    provided constraints (e.g., not inserting more than max_swaps SWAPs).

    Parameters:
        num_qubits (int): Number of qubits in the quantum computer.
        circuit (list of tuples): Original circuit. Each tuple is in the format
                                  (qubit1, qubit2, gate_type, noise_level). For single-qubit
                                  gates, qubit2 is -1.
        coupling_map (list of tuples): List of pairs (qubit_a, qubit_b) indicating physical
                                       connectivity between qubits.
        max_swaps (int): Maximum number of SWAP gates allowed.
        swap_noise (float): Noise level introduced by each SWAP gate.

    Returns:
        list of tuples: Optimized circuit with swaps inserted if beneficial. The optimized circuit
                        maintains the order of the original gates.

Okay, here's a problem description designed to be challenging, sophisticated, and open to multiple valid approaches with varying trade-offs, similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

### Question Description

You are given two grayscale images, `ImageA` and `ImageB`, represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer represents the pixel intensity (0-255). The images are potentially of different sizes.  Your task is to find the optimal alignment of a rectangular region within `ImageA` to a corresponding region within `ImageB`, maximizing a specific similarity score while ensuring the alignment is robust to noise and minor distortions.

Specifically, you need to implement a function `find_optimal_alignment(image_a, image_b, region_width, region_height, search_radius)`.

**Input:**

*   `image_a`: A 2D list of integers representing the first grayscale image.
*   `image_b`: A 2D list of integers representing the second grayscale image.
*   `region_width`: The width of the rectangular region to be aligned.
*   `region_height`: The height of the rectangular region to be aligned.
*   `search_radius`:  An integer representing the maximum horizontal and vertical distance (in pixels) to search for the best alignment. For example, a `search_radius` of 5 means you should search within a (2\*5 + 1) x (2\*5 + 1) window around the initial expected position.  The expected position is defined as the top-left corner (0,0) in `ImageB` for the region to be aligned from `ImageA`.

**Output:**

A tuple `(row_offset, col_offset, similarity_score)`.

*   `row_offset`: The row offset (positive or negative) representing the vertical shift of the aligned region in `ImageB` relative to the top-left corner (0,0).
*   `col_offset`: The column offset (positive or negative) representing the horizontal shift of the aligned region in `ImageB` relative to the top-left corner (0,0).
*   `similarity_score`:  The maximum similarity score achieved between the aligned regions of `ImageA` and `ImageB`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Image Boundaries:** The aligned region in `ImageB` *must* remain entirely within the bounds of `ImageB`.  If any part of the region falls outside the image boundaries, the alignment is invalid and should *not* be considered. The region in `ImageA` should also remain entirely within the bounds of `ImageA`.
2.  **Similarity Score:** Use Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) as the similarity score. NCC is defined as:

    NCC = Î£<sub>x,y</sub> [(A(x,y) - mean(A)) * (B(x+row_offset, y+col_offset) - mean(B))] / [std_dev(A) * std_dev(B) * region_width * region_height]

    Where:
    * A(x,y) is the pixel intensity at (x,y) in the region from ImageA.
    * B(x+row_offset, y+col_offset) is the pixel intensity at (x + row_offset, y + col_offset) in the region from ImageB.
    * mean(A) and mean(B) are the mean pixel intensities of the respective regions.
    * std_dev(A) and std_dev(B) are the standard deviations of the pixel intensities of the respective regions.
    * x and y iterate over the `region_width` and `region_height` respectively.

    A higher NCC score indicates a better alignment.  NCC scores range from -1 to 1.
3.  **Robustness:** Implement a small optimization to improve robustness to minor intensity variations:  Before calculating NCC, subtract the median pixel intensity from both the region in `ImageA` and the candidate region in `ImageB`. This will normalize the images and make them less sensitive to overall brightness differences.
4.  **Optimization:** The naive approach of calculating NCC for every possible offset within the `search_radius` will likely be too slow for larger images and `search_radius` values. Optimize your solution to reduce redundant calculations. Think about using techniques like memoization or exploiting properties of the NCC calculation.
5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases gracefully, such as:
    *   Empty images.
    *   `region_width` or `region_height` being larger than the image dimensions.
    *   `search_radius` being 0.
    *   No valid alignment possible (return `(0, 0, -float('inf'))` in this case).
6.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should aim for a time complexity better than O(image_width * image_height * region_width * region_height * search_radius^2). While achieving a perfect theoretical minimum may be difficult, strive for practical efficiency through intelligent algorithm design and data structure choices.
7. **Numerical Stability:** Implement the NCC calculation in a numerically stable way, preventing potential issues with division by zero (if `std_dev(A)` or `std_dev(B)` is zero) or other floating-point inaccuracies. If either standard deviation is zero, consider the NCC score for that offset as -1.

**Example:**

```python
image_a = [[100, 110, 120],
           [130, 140, 150],
           [160, 170, 180]]

image_b = [[90, 100, 110],
           [120, 130, 140],
           [150, 160, 170]]

region_width = 2
region_height = 2
search_radius = 1

row_offset, col_offset, similarity_score = find_optimal_alignment(image_a, image_b, region_width, region_height, search_radius)

# Expected Output (approximate - results may vary slightly due to floating point precision):
# row_offset = 0
# col_offset = 0
# similarity_score = 0.9999999999999998
```

**Note:** This problem requires a solid understanding of image processing concepts, algorithm design, and optimization techniques. It encourages the use of appropriate data structures and careful handling of edge cases. The constraints are designed to push candidates to think beyond a brute-force solution and consider efficiency and robustness.

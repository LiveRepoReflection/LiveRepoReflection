## The Inter-Dimensional Cable Network Routing Problem

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a new inter-dimensional cable network. This network connects *N* different dimensions. Each dimension is represented by a unique integer ID from 0 to *N*-1. Travel between dimensions is possible via bidirectional "wormholes." However, wormholes are unstable and only exist during specific, non-overlapping time intervals. Furthermore, traveling through a wormhole takes a non-negligible amount of time.

You are given the following information:

*   **N**: The number of dimensions.
*   **wormholes**: A list of wormholes, where each wormhole is represented by a tuple: `(dimension_A, dimension_B, start_time, end_time, travel_time)`.
    *   `dimension_A`: The ID of the starting dimension.
    *   `dimension_B`: The ID of the destination dimension.
    *   `start_time`: The time at which the wormhole becomes active.
    *   `end_time`: The time at which the wormhole becomes inactive.
    *   `travel_time`: The time it takes to travel through the wormhole.
*   **start_dimension**: The ID of the starting dimension.
*   **end_dimension**: The ID of the destination dimension.
*   **departure_time**: The time at which you begin your journey from the start dimension.

Your goal is to find the minimum time required to travel from the `start_dimension` to the `end_dimension`, starting no earlier than the `departure_time`. You can wait in a dimension indefinitely if no wormhole is currently available. You can only travel through a wormhole if you arrive at `dimension_A` at or after `start_time` and before `end_time`.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 1000
*   0 <= dimension_A, dimension_B < N
*   0 <= start_time < end_time <= 10<sup>9</sup>
*   1 <= travel_time <= 10<sup>9</sup>
*   0 <= departure_time <= 10<sup>9</sup>
*   The number of wormholes is at most 10000.
*   It is possible to have multiple wormholes between the same two dimensions with different time intervals.
*   A wormhole connects two distinct dimensions (dimension_A != dimension_B).
*   If there is no path between the `start_dimension` and the `end_dimension`, return -1.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large values of *N* and a large number of wormholes.  Consider the time complexity of your algorithm.
*   Avoid unnecessary computations or memory usage.

**Example:**

```python
N = 5
wormholes = [
    (0, 1, 0, 10, 2),  # Dimension 0 to 1, available from time 0 to 10, travel time 2
    (1, 2, 5, 15, 3),  # Dimension 1 to 2, available from time 5 to 15, travel time 3
    (2, 3, 12, 20, 4),  # Dimension 2 to 3, available from time 12 to 20, travel time 4
    (0, 4, 2, 8, 1),    # Dimension 0 to 4, available from time 2 to 8, travel time 1
    (4, 3, 7, 15, 2)     # Dimension 4 to 3, available from time 7 to 15, travel time 2
]
start_dimension = 0
end_dimension = 3
departure_time = 1

# Expected Output: 9
# Explanation:
# 1. Start at dimension 0 at time 1.
# 2. Take wormhole from dimension 0 to dimension 4 (available from 2 to 8), travel time 1.  Arrive at dimension 4 at time 1 + 1 = 2.
# 3. Wait at dimension 4 until time 7.
# 4. Take wormhole from dimension 4 to dimension 3 (available from 7 to 15), travel time 2.  Arrive at dimension 3 at time 7 + 2 = 9.
```

**Multiple Valid Approaches and Trade-offs:**

Consider different graph traversal algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) and how they handle the time-dependent nature of the wormholes. Think about how to efficiently represent the network and the wormhole availability. Some approaches might be faster for certain types of wormhole distributions but slower for others.

Good luck!

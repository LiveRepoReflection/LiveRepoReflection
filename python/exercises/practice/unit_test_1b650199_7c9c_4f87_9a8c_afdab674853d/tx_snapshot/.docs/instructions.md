Okay, here's a challenging coding problem description, designed to be intricate and demanding.

## Question Title: Distributed Transaction Manager with Snapshot Isolation

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction manager (DTM) that supports snapshot isolation. This DTM will coordinate transactions across multiple independent data shards (simulated in-memory).  The goal is to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties, specifically focusing on snapshot isolation.

**System Architecture:**

Imagine a system with a single central DTM and `N` data shards. Each shard holds a key-value store, where both keys and values are strings.  The DTM is responsible for coordinating transactions that may involve multiple shards.

**Transaction Model:**

Transactions consist of a series of read and write operations on the data shards. Each transaction is assigned a unique transaction ID (TID) by the DTM when it begins.  A read operation specifies a key and shard ID, and the DTM must return the value of that key from the specified shard (or indicate that the key does not exist). A write operation specifies a key, value, and shard ID, and the DTM must update the value of that key in the specified shard.  The DTM supports `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` operations.

**Snapshot Isolation Requirements:**

1.  **Snapshot Reads:** When a transaction begins, it is assigned a snapshot ID (SID) which is equal to the current global timestamp. All read operations performed by the transaction must read data as it existed at the transaction's SID. This ensures that each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data, regardless of concurrent updates.

2.  **Write Conflicts:**  When a transaction attempts to commit, the DTM must check for write conflicts. A write conflict occurs if any of the keys written by the transaction have been modified by another transaction that committed *after* the transaction's SID but *before* the current time. If a write conflict is detected, the transaction must be rolled back.

3.  **Timestamp Ordering:** The DTM must maintain a global, monotonically increasing timestamp to assign SIDs and track the commit time of transactions.

**Specific Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Data Shards:** You will simulate data shards using in-memory dictionaries. Each shard will be represented as a Python dictionary where keys and values are strings.

2.  **DTM Interface:**  Implement the following methods in your DTM:
    *   `begin_transaction()`:  Assigns a new TID and SID (timestamp) to the transaction and registers the transaction as active.
    *   `read(tid, shard_id, key)`: Returns the value of the key from the specified shard as of the transaction's SID. Returns `None` if the key does not exist in the snapshot.
    *   `write(tid, shard_id, key, value)`: Records the write operation (key, value, shard ID) for the transaction.  The write is not applied to the shard immediately.
    *   `commit_transaction(tid)`: Attempts to commit the transaction. Checks for write conflicts. If no conflicts are found, applies the writes to the shards, records the commit timestamp, and returns `True`. If conflicts are found, rolls back the transaction and returns `False`.
    *   `rollback_transaction(tid)`: Rolls back the transaction, discarding any pending writes.

3.  **Concurrency:** Your solution must be thread-safe to handle concurrent transactions. Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

4.  **Optimization:** Optimize your solution for read performance. Reading data from a snapshot should be as efficient as possible.  Consider how you will store historical data to support snapshot reads without excessive memory consumption.

**Input/Output:**

The problem is to implement the DTM class and its methods, not to read from standard input or write to standard output.  Your solution will be tested by creating instances of the DTM, starting and executing transactions, and verifying the correctness of reads and writes after commits and rollbacks.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The number of data shards (`N`) can be large (up to 1000).
*   Transactions can be long-running and involve many read and write operations.
*   The system must handle concurrent transactions correctly.
*   Consider the case where a key is written multiple times within the same transaction.
*   Consider the case where a key is deleted (set to `None`) within a transaction.
*   The solution should be memory efficient. Avoid storing unnecessary copies of data.
*   The DTM must handle potential deadlocks in a reasonable manner (e.g., by rolling back one of the conflicting transactions).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does the DTM correctly implement snapshot isolation and handle concurrent transactions?
*   **Performance:** Is the read performance optimized? Is the overall performance acceptable for a large number of shards and transactions?
*   **Concurrency:** Is the solution thread-safe and free from race conditions?
*   **Memory Usage:** Is the memory footprint of the solution reasonable?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem is designed to be extremely challenging, requiring a deep understanding of distributed systems, concurrency control, and data structures. Good luck!

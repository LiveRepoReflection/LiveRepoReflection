**Network Vulnerability Analysis**

## Question Description

You are a security analyst tasked with identifying vulnerabilities in a simulated network. The network consists of interconnected devices, each with a specific configuration and potential weaknesses. Your goal is to analyze the network graph, identify critical paths, and determine the overall risk score based on the vulnerabilities present.

**Input:**

The network is represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents a device, and each directed edge represents a network connection.

Each device has the following attributes:

*   **`device_id`**: A unique string identifier for the device.
*   **`device_type`**: A string representing the type of device (e.g., "router", "server", "workstation").
*   **`os_version`**: A string representing the operating system version (e.g., "Windows Server 2019", "Ubuntu 20.04").
*   **`open_ports`**: A list of integers representing the open network ports on the device (e.g., \[22, 80, 443]).
*   **`vulnerabilities`**: A list of vulnerability scores, each an integer in the range \[1-10], representing severity based on CVSS score (Common Vulnerability Scoring System). A higher score indicates a more severe vulnerability.

The network graph is provided as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple `(source_device_id, destination_device_id)`.

**Vulnerability Scoring:**

The risk score of a device is calculated as the sum of its vulnerability scores.

**Critical Path:**

A critical path is defined as a path in the network graph from a designated "entry point" device to a designated "target" device with the highest possible cumulative vulnerability score across all devices in the path. If there are multiple target devices, the critical path should be calculated for each. The entry point is always a device exposed to the public internet (e.g., a web server, a VPN gateway).

**Constraints:**

1.  The network can contain cycles.
2.  There can be multiple paths between any two devices.
3.  The vulnerability scores are independent of the device type or OS version.
4.  You need to find the critical path with the **maximum sum of device vulnerability scores** from the entry point to **any** of the potential target devices.
5.  If no path exists between the entry point device and any target device, the critical path score is 0.
6.  The vulnerability scores of the entry and target point devices should be included in the final path score.
7.  If there are multiple paths with the same highest vulnerability score, return the shortest of them.

**Task:**

Write a function that takes the following inputs:

*   `devices`: A dictionary where the keys are `device_id` strings and the values are dictionaries containing the device attributes (`device_type`, `os_version`, `open_ports`, `vulnerabilities`).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the directed edges in the network graph.
*   `entry_point`: The `device_id` of the entry point device.
*   `target_devices`: A list of `device_id` strings representing the target devices.

The function should return a tuple containing:

1.  The highest vulnerability score observed along any critical path.
2.  A list of `device_id` strings representing the critical path (from entry point to target). If no path exists, return an empty list.

**Example:**

```python
devices = {
    "A": {"device_type": "web_server", "os_version": "Linux", "open_ports": [80, 443], "vulnerabilities": [3, 5]},
    "B": {"device_type": "application_server", "os_version": "Windows", "open_ports": [8080], "vulnerabilities": [7, 2]},
    "C": {"device_type": "database_server", "os_version": "Linux", "open_ports": [3306], "vulnerabilities": [9]},
    "D": {"device_type": "workstation", "os_version": "Windows", "open_ports": [139, 445], "vulnerabilities": [1, 4]}
}
edges = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("A", "D")]
entry_point = "A"
target_devices = ["C", "D"]

# Expected output: (26, ['A', 'B', 'C'])

```

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient in terms of time complexity, especially for large networks. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   Avoid unnecessary computations or redundant traversals of the network graph.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution should accurately identify the critical path and calculate the highest vulnerability score.
*   Efficiency: The solution should be efficient in terms of time complexity, especially for large networks.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Handling Edge Cases: The solution should handle edge cases gracefully, such as disconnected networks, cycles, and invalid input.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal algorithms, dynamic programming (or similar optimization techniques), and careful consideration of edge cases. Good luck!

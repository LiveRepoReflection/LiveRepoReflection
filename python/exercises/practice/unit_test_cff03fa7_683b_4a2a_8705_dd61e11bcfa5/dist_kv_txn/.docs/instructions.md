## Problem: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed key-value store that supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for transactions.  The system consists of `N` nodes, where `N` can be a relatively small number (e.g., 3-7). Your implementation will focus on ensuring transactional integrity rather than high throughput.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Key-Value Store:** Implement a basic key-value store interface with `get(key)` and `put(key, value)` operations.  Keys and values are strings.

2.  **Transactions:** Implement a transaction API with `begin()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` operations. All operations (get, put) must occur within a transaction.

3.  **Atomicity:** All operations within a transaction must either succeed or fail as a single unit. If any operation within a transaction fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back, leaving the system in its original state.

4.  **Consistency:** Transactions must maintain the consistency of the data. You don't need to enforce any complex data validation rules, but ensure that a transaction moves the system from one valid state to another.

5.  **Isolation:** Implement snapshot isolation. Each transaction should operate on a consistent snapshot of the data, and concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other.  Readers should never block writers, and writers should not block readers.

6.  **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes must be durable, even in the face of node failures. You need to implement a mechanism for ensuring durability across the distributed nodes.

**Specific Constraints and Challenges:**

*   **Distributed Consensus:** You must use a consensus algorithm (e.g., Paxos or Raft - you can use a simplified version for this problem) to ensure that all nodes agree on the order of transactions and the commit/rollback decisions. You do not need to implement the full Paxos/Raft algorithm; a simplified multi-round commit protocol that guarantees consensus under certain failure scenarios is acceptable. Assume a minority of nodes can fail.
*   **Snapshot Isolation Implementation:** Consider how to efficiently manage snapshots of the key-value store for each transaction. Think about techniques like copy-on-write or multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
*   **Concurrency Control:**  Handle concurrent transactions. You need to detect and resolve potential conflicts between transactions (e.g., two transactions trying to update the same key).
*   **Node Failures:**  The system must be resilient to a limited number of node failures. Committed transactions must remain durable, and the system should be able to recover from node failures without data loss. Assume fail-stop failures.
*   **Optimization:** Minimize the latency of transaction commit operations. Consider techniques like batching or pipelining to improve performance.
*   **Scalability (stretch goal):** Briefly outline how your design could be extended to handle a larger number of nodes and higher transaction rates. You don't need to implement these extensions, but demonstrate an understanding of the challenges involved.

**Input/Output:**

Your solution should provide a Python API with the following methods:

*   `initialize(node_id, all_node_ids)`: Initializes a node in the distributed key-value store. `node_id` is a unique identifier for the node, and `all_node_ids` is a list of all node IDs in the cluster.
*   `begin()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a transaction ID.
*   `get(tx_id, key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a key within a specific transaction. Returns `None` if the key does not exist in the snapshot visible to the transaction.
*   `put(tx_id, key, value)`: Updates the value associated with a key within a specific transaction.
*   `commit(tx_id)`: Attempts to commit the transaction. Returns `True` if the commit succeeds, `False` if the commit fails (e.g., due to a conflict or node failure).
*   `rollback(tx_id)`: Rolls back the transaction.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Your solution must correctly implement the key-value store and transaction APIs, ensuring ACID properties.
*   **Robustness:** Your solution must be resilient to node failures and concurrency conflicts.
*   **Efficiency:** Your solution should minimize the latency of transaction commit operations.
*   **Code Quality:** Your code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Design Rationale:**  You should provide a clear explanation of your design choices, including the consensus algorithm you used, how you implemented snapshot isolation, and how you handle concurrency and node failures.

This problem is designed to be open-ended and challenging. There are many possible solutions, and the best solutions will demonstrate a deep understanding of distributed systems principles and trade-offs.  Good luck!

## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication in a Microservice Architecture

You are designing the communication layer for a distributed microservice architecture. You have `N` microservices, each represented by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. These services need to communicate with each other via remote procedure calls (RPC).

However, direct RPC calls between all services are inefficient and lead to high latency. To optimize communication, you will implement a **hierarchical routing system** using a **k-ary tree**.

**Problem Statement:**

1.  **k-ary Tree Structure:** The `N` microservices are the leaf nodes of a complete k-ary tree. Internal nodes of the tree act as routers. Each router has a maximum of `k` children. The root node (router) is at level 0, and the leaf nodes (services) are at the deepest level `L`.

2.  **Routing Mechanism:** When service `A` (leaf node) needs to communicate with service `B` (leaf node), the message follows this path:
    *   From `A` up to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) router node.
    *   From the LCA router node down to `B`.

3.  **Router Capacity:** Each router (internal node) has a limited capacity `C`, representing the maximum number of messages it can process concurrently. If a router's capacity is exceeded, new messages are dropped, leading to communication failures.

4.  **Traffic Matrix:** You are given a traffic matrix `T` of size `N x N`, where `T[i][j]` represents the number of messages service `i` needs to send to service `j` within a given time window.

**Your Task:**

Write a function that determines the **minimum value of the router capacity `C`** required to ensure that **no messages are dropped** during inter-service communication, given the number of services `N`, the tree branching factor `k`, and the traffic matrix `T`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1024` (N is a power of k, i.e., N = k^L for some integer L)
*   `2 <= k <= 10`
*   `0 <= T[i][j] <= 100` for all `0 <= i, j < N`
*   Your solution must be efficient, with a time complexity significantly better than O(N^3), aiming for something closer to O(N^2 log N) or better.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
k = 2
T = [
    [0, 5, 2, 1],
    [8, 0, 3, 7],
    [4, 6, 0, 2],
    [5, 1, 9, 0]
]

# Expected Output: (Explanation would involve tracing message paths and finding the max load on any router)

```

**Note:**  The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the load on each router based on the traffic matrix and the tree structure, and then determining the minimum capacity that can handle the maximum load.  Consider how to avoid redundant calculations and leverage properties of the k-ary tree to achieve optimal performance. You will need to determine the data structure for representing the K-ary tree. How to efficiently find the Least Common Ancestor? How do you trace the path from one leaf to another?

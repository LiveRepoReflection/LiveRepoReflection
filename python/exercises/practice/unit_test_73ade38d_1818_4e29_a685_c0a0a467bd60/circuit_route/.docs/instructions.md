Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating the elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `OptimalCircuitRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for integrated circuits.  Given a rectangular grid representing a circuit board, with dimensions `rows x cols`, and a set of `n` components that need to be connected. Each component `i` has a designated starting point `start_i` and ending point `end_i` on the grid.

The connections must be established using wires that can only run horizontally or vertically along the grid lines. Wires cannot occupy the same grid cell simultaneously (except at the start and end points of components). Each grid cell can only be used by one wire segment, unless it is the starting/ending point of the components.

Your goal is to find a routing solution that minimizes the **maximum wire length** among all the components. In other words, you need to connect all components in such a way that the longest individual wire used is as short as possible.

**Input:**

*   `rows`: An integer representing the number of rows in the grid.
*   `cols`: An integer representing the number of columns in the grid.
*   `components`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(start, end)` represents a component. `start` and `end` are tuples representing the `(row, col)` coordinates of the starting and ending points of the component, respectively. Coordinates are 0-indexed.
*   `blocked`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(row, col)` represent the blocked grid location, which cannot be used for routing.

**Output:**

*   Return the minimum possible value for the maximum wire length among all components, or `-1` if no valid routing is possible.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Grid:** The grid size can be up to `100 x 100`.
*   **Many Components:** The number of components `n` can be up to `20`.
*   **Optimization:** The primary goal is to minimize the maximum wire length, not the total wire length.  A solution that uses slightly more total wire but reduces the maximum wire length is preferred.
*   **No Overlap (Mostly):** Wires cannot overlap, except at the start and end points of the components.
*   **Blocked Cells:** Some cells in the grid are blocked and cannot be used for routing.
*   **Real-World Analogy:** This problem mirrors the challenges of routing signals in hardware design, where minimizing the longest signal path is crucial for performance.
*   **Efficiency:** Brute-force approaches will likely time out.  Consider efficient algorithms and data structures.
*   **Multiple Approaches:** There might be multiple valid routing solutions. Your algorithm should find one that minimizes the maximum wire length.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where components start and end at the same point, no solution exists, invalid input, or a cell is blocked.

**Example:**

```python
rows = 5
cols = 5
components = [((0, 0), (4, 4)), ((0, 4), (4, 0))]
blocked = []

# A possible solution might involve finding paths for each component.

# The expected output would be the minimum possible maximum wire length
# among all components in a valid routing.
```

This problem combines graph search, optimization, and careful consideration of constraints, making it a challenging task suitable for a high-level programming competition. Good luck!

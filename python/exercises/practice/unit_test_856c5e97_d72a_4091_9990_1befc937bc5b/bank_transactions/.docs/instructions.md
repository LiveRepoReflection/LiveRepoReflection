Okay, here's a coding problem designed to be challenging, incorporating the elements you requested.

**Problem:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for a simplified banking system. The system consists of `N` banks (where `1 <= N <= 1000`), each managing its own local account balances.  Transactions involve transferring funds between accounts that may reside in different banks. To ensure data consistency across all banks, you need to implement the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

Each bank has a unique ID from 1 to N. Account numbers are unique system-wide.

**Input:**

Your program will receive a list of transactions. Each transaction is represented as a string with the following format:

`"transaction_id,source_account,destination_account,amount"`

Where:

*   `transaction_id` is a unique integer identifying the transaction.
*   `source_account` is the account number to debit.
*   `destination_account` is the account number to credit.
*   `amount` is the amount of money to transfer.

You are also given a dictionary representing the initial state of each bank. This dictionary maps bank ID to a dictionary of account balances in that bank. For example:

```python
initial_state = {
    1: { "account_1": 100, "account_2": 50 },
    2: { "account_3": 200, "account_4": 75 }
}
```

This means bank 1 has account_1 with a balance of 100 and account_2 with a balance of 50. Bank 2 has account_3 with a balance of 200 and account_4 with a balance of 75.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Account Location:** You need to determine which bank holds each account involved in a transaction. Assume you have a function `get_bank_for_account(account_number)` that returns the bank ID that holds a given account number.  This function is assumed to be fast and reliable.

2.  **Transaction Coordinator:** Implement the 2PC protocol. Your coordinator should:

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):**  For each transaction, send a "prepare" message to all banks involved (banks holding either the source or destination account). Each bank should attempt to tentatively apply the transaction (debit the source, credit the destination - if the bank has both source and destination account).  If the bank has sufficient funds in the source account and no other errors occur, it should log the tentative changes and respond with "vote_commit". If the bank cannot prepare (e.g., insufficient funds, account not found), it should respond with "vote_abort".
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):** Based on the votes received from all involved banks, the coordinator decides whether to commit or rollback the transaction. If all banks voted to commit, the coordinator sends a "commit" message to all involved banks. If any bank voted to abort, the coordinator sends a "rollback" message to all involved banks. Banks should then either permanently apply the changes (commit) or undo the tentative changes (rollback).

3.  **Atomicity:**  The core goal is to ensure that either all involved banks commit the transaction, or all roll back. No partial commits are allowed.

4.  **Isolation:** Implement a simple locking mechanism at each bank to prevent concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.  A bank should acquire a lock before attempting to prepare a transaction and release it after committing or rolling back.  Consider the possibility of deadlocks and implement a basic deadlock prevention strategy (e.g., acquire locks in a consistent order based on account number).

5.  **Durability:**  Assume each bank has a persistent log where it records tentative and final transaction decisions. You don't need to implement actual file I/O, but you need to ensure that your data structures reflect the state that *would* be stored in such a log.  Specifically, banks must be able to recover their state if they crash and restart (you don't need to simulate crashes, just demonstrate the ability to recover).

6.  **Error Handling:**  Handle potential errors gracefully, such as:

    *   Insufficient funds
    *   Account not found
    *   Invalid transaction format
    *   Bank failure (assume a bank can fail during any phase of the 2PC protocol â€“ you don't need to explicitly simulate failures, but your code should be resilient to them).

7.  **Optimization:** Minimize the number of messages exchanged between the coordinator and the banks. While correctness is paramount, strive for efficiency.

**Output:**

Your program should return a list of transaction results. Each result should be a dictionary with the following keys:

*   `transaction_id`: The ID of the transaction.
*   `status`:  Either "committed" or "aborted".
*   `final_state`: A dictionary representing the final state of each bank *after* processing all transactions, in the same format as the `initial_state`.

**Constraints:**

*   Assume `get_bank_for_account()` is an external function you cannot modify.
*   The number of banks `N` is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
*   The number of transactions can be large (up to 10,000).
*   Account balances are integers.
*   The amount to transfer is always a positive integer.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Does your solution correctly implement the 2PC protocol and guarantee atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability?
*   **Efficiency:**  Is your solution reasonably efficient in terms of message passing and resource usage?
*   **Robustness:**  Does your solution handle errors gracefully and recover from potential failures?
*   **Code Quality:**  Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and error handling. It is designed to be challenging and open-ended, allowing for multiple valid approaches with varying trade-offs in terms of complexity and performance. Good luck!

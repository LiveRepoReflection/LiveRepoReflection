Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a strong programmer.

**Problem Title:**  Optimal Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing the delivery routes for a logistics company operating in a large city.  The company has multiple depots scattered throughout the city, each with a limited number of vehicles and a finite total capacity.  The company needs to deliver goods to a set of customers, each with a specific demand and a defined time window during which the delivery *must* occur.

Each depot has a fleet of identical vehicles, each with a fixed capacity. Each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle from one depot. The objective is to minimize the total travel cost (distance) of all routes while satisfying all demands and time window constraints.

More formally:

*   **Input:**
    *   `Depots`: A list of depot locations, each with:
        *   `location`: (x, y) coordinates representing its location in the city.
        *   `vehicle_count`: The number of vehicles available at this depot.
        *   `vehicle_capacity`: The maximum capacity of each vehicle.
    *   `Customers`: A list of customer locations, each with:
        *   `location`: (x, y) coordinates representing its location in the city.
        *   `demand`: The amount of goods that must be delivered to this customer.
        *   `time_window_start`: The earliest time a delivery can be made.
        *   `time_window_end`: The latest time a delivery can be made.
    *   `Travel Time Matrix`: A matrix containing travel times (or distances, assuming constant speed) between all locations (depots and customers). `travel_time[i][j]` represents the travel time from location `i` to location `j`. You can treat it as Euclidean distance.

*   **Output:**
    A list of routes, where each route is associated with a depot and consists of an ordered list of customer IDs to visit. Specifically, an output should be structured as:

    ```
    {
        "depot_id": Integer, // The index of the depot in the `Depots` list.
        "routes": [
            [customer_id1, customer_id2, customer_id3, ...], // Route 1
            [customer_id4, customer_id5, ...], // Route 2
            ...
        ]
    }
    ```

    Where `customer_id` refers to the index of the customer in the `Customers` list.

*   **Constraints:**

    *   **Capacity Constraints:** The total demand served by any vehicle route cannot exceed the vehicle capacity of the originating depot.
    *   **Time Window Constraints:** Each customer must be visited within their specified time window.  If a vehicle arrives *before* the time window opens, it must wait until the time window starts before serving the customer.  If a vehicle arrives *after* the time window ends, the solution is invalid.
    *   **Vehicle Count Constraint:** The number of routes originating from each depot cannot exceed the number of vehicles available at that depot.
    *   **Each customer must be visited exactly once.**

*   **Optimization Goal:**

    Minimize the total travel time (or distance) across all routes.

*   **Complexity Considerations:**

    *   The number of depots, customers, and vehicles can be large (up to hundreds or thousands).
    *   The time window constraints can be narrow, making it difficult to find feasible solutions.
    *   The problem is NP-hard.  Finding the absolute optimal solution might be computationally infeasible for large instances. Therefore, focus on developing a high-quality heuristic solution within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 minutes).

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   Travel times are symmetric (travel_time[i][j] == travel_time[j][i]).
    *   Service time at each customer is negligible (can be ignored).
    *   Vehicles can return to the depot after completing their route.  Returning to the depot is mandatory.

*   **Scoring:** The solutions will be scored based on the total travel time. Lower travel time scores better. Solutions that violate any constraint will be considered invalid and receive a score of zero.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure proficiency, and optimization techniques to develop a solution that is both feasible and efficient.  Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed with the criteria you specified.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Consensus with Limited Bandwidth**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a distributed database system where transactions need to be committed across multiple nodes. However, due to network constraints, the bandwidth between nodes is severely limited and asymmetric.  Nodes have varying computational power. You are tasked with implementing a consensus algorithm that ensures atomicity and consistency of transactions while minimizing network traffic and taking into account node heterogeneity.

Specifically, you are given:

*   **N nodes:** Each node has a unique ID (1 to N).
*   **Transactions:** A stream of transactions arrives at the system. Each transaction involves a subset of nodes and has a unique transaction ID. A transaction must either be committed on *all* participating nodes or *aborted* on all participating nodes.
*   **Bandwidth Matrix:** A matrix `B[i][j]` representing the maximum bandwidth available for communication *from* node `i` *to* node `j`. `B[i][j]` might not equal `B[j][i]`. A value of 0 indicates no direct connection.
*   **Computational Capacity:** A list `C[i]` representing the computational capacity of node `i`. This is a relative measure (e.g., number of operations per second).  Higher values indicate greater computational power.
*   **Message Size:** Each consensus message (e.g., votes, commit/abort decisions) has a fixed size `S`.
*   **Latency:** The latency between two nodes `i` and `j` is assumed to be proportional to the inverse of bandwidth `1/B[i][j]` if `B[i][j] > 0`, and infinite if `B[i][j] == 0`.
*   **Node Failure:** Nodes can fail at any time. You need to design a fault-tolerant consensus mechanism. Assume that a majority of nodes will always be functional.

Your task is to implement a system that:

1.  **Proposes Transactions:** Design a mechanism for a node to propose a transaction.
2.  **Reaches Consensus:** Implements a fault-tolerant consensus algorithm (e.g., a variant of Paxos or Raft or a novel approach) that commits or aborts the transaction across all participating nodes, respecting the bandwidth constraints and node capacities. You should avoid flooding the network with messages.
3.  **Handles Failures:**  Deals with node failures gracefully. If a node fails during the consensus process, the system should still be able to reach a decision and maintain consistency.
4.  **Optimizes for Throughput:** Aims to maximize the number of transactions committed per unit of time.

**Constraints:**

*   Minimize the total bandwidth consumed by the consensus algorithm for each transaction.
*   Consider the computational capacity of each node when assigning roles (e.g., leader election in Raft). A powerful node should be preferred as a leader.
*   Prioritize committing transactions quickly.
*   The algorithm must be resilient to node failures.
*   The number of messages exchanged per transaction should be minimized.
*   The solution should be scalable to a large number of nodes.
*   The solution should be able to cope with both large and small transactions (transactions involving a few nodes vs. transactions involving many nodes).
*  Asymmetric network latency should be handled appropriately.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Does the system correctly commit or abort transactions and maintain consistency across all nodes?
*   **Throughput:**  How many transactions can the system commit per unit of time?
*   **Bandwidth Utilization:**  How much bandwidth is consumed per committed transaction?
*   **Fault Tolerance:** How quickly does the system recover from node failures?
*   **Scalability:**  How well does the system perform as the number of nodes increases?
*   **Complexity:** Assess the algorithmic complexity of your solution.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, consensus algorithms, network constraints, and optimization techniques. A well-designed solution will need to carefully balance these factors to achieve high throughput and fault tolerance with limited bandwidth. Good luck!

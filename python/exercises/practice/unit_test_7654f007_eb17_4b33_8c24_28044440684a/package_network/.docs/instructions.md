## Question: Optimizing Inter-City Package Delivery Network

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimized delivery network for a national logistics company, "SwiftTransit". SwiftTransit operates a fleet of vehicles to deliver packages between cities across the country. Due to fluctuating fuel costs, varying traffic conditions, and dynamic package volumes, the company needs a system that can adapt and optimize delivery routes in real-time.

The country is represented as a graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent cities, each identified by a unique integer ID from 0 to `N-1`, where N is the total number of cities.
*   **Edges:** Represent direct routes between cities. Each route has the following attributes:
    *   `distance`: The physical distance between the two cities (in kilometers).
    *   `base_cost`: A base cost associated with using the route, representing tolls, maintenance, etc.
    *   `traffic_factor`: A real number between 0.5 and 2.0 (inclusive) representing the current traffic condition. A value of 1.0 indicates normal traffic. Values below 1.0 indicate lighter traffic, and values above 1.0 indicate heavier traffic.
    *   `fuel_price_factor`: A real number between 0.8 and 1.2 (inclusive) representing the current fuel price for the city at the origin of the route.

The **cost** of traversing a route is calculated as follows:

`route_cost = distance * base_cost * traffic_factor * fuel_price_factor`

SwiftTransit has a central depot located in city `0`. Every day, packages need to be delivered from city `0` to a set of destination cities.

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of cities.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a directed edge in the form `(city_u, city_v, distance, base_cost, traffic_factor, fuel_price_factor)`.
*   `destination_cities`: A list of city IDs that must receive deliveries from the central depot (city `0`).

Your task is to design an algorithm to find the **minimum total cost** required to deliver packages to all the `destination_cities`, starting from city `0`.  A single vehicle can deliver to multiple cities within a single route if it is cost effective.

**Constraints:**

1.  The vehicle **must** return to the central depot (city `0`) after delivering to all specified destination cities.
2.  A destination city can be visited multiple times.
3.  The total number of cities `N` is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
4.  The number of edges is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
5.  The number of destination cities is in the range `[1, N-1]`.
6.  The distance between cities is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
7.  The base cost of a route is in the range `[1, 10]`.
8.  Your solution should be optimized for both time and space complexity. A brute-force approach will not pass all test cases.
9.  It is guaranteed that there is at least one path from the depot (city 0) to each destination city and back.

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of cities.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a directed edge in the form `(city_u, city_v, distance, base_cost, traffic_factor, fuel_price_factor)`.
*   `destination_cities`: A list of integers representing the IDs of the destination cities.

**Output:**

*   A single floating-point number representing the minimum total cost required to deliver packages to all destination cities and return to the depot.  The result should be rounded to two decimal places.

**Example:**

```python
N = 4
edges = [
    (0, 1, 10, 1, 1.0, 1.0),  # city_u, city_v, distance, base_cost, traffic_factor, fuel_price_factor
    (0, 2, 15, 1.5, 1.2, 0.9),
    (1, 2, 5, 2, 0.8, 1.1),
    (1, 3, 12, 1, 1.5, 1.0),
    (2, 3, 8, 1, 0.9, 1.2),
    (3, 0, 20, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0)
]
destination_cities = [1, 3]

# Expected output:  A float representing the minimal cost to deliver packages to cities 1 and 3 and return to city 0.
# (Calculation is complex and depends on the algorithm chosen, but an optimal solution might involve going 0->1->3->0 or 0->3->1->0)
```

**Note:** This problem requires careful consideration of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and potentially dynamic programming to achieve the best possible solution within the given constraints.

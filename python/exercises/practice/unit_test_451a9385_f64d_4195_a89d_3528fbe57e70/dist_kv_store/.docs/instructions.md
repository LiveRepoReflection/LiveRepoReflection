Okay, here is a challenging and sophisticated coding problem for a high-level programming competition, focusing on graph manipulation and optimization.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Conflict Resolution

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transactional key-value store. The system consists of `N` nodes, where `N` can be a large number (up to 10,000). Clients can send transaction requests to any node. Each transaction can involve multiple key-value pairs and can span multiple nodes.

**Data Model:**  The key-value store uses string keys and integer values.

**Transactions:**  Transactions must be ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  Transactions can involve `get`, `put`, and `delete` operations on key-value pairs.

**Conflict Resolution:**  Due to the distributed nature of the system, concurrent transactions might conflict. You must implement a deadlock-free conflict resolution mechanism.  Implement a distributed locking mechanism (e.g., 2 Phase Commit or Paxos based locking) to ensure serializability.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Transactions:** Transactions can read and write data across multiple nodes.
2.  **Concurrency Control:**  Implement a mechanism to handle concurrent transactions and prevent data corruption. Aim for high throughput and low latency.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:**  The system should be resilient to node failures.  Data replication is required for durability. Assume a fail-stop model (nodes either work correctly or crash). Implement replication such that the system can tolerate up to `F` node failures, where `F` is a configurable parameter.
4.  **Scalability:**  The system should scale to handle a large number of nodes and transactions.
5.  **Performance:**  Minimize latency for transaction commits and rollbacks.  Maximize throughput.
6.  **Deadlock Prevention:** Your locking mechanism must be deadlock-free.

**Input Format:**

The system will receive a stream of transaction requests.  Each request will be a list of operations. An operation can be one of the following:

*   `GET <key>`:  Read the value associated with `<key>`.
*   `PUT <key> <value>`: Write `<value>` to `<key>`.
*   `DELETE <key>`: Delete the `<key>` and its associated value.
*   `COMMIT`: Commit the transaction.
*   `ROLLBACK`: Rollback the transaction.

Each transaction is initiated implicitly with the first operation after a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.

**Output Format:**

For each `GET` operation, the system should output the current value of the key. If the key does not exist, output "NULL".

For `COMMIT` operations, output "COMMIT OK". For `ROLLBACK` operations, output "ROLLBACK OK".

**Constraints:**

*   `N` (number of nodes): 1 <= N <= 10,000
*   `F` (number of tolerable node failures): 0 <= F < N
*   Key length: 1 <= length(key) <= 100 characters (alphanumeric)
*   Value range: -2<sup>31</sup> <= value <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
*   Number of operations per transaction: 1 <= operations <= 100
*   The system must handle a high volume of concurrent transactions.
*   Assume reliable message passing between nodes.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:**  The system must correctly implement ACID properties.
2.  **Performance:**  The system must achieve high throughput and low latency.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:**  The system must tolerate node failures as specified by the `F` parameter.
4.  **Scalability:**  The system should demonstrate scalability with increasing numbers of nodes and transactions.
5.  **Code Quality:**  The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a consistent hashing scheme to distribute keys across nodes.
*   Implement a distributed locking mechanism to ensure serializability. 2PC is a classical choice. Paxos or Raft based locking can be considered for its fault-tolerance.
*   Implement data replication to ensure durability.
*   Optimize for read and write performance.  Consider caching strategies.
*   Carefully handle edge cases and potential race conditions.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

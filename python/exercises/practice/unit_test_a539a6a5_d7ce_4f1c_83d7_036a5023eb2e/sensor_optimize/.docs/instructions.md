`Distributed Sensor Network Optimization`

## Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing a distributed sensor network deployed across a large geographical area. The network consists of `N` sensor nodes, each with limited battery life and communication range. The sensors are responsible for detecting and reporting events of interest to a central base station.

The area is divided into `M` regions. Each region `i` has a certain importance score `importance[i]` representing the critical nature of monitoring events in that region. A region is considered *covered* if at least `K` distinct sensors can directly communicate with it.

Each sensor `j` has a battery level `battery[j]` (initially at 100) and a communication range `range[j]`. Sensors consume battery power for both sensing and communication.

The network operates in discrete time steps. At each time step, each sensor must make a decision: either *sense* or *sleep*.

*   **Sense**: If a sensor chooses to *sense*, it consumes 1 unit of battery. If the sensor's location falls within a region, it contributes to the coverage of that region.
*   **Sleep**: If a sensor chooses to *sleep*, it consumes no battery. It does not contribute to the coverage of any region.

Communication between a sensor and a region is possible if the Euclidean distance between the sensor's location and the region's center is less than or equal to the sensor's communication range.

**Objective:**

Design an algorithm that maximizes the total importance score of covered regions over a given time horizon `T`, while ensuring that no sensor's battery level drops below zero.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of sensors.
*   `M`: The number of regions.
*   `K`: The minimum number of distinct sensors required to cover a region.
*   `T`: The time horizon (number of time steps).
*   `sensor_locations`: A list of tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of each sensor.
*   `sensor_ranges`: A list of integers representing the communication range of each sensor.
*   `region_locations`: A list of tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of the center of each region.
*   `region_importances`: A list of integers representing the importance score of each region.

**Output:**

A list of lists, where each inner list represents the actions of each sensor at each time step. `actions[t][j]` should be either `0` (sleep) or `1` (sense), representing the action of sensor `j` at time step `t`.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 500
*   1 <= M <= 200
*   1 <= K <= 10
*   1 <= T <= 200
*   0 <= x, y <= 1000 (for sensor and region locations)
*   1 <= sensor_ranges[j] <= 200
*   1 <= region_importances[i] <= 100
*   Battery levels must never be negative.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should aim to maximize the total importance score of covered regions over the entire time horizon.
*   The solution should be computationally efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few minutes).

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Regions with no sensors within communication range.
*   Sensors with very limited range or battery.
*   High `K` values making it difficult to cover regions.
*   Conflicting sensor locations requiring strategic action choices.

This problem requires a blend of algorithmic thinking (potentially dynamic programming or greedy approaches combined with heuristics), careful consideration of constraints, and the ability to handle multiple edge cases.  The large solution space necessitates a focus on optimization. Good luck!

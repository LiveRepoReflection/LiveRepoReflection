Okay, here's a challenging problem description:

**Project Name:** `PersistentAnalytics`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for collecting and analyzing a continuous stream of user events. The system must handle a large volume of events, provide real-time analytics capabilities, and ensure data persistence even in the face of system failures.

Specifically, you need to implement a class, `AnalyticsEngine`, that satisfies the following requirements:

1.  **Event Ingestion:** The `AnalyticsEngine` should have a method `record_event(user_id, event_type, timestamp, data)`. This method receives a user ID (integer), an event type (string), a timestamp (integer representing Unix time in seconds), and arbitrary event data (a dictionary). The engine must efficiently store this event data.

2.  **Real-time Aggregation:** The `AnalyticsEngine` must provide a method `get_aggregate(metric, window_size, start_time, end_time)`. This method calculates an aggregate metric over a specified time window.

    *   `metric` (string): Specifies the aggregation to perform. Supported metrics are:
        *   `"event_count"`:  Counts the total number of events within the window.
        *   `"unique_users"`:  Counts the number of unique user IDs within the window.
        *   `"average_data_value"`: Calculates the average value of a specific field in the event data across all events in the window. The method also receive the field name to calculate the average. `get_aggregate(metric="average_data_value", window_size, start_time, end_time, field_name)`. If the field is not present in the event's data, ignore that event from average calculation.
    *   `window_size` (integer): Specifies the time window size in seconds.
    *   `start_time` (integer): The starting timestamp (inclusive) of the time window.
    *   `end_time` (integer): The ending timestamp (inclusive) of the time window.

3.  **Persistence:** The `AnalyticsEngine` must persist event data to disk to prevent data loss in case of system failures. You must implement a `load_data()` method to restore the data from the disk and a `save_data()` method to save the data to disk. The persistence mechanism should be efficient, minimizing read/write operations.

4.  **Scalability:** The `record_event()` method should have a low latency and high throughput to handle a large volume of incoming events. The `get_aggregate()` method should provide results quickly, even when querying over large time windows.

5.  **Constraints:**

    *   The system should be optimized for read-heavy workloads (many `get_aggregate()` calls compared to `record_event()` calls).
    *   The timestamp values are always non-decreasing.
    *   The time window size can vary from seconds to days.
    *   The available memory is limited. Assume the entire dataset cannot fit in memory simultaneously.
    *   Disk I/O should be minimized where possible.
    *   The number of unique users can be very large.
    *   The average_data_value field will always be numeric if present.

6. **Disk space:** The disk space is also limited, so you can't keep infinite event history. The system should delete the oldest events after 30 days of the current event timestamp.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   Correctness: Accurate implementation of event recording and aggregation.
*   Performance: Efficiency of event ingestion and query processing.
*   Scalability: Ability to handle a large volume of events and a large number of unique users.
*   Persistence: Reliable data persistence and recovery.
*   Code quality: Readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
*   Efficiency of data storage.

This problem requires a combination of data structure selection, algorithm design, and system design considerations to achieve optimal performance and scalability. Good luck!

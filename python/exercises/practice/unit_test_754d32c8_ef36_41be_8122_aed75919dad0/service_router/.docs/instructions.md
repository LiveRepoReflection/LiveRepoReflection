## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication in a Microservices Architecture

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient inter-service communication mechanism for a large-scale microservices architecture. The system consists of `N` microservices, labeled from `0` to `N-1`.  Each service needs to periodically send requests to other services to perform its tasks. However, direct communication between all pairs of services is not feasible due to network bandwidth limitations and the overhead of managing numerous connections.

To optimize communication, a central message broker is employed. Each service sends its requests to the broker, and the broker routes these requests to the appropriate destination service(s). Your goal is to design a routing algorithm for the message broker that minimizes the overall latency of inter-service communication.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Service Dependencies:** The dependencies between services are represented as a directed graph. The graph is provided as a list of tuples `dependencies`, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` indicates that service `u` needs to send `w` messages to service `v` within a given time window.

2.  **Broker Routing Policies:** The message broker supports two routing policies:

    *   **Direct Routing:** The broker directly forwards messages from the source service to the destination service. The latency for each message is `D`.

    *   **Group Routing:** The broker can group messages destined for the same service from multiple source services and send them together. However, grouping introduces an additional latency overhead `G` for each group formed. This overhead is independent of the number of messages grouped. The latency for each grouped message becomes `D + G/number_of_messages`.

3.  **Constraints:**

    *   The number of services `N` can be up to 10<sup>4</sup>.
    *   The number of dependencies can be up to 10<sup>5</sup>.
    *   The number of messages `w` between any two services can be up to 10<sup>3</sup>.
    *   `D` and `G` are positive integers less than or equal to 10<sup>3</sup>.
    *   Each service can send messages to multiple other services.
    *   Each service can receive messages from multiple other services.
    *   The broker can choose either direct routing or group routing for each destination service independently.

4.  **Objective:** Minimize the total latency for all inter-service communication. The total latency is the sum of latencies for each message sent, considering the chosen routing policy (direct or group) for each destination service.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of microservices (integer).
*   `dependencies`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)`, where:
    *   `u`: Source service ID (integer, 0 <= u < N).
    *   `v`: Destination service ID (integer, 0 <= v < N).
    *   `w`: Number of messages from service `u` to service `v` (integer).
*   `D`: Direct routing latency (integer).
*   `G`: Group routing overhead (integer).

**Output:**

A single integer representing the minimum total latency achievable across all inter-service communication.

**Example:**

```
N = 3
dependencies = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 8)]
D = 2
G = 5
```

**Explanation of Example:**

*   Service 0 sends 10 messages to service 1.
*   Service 0 sends 5 messages to service 2.
*   Service 1 sends 8 messages to service 2.

**Possible Strategies:**

*   **Service 1:** Direct routing is optimal (10 * 2 = 20).
*   **Service 2:** We have two options:
    *   Direct routing: (5 * 2) + (8 * 2) = 10 + 16 = 26
    *   Group routing: (5 + 8) * (2 + 5/13) = 13 * (2 + 0.38) = 13 * 2.38 = 30.94 (approximately 31).  Round up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the minimum total latency is 20 + 26 = 46 (choosing direct routing for service 2).

**Challenge:**

Develop an efficient algorithm to determine the optimal routing policy (direct or group) for each destination service to minimize the overall communication latency, given the constraints and the sizes of the inputs. Focus on algorithmic efficiency because your code will be tested against large inputs.

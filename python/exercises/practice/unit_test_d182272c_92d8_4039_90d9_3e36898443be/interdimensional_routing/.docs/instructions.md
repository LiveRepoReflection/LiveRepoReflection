Okay, here is a challenging problem description for a high-level programming competition.

## The Interdimensional Cable Network

**Problem Description:**

You are designing the routing infrastructure for the Interdimensional Cable Network (ICN), a futuristic communication system that allows instant data transfer between parallel universes. The ICN consists of interconnected routers scattered across different dimensions. Each router has a unique ID (an integer), and the connection between two routers has a specific latency value (also an integer) that represents the time it takes for data to travel between them.

However, reality is not always stable. At any given time, some dimensions might be experiencing "temporal anomalies." These anomalies cause data corruption, represented by a certain level of "instability." Each router residing in a dimension with temporal anomalies has an instability value associated with it.

The ICN needs to provide a reliable communication path between any two routers, minimizing both the latency of the path and the total instability encountered along the way. Formally, given a source router `S` and a destination router `D`, the goal is to find a path between `S` and `D` that minimizes the following cost function:

```
Cost = Total_Latency + K * Total_Instability
```

where:

*   `Total_Latency` is the sum of the latencies of all connections used in the path.
*   `Total_Instability` is the sum of the instability values of all routers visited along the path (including the source and destination).
*   `K` is a global constant representing the "instability penalty factor." It determines the trade-off between latency and instability.

**Input:**

*   A list of routers. Each router is represented by its ID (integer) and, if residing in a dimension with temporal anomalies, its instability value (integer). If the router is not in a dimension with temporal anomalies, its instability value is 0.
*   A list of connections. Each connection is represented by a tuple: `(router_id_1, router_id_2, latency)`.
*   The ID of the source router `S`.
*   The ID of the destination router `D`.
*   The instability penalty factor `K` (integer).

**Output:**

*   The minimum cost of a path between `S` and `D`, as defined above. If no path exists between `S` and `D`, return -1.
*   The path should be a list of router IDs, ordered from the source to the destination. If no path exists between `S` and `D`, return an empty list. If multiple paths exist with the same minimum cost, return any one of them.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of routers can be up to 1000.
*   The number of connections can be up to 5000.
*   Router IDs are unique and within the range \[1, 10000].
*   Latency values are positive integers within the range \[1, 100].
*   Instability values are non-negative integers within the range \[0, 100].
*   The instability penalty factor `K` is a positive integer within the range \[1, 100].
*   The graph of routers and connections is undirected (i.e., a connection `(A, B, L)` implies a connection `(B, A, L)`).
*   The graph might not be fully connected.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints. A naive approach might lead to timeouts.
*   Consider optimizing for both time and space complexity.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   `S` and `D` are the same router.
*   No path exists between `S` and `D`.
*   The graph is disconnected.
*   The input graph contains cycles.
*   A very large value of K, where you would always try to avoid the instability.
*   A very small value of K, where you would always try to have the minimum latency.

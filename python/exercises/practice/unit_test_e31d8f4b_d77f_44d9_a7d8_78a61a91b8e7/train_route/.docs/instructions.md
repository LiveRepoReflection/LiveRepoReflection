## Project Name: Optimal Train Route Planner

### Question Description:

You are tasked with designing an optimal train route planner for a national railway network. The network consists of a set of cities connected by railway tracks. Each railway track has a specific length, speed limit, and maintenance cost. The train company wants to find the fastest and most cost-effective route between two given cities, considering several constraints.

**Input:**

*   **Cities:** A list of cities in the railway network, represented by unique string identifiers (e.g., "New York", "Los Angeles").
*   **Tracks:** A list of railway tracks, where each track is defined by:
    *   `start_city`: The starting city of the track.
    *   `end_city`: The ending city of the track.
    *   `length`: The length of the track in kilometers (positive float).
    *   `speed_limit`: The maximum speed allowed on the track in kilometers per hour (positive float).
    *   `maintenance_cost`: The cost to use the track, based on length in currency units (positive float).
    *   `is_scenic`: A boolean indicating whether the track offers scenic views.
*   **Start City:** The city where the train route begins (string).
*   **Destination City:** The city where the train route ends (string).
*   **Budget:** The maximum budget allowed for the route (positive float).
*   **Time Limit:** The maximum time allowed for the route in hours (positive float).
*   **Penalty:** A float representing penalty per city visited.

**Output:**

Return the optimal train route as a list of city identifiers in the order they are visited, including the start and destination cities. If no valid route exists within the given constraints, return an empty list.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The railway network should be modeled as a graph, where cities are nodes and railway tracks are edges. Consider using an adjacency list or adjacency matrix representation.
2.  **Multi-Criteria Optimization:** The route should be optimized for both time and cost. The primary goal is to minimize travel time while staying within the budget.
3.  **Budget Constraint:** The total maintenance cost of the chosen route must not exceed the given `budget`.
4.  **Time Constraint:** The total travel time of the chosen route must not exceed the given `time_limit`.
5.  **Cycle Detection:** The route must not contain cycles (i.e., the train cannot visit the same city more than once).
6.  **Scenic Routes Preference (Optional):** If multiple routes satisfy the time and budget constraints, the route with more scenic tracks should be preferred. (This is a tie-breaker.)
7.  **Penalty for City Visits:** The train company wants to encourage direct routes. Visiting a city incurs a penalty to the total cost. This penalty is defined by a penalty per city visited.
8.  **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient and scalable, especially for large railway networks (hundreds or thousands of cities and tracks). Consider using appropriate algorithms for pathfinding and optimization.
9.  **Real-World Considerations:** The solution should handle realistic scenarios, such as disconnected networks (where no route exists between the start and destination cities), multiple possible routes, and varying track conditions (length, speed limit, cost).

**Example:**

Let's say you have three cities, "A", "B", and "C", connected by tracks:

*   A -> B: length = 100 km, speed\_limit = 100 km/h, maintenance\_cost = 50, is\_scenic = True
*   B -> C: length = 150 km, speed\_limit = 75 km/h, maintenance\_cost = 75, is\_scenic = False
*   A -> C: length = 200 km, speed\_limit = 120 km/h, maintenance\_cost = 100, is\_scenic = True

If the start city is "A", the destination city is "C", the budget is 160, the time limit is 3 hours, and the penalty is 10, the optimal route would be A -> C, because A -> B -> C exceeds the budget even if A -> B is cheaper than A -> C, but it is less time. The penalty of a city visit is factored in.

**Note:** This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and data structures. You might consider using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, A\* search, or dynamic programming to find the optimal route. However, you will need to adapt these algorithms to handle the multiple constraints and optimization criteria.

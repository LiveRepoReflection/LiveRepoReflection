Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test a range of skills.

**Project Title:**  Autonomous Vehicle Route Optimization and Collision Avoidance

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are developing the core routing and safety system for an autonomous vehicle fleet operating in a dynamic, partially mapped urban environment.  Your task is to design and implement a system that efficiently determines the optimal (shortest) path between two points for a given vehicle, while simultaneously ensuring collision avoidance with both static obstacles (buildings, parked cars) and other moving vehicles in the fleet.

**Input:**

1.  **Map Data:**  A graph representation of the city. Nodes represent intersections or significant points along roads, and edges represent road segments. Each edge has a 'length' (distance) attribute and a 'speed_limit' attribute. The graph is provided as a dictionary where keys are node IDs (integers), and values are lists of tuples representing connected nodes and edge attributes:

    ```python
    graph = {
        0: [(1, {'length': 100, 'speed_limit': 30}), (2, {'length': 150, 'speed_limit': 25})],
        1: [(0, {'length': 100, 'speed_limit': 30}), (3, {'length': 200, 'speed_limit': 40})],
        2: [(0, {'length': 150, 'speed_limit': 25}), (4, {'length': 100, 'speed_limit': 35})],
        3: [(1, {'length': 200, 'speed_limit': 40}), (5, {'length': 120, 'speed_limit': 30})],
        4: [(2, {'length': 100, 'speed_limit': 35}), (5, {'length': 180, 'speed_limit': 45})],
        5: [(3, {'length': 120, 'speed_limit': 30}), (4, {'length': 180, 'speed_limit': 45})]
    }
    ```

2.  **Vehicle Data:** A list of dictionaries, each representing a vehicle in the fleet. Each vehicle has the following attributes:

    *   `vehicle_id`: A unique integer identifier for the vehicle.
    *   `current_location`:  The ID of the node where the vehicle is currently located.
    *   `destination`: The ID of the node the vehicle needs to reach.
    *   `speed`: The current speed of the vehicle (meters per second).
    *   `safety_radius`:  A radius (in meters) around the vehicle that must be kept clear of other vehicles.
    *   `acceleration_rate`: The maximum acceleration rate (meters per second squared) of the vehicle.

    ```python
    vehicles = [
        {'vehicle_id': 1, 'current_location': 0, 'destination': 5, 'speed': 10, 'safety_radius': 15, 'acceleration_rate': 2},
        {'vehicle_id': 2, 'current_location': 2, 'destination': 3, 'speed': 5, 'safety_radius': 10, 'acceleration_rate': 3}
    ]
    ```

3.  **Static Obstacles:** A list of node IDs representing static obstacles. Vehicles cannot traverse these nodes.

    ```python
    static_obstacles = [6, 7] # Nodes that do not exist in the graph
    ```

**Output:**

A dictionary where the key is the `vehicle_id`, and the value is a list of node IDs representing the optimal route for that vehicle, considering both path length and collision avoidance.  If a route cannot be found for a vehicle (e.g., no path to destination, or unsolvable collision avoidance), the value should be `None`.

```python
{
    1: [0, 1, 3, 5],  # Example route for vehicle 1
    2: [2, 0, 1, 3]   # Example route for vehicle 2
}
```

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Optimal Path:** The route must be the shortest possible path, considering the `length` attribute of the edges.  You can use algorithms like Dijkstra's or A\*.
2.  **Collision Avoidance:** The route must ensure that no two vehicles will be within each other's `safety_radius` at any point during their journeys. Assume vehicles will maintain their current speed unless they need to slow down to avoid a collision or speed up to the road's speed limit.  Vehicles can only accelerate up to the `acceleration_rate`. You need to consider the time it takes for each vehicle to traverse each edge.
3.  **Dynamic Planning:**  The routing must be dynamic. After determining the initial routes, simulate the vehicles moving along their routes for a short time interval (e.g., 1 second).  Re-evaluate the routes based on the new vehicle positions. Repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 10 iterations). This simulates a real-time re-routing system.
4.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no path exists between the start and end nodes, or where collision avoidance is impossible.
5.  **Efficiency:**  The routing algorithm must be efficient.  The graph can be large (thousands of nodes and edges), and the number of vehicles in the fleet can be significant.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
6.  **Realistic Assumptions:**  Assume vehicles can instantaneously change lanes within a road segment to avoid obstacles, but cannot deviate from the defined graph structure. Assume vehicles know the location and speed of all other vehicles in the fleet.
7.  **Prioritization:** If a vehicle is blocked by another vehicle, the vehicle with lower `vehicle_id` has the priority to continue moving. Other vehicles should find alternative route.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness (Does the code produce valid routes that avoid collisions?)
*   Optimality (Are the routes as short as possible?)
*   Efficiency (Does the code run quickly, even with large graphs and many vehicles?)
*   Code Clarity and Style (Is the code well-organized, readable, and well-commented?)
*   Handling Edge Cases (Does the code gracefully handle cases where no solution exists?)

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, pathfinding, collision detection, and simulation. Good luck!

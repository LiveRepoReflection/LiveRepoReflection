## Project Name

`Decentralized Social Network Graph Traversal`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a graph traversal algorithm for a decentralized social network. In this network, user data and connections are not stored in a central database but are distributed across multiple nodes (servers) in a peer-to-peer fashion. Each node holds information about a subset of users and their direct connections (friends).

**Data Distribution:**

Each node in the network maintains a partial view of the social graph. Specifically, each node knows:

*   A set of user IDs it "owns." This means the node possesses the complete profile information for these users.
*   For each user it owns, a list of their direct friend (user ID) connections. These friends may or may not be owned by the same node.

**Problem Statement:**

Given a starting user ID (`start_user_id`) and a target user ID (`target_user_id`), your goal is to find the shortest path (minimum number of hops) between these two users in the decentralized social network.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Decentralized Data:** You cannot assume access to a complete graph representation. You can only query individual nodes to retrieve user information and connections.
2.  **Node Querying:** You have a function `get_node(user_id)` that takes a `user_id` as input and returns the node that owns the corresponding user's profile. If no node owns the user, it returns `None`.
3.  **Node API:** Each node object has a method `get_friends(user_id)` that returns a list of user IDs representing the direct friends of `user_id`. If the `user_id` is not owned by the node, it returns an empty list.
4.  **Network Latency:** Network calls to `get_node(user_id)` are expensive operations and should be minimized.
5.  **Scalability:** The solution should be efficient enough to handle a large social network with millions of users and nodes.  Consider the potential for a very high branching factor (many friends per user).
6.  **Optimality:** Find the *shortest* path.  If multiple shortest paths exist, any one is acceptable.
7.  **Error Handling:** If either `start_user_id` or `target_user_id` does not exist in the network (i.e., `get_node()` returns `None`), return `None`. If no path exists between the users, return `None`.
8.  **Cycle Detection:** The graph may contain cycles. Your algorithm must handle cycles gracefully to avoid infinite loops.
9.  **Memory Constraints:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with a large social network.
10. **Time Complexity:** Aim for the best possible time complexity, considering the distributed nature of the data.  Justify your time complexity analysis in your comments.

**Input:**

*   `start_user_id`: An integer representing the ID of the starting user.
*   `target_user_id`: An integer representing the ID of the target user.

**Output:**

*   A list of user IDs representing the shortest path from `start_user_id` to `target_user_id`, inclusive of the start and target. Return `None` if no path exists or if either user doesn't exist.

**Example:**

Let's say:

*   `Node1` owns users `[1, 2, 3]` and has connections: `1: [2, 3], 2: [1, 4], 3: [1]`
*   `Node2` owns users `[4, 5, 6]` and has connections: `4: [2, 5], 5: [4, 6], 6: [5]`

If `start_user_id = 1` and `target_user_id = 6`, a possible shortest path is `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.

**Clarifications:**

*   Assume user IDs are unique integers.
*   You can assume the existence of the `get_node(user_id)` function and the `Node` class with the `get_friends(user_id)` method.  You do *not* need to implement these.
*   Focus on the pathfinding algorithm itself. The implementation of the distributed network infrastructure is outside the scope of this problem.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph traversal algorithms, distributed systems considerations, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithms, optimization, and edge-case handling, similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a cost-effective network path through a distributed data center. The data center consists of `n` servers, labeled from `0` to `n-1`. The servers are interconnected by a network of fiber optic cables.

The network topology is represented as a directed graph, where each edge represents a fiber optic cable connecting two servers. The edges are given as a list of tuples: `edges = [(u, v, cost, bandwidth), ...]`, where:

*   `u` is the source server (integer).
*   `v` is the destination server (integer).
*   `cost` is the cost of using the cable (integer).
*   `bandwidth` is the available bandwidth of the cable (integer).

You are given a source server `start_server` and a destination server `end_server`.  You are also given a minimum required bandwidth `min_bandwidth`.

Your goal is to find the path from `start_server` to `end_server` that minimizes the total cost while ensuring that *every* cable on the path has at least `min_bandwidth` available.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Large Network:** The data center can have a large number of servers (e.g., `n <= 10^5`) and edges (e.g., number of edges <= `3 * 10^5`).  The server IDs will be in the range `[0, n-1]`.
2.  **Realistic Costs and Bandwidths:**  Costs and bandwidths are positive integers, but can vary significantly (e.g., `1 <= cost <= 10^6`, `1 <= bandwidth <= 10^6`).
3.  **Multiple Paths:** There can be multiple paths between the `start_server` and `end_server`.  Your solution must find the *lowest cost* path that meets the bandwidth requirement.
4.  **No Path:** If there is no path that meets the bandwidth requirement, return `-1`.
5.  **Efficiency:**  Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large networks within a reasonable time limit (e.g., within a few seconds).  Consider time complexity.
6.  **Memory Considerations:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially given the potential size of the network.
7.  **Edge Case:** If `start_server` and `end_server` are the same, and there exists at least one outgoing edge from `start_server` with `bandwidth >= min_bandwidth`, the cost should be 0. If there are no such edges, return -1.

**Input:**

*   `n`:  The number of servers (integer).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the network topology: `[(u, v, cost, bandwidth), ...]`
*   `start_server`: The starting server (integer).
*   `end_server`: The destination server (integer).
*   `min_bandwidth`: The minimum required bandwidth (integer).

**Output:**

*   The minimum total cost of a path from `start_server` to `end_server` that meets the bandwidth requirement, or `-1` if no such path exists (integer).

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

## Project Name

`OptimalRoutePlanner`

## Question Description

You are developing a route planning service for a delivery company operating in a dense urban environment. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are intersections and edges are street segments. Each street segment has a travel time (in seconds) associated with it, which can vary depending on the time of day due to traffic.

The delivery company has a fleet of drones. Each drone has a maximum flight time `max_flight_time` (in seconds) before it needs to return to the depot for recharging.

You are given a set of delivery tasks, each with a pickup location, a delivery location, and a time window (start_time, end_time) within which the delivery *must* be completed. Both pickup and delivery location are represented by the intersection node IDs. The time window is defined in seconds since the start of the day (0 seconds).

Your task is to write a function `find_optimal_routes(graph, delivery_tasks, depot_location, max_flight_time, time_dependent_travel_times)` that finds a set of routes, one for each delivery task, such that:

1.  Each delivery task is completed within its specified time window.
2.  Each drone starts from the depot (`depot_location`), flies to the pickup location, then to the delivery location, and finally returns to the depot.
3.  The total flight time for each route (depot -> pickup -> delivery -> depot) does not exceed `max_flight_time`.
4.  The total travel time (including the return to the depot) for all delivery tasks is minimized.
5.  Each task is assigned to exactly one drone.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph of the city. The keys are node IDs (integers), and the values are dictionaries representing the outgoing edges from that node. Each outgoing edge is represented as `neighbor_node_id: travel_time_function`.
*   `delivery_tasks`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a delivery task: `(pickup_location, delivery_location, start_time, end_time)`.  `pickup_location` and `delivery_location` are node IDs (integers), and `start_time` and `end_time` are in seconds.
*   `depot_location`: The node ID (integer) representing the depot location.
*   `max_flight_time`: The maximum flight time (in seconds) a drone can fly before needing to recharge (integer).
*   `time_dependent_travel_times`: A function that takes the `graph`, `start_node`, `end_node`, and `departure_time` as input and returns the travel time (in seconds) between `start_node` and `end_node` at the given `departure_time`.  This function models the changing traffic conditions.

**Output:**

A list of routes, where each route is a list of node IDs representing the path the drone should take: `[depot_location, ..., pickup_location, ..., delivery_location, ..., depot_location]`.  If no feasible solution is found that satisfies all the constraints, return an empty list. The order of the routes in the output list should correspond to the order of the delivery tasks in the input list.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The graph can be large (thousands of nodes and edges).
*   Travel times are time-dependent, so the time of day significantly affects the feasibility of a route.
*   Finding the shortest path between two nodes in a time-dependent graph is more complex than standard shortest path algorithms.
*   Multiple valid solutions might exist; your goal is to minimize the total travel time for all deliveries.
*   The number of delivery tasks can also be relatively large, so the solution needs to be efficient.
*   The time window constraints must be strictly adhered to.
*   Assume that the drone can instantly pick up and drop off the package at the locations.
*   Assume that the graph is strongly connected, meaning that there's a path between any two nodes.

**Example:**

```python
# Simplified Graph (for demonstration purposes)
graph = {
    0: {1: lambda t: 10 + (t % 60) // 10},  # Depot (0) to Pickup (1)
    1: {2: lambda t: 20 + (t % 60) // 5},  # Pickup (1) to Delivery (2)
    2: {0: lambda t: 15 + (t % 60) // 15}   # Delivery (2) to Depot (0)
}

def time_dependent_travel_times(graph, start_node, end_node, departure_time):
  return graph[start_node][end_node](departure_time)

delivery_tasks = [(1, 2, 10, 60)] # Pickup at 1, deliver at 2, between time 10 and 60
depot_location = 0
max_flight_time = 60

routes = find_optimal_routes(graph, delivery_tasks, depot_location, max_flight_time, time_dependent_travel_times)

# Expected Output (a possible solution, may vary):
# [[0, 1, 2, 0]]
```

**Hint:**

*   Consider using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search to find the shortest path in the time-dependent graph. You will need to modify these algorithms to account for the time-varying travel times.  You'll want to use the `time_dependent_travel_times` function within your pathfinding algorithm.
*   Think about how to efficiently explore the search space of possible routes and task assignments.  Branch and bound, or other optimization techniques might be necessary.
*   Dynamic programming approaches could also be considered for calculating travel times.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful handling of time-dependent constraints. It is designed to be challenging and require efficient code to solve within reasonable time limits. Good luck!

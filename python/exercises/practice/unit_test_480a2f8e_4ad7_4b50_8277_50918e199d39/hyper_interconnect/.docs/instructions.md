Okay, here's a challenging coding problem suitable for a high-level programming competition, focusing on graph algorithms and optimization.

**Project Name:** `HyperInterconnect`

**Question Description:**

A groundbreaking new data center architecture, the *HyperInterconnect*, is being developed. This architecture relies on a unique network topology to achieve unprecedented data transfer speeds. The data center consists of `N` servers (numbered from `0` to `N-1`). Each server has a limited number of network interfaces, meaning it can only directly connect to a small subset of other servers.

The network topology is represented as a list of *hyperedges*. A hyperedge is a set of servers that can all communicate directly with each other. If server `A` and server `B` belong to the same hyperedge, they can instantly transmit data between them. Any server can belong to multiple hyperedges.

Your task is to design a system for efficiently routing data between any two servers in the HyperInterconnect data center. Given the network topology (a list of hyperedges) and a series of data transfer requests, determine the minimum number of *hyperedge traversals* required to route each request.

A hyperedge traversal is defined as moving data from one server to another *within the same hyperedge*. For example, if server 'A' needs to send data to server 'B', and they are in the same hyperedge, it takes one hyperedge traversal.

**Input:**

1.  `N`: An integer representing the number of servers in the data center (1 <= N <= 100,000).
2.  `hyperedges`: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a hyperedge. Each element in the inner list is an integer representing a server ID (0 <= server ID < N). The hyperedges are unordered and may contain duplicates.
3.  `requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a data transfer request. Each tuple contains two integers: the source server ID and the destination server ID.

**Output:**

A list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of hyperedge traversals required to fulfill the corresponding data transfer request. Return -1 if no path exists between the source and destination server for a given request.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Datasets:** The number of servers, hyperedges, and requests can be significant. Solutions must be efficient to avoid timeouts.
*   **Optimization:** The goal is to minimize the number of hyperedge traversals. Suboptimal solutions will not be accepted.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the source and destination servers are the same, or where no path exists between them.
*   **Duplicate Servers in Hyperedges:** The input hyperedges may contain duplicate server IDs. Your solution should handle this gracefully without affecting correctness.
*   **Hyperedge Size:** The number of servers in a single hyperedge can vary significantly.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially with large datasets. Avoid creating unnecessary copies of large data structures.
*   **Multiple Valid Paths:** If multiple paths with the same minimum number of hyperedge traversals exist, any of them is acceptable.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
hyperedges = [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]
requests = [(0, 4), (1, 3), (0, 0)]

Output: [2, 2, 0]

Explanation:

- Request (0, 4): The shortest path is 0 -> 2 (within hyperedge [0, 1, 2]) -> 4 (within hyperedge [2, 3, 4]). This requires 2 hyperedge traversals.
- Request (1, 3): The shortest path is 1 -> 2 (within hyperedge [0, 1, 2]) -> 3 (within hyperedge [2, 3, 4]). This requires 2 hyperedge traversals.
- Request (0, 0): The source and destination are the same, so 0 hyperedge traversals are needed.
```

This problem challenges participants to combine graph traversal algorithms (like Breadth-First Search or Dijkstra's) with careful data structure selection to optimize for both time and memory efficiency. The hyperedge structure adds a layer of complexity to the standard graph traversal problem, demanding a sophisticated approach. Good luck!

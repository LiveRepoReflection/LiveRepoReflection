Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to push the limits of experienced programmers.

### Problem Title: Optimal Multi-Commodity Flow Allocation in a Dynamic Network

### Problem Description:

Imagine you're designing the core routing algorithm for a global Content Delivery Network (CDN). The CDN needs to efficiently distribute content (e.g., video streams, software updates) from origin servers to end-users across a dynamic network. The network is represented as a directed graph, where nodes are data centers and edges are network links with associated bandwidth capacities.

The challenge is to optimally allocate the flow of multiple commodities (different types of content) through this network, considering that both the network topology (link capacities, availability of data centers) and the demand for each commodity change over time. The goal is to minimize a weighted sum of two costs:

1.  **Bandwidth Cost:** The cost associated with using bandwidth on each link. This cost is proportional to the amount of bandwidth used on the link and a link-specific cost factor.

2.  **Latency Cost:** The cost associated with the latency experienced by each commodity. This cost is proportional to the total flow of the commodity multiplied by the average latency experienced by that commodity. Assume that latency on a link is proportional to the link's length and inversely proportional to remaining bandwidth.

**Input:**

*   A time series of network snapshots. Each snapshot represents the network state at a particular time. Each snapshot contains the following information:

    *   A list of data centers (nodes) with unique IDs.
    *   A list of directed links (edges) with:
        *   Source data center ID
        *   Destination data center ID
        *   Bandwidth capacity (integer)
        *   Link length (integer)
        *   Cost per unit bandwidth (float)
    *   A list of commodities (content types) with:
        *   Commodity ID
        *   Origin data center ID
        *   Destination data center ID (end-user location)
        *   Demand (integer - units of bandwidth required)
        *   Latency weight (float)
*   A time horizon `T` (number of snapshots).

**Output:**

For each network snapshot in the time series, output the optimal flow allocation for each commodity on each link. Specifically, for each snapshot, output a list of flow allocations, where each allocation contains:

*   Commodity ID
*   Source data center ID
*   Destination data center ID
*   Flow (integer - the amount of bandwidth allocated for this commodity on this link)

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Capacity Constraints:** The total flow on any link cannot exceed its bandwidth capacity.
*   **Flow Conservation:** For each commodity at each data center (except the origin and destination), the inflow must equal the outflow.
*   **Dynamic Network:** The network topology, link capacities, and commodity demands can change significantly between snapshots.
*   **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the weighted sum of bandwidth cost and latency cost across all links and commodities for each snapshot.
*   **Time Complexity:** The algorithm must be efficient enough to process a large number of snapshots and commodities within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds per snapshot).
*   **Real-World Considerations:** The solution should be robust to common network issues, such as link failures and data center outages (represented by bandwidth capacity dropping to 0 or nodes disappearing from the network snapshot).
*   **Multiple Valid Approaches:** There are multiple valid approaches to solving this problem, including linear programming, network flow algorithms, and heuristic optimization techniques. The challenge is to find an approach that balances solution quality and computational efficiency.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a video streaming service launching a new movie. Initially, demand is high near the origin server, but as the movie gains popularity, demand spreads to other regions. Simultaneously, network links may experience congestion or failures, requiring the routing algorithm to adapt and reallocate flow to maintain optimal performance.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** The solution must satisfy all constraints (capacity, flow conservation) and produce valid flow allocations.
2.  **Optimality:** The solution should minimize the weighted sum of bandwidth cost and latency cost. Solutions will be compared against a hidden optimal solution. A scoring function will penalize solutions that deviate from the optimal cost.
3.  **Efficiency:** The solution must run within the time limit.
4.  **Robustness:** The solution should handle edge cases and network failures gracefully.

This problem requires a deep understanding of network flow algorithms, optimization techniques, and efficient coding practices. Good luck!

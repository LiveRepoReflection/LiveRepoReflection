Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging programming competition problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Optimal Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Split Deliveries

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the delivery routes for a logistics company operating in a large city. The company has multiple depots, each with a limited number of vehicles.  They need to deliver packages to a set of customers, each with specific delivery time windows and demand.

**Specifically:**

*   **Input:**
    *   A list of `N` depots, each with:
        *   Location (x, y coordinates).
        *   Number of available vehicles.
        *   Vehicle capacity (maximum weight/volume a vehicle can carry).
        *   Operating hours (start and end time).
    *   A list of `M` customers, each with:
        *   Location (x, y coordinates).
        *   Delivery demand (weight/volume of the package).
        *   Delivery time window (earliest and latest delivery time).
        *   Service Time (Time to unload packages at customer).
    *   A cost matrix representing the travel time between any two locations (depot or customer). Assume travel time is symmetric (travel time from A to B is the same as from B to A). The travel time incorporates traffic conditions throughout the day.
    *   Vehicle Speed (used to calculate travel time).
    *   Penalty cost per unit of demand delivered late (outside of the time window).
    *   Penalty cost for using a vehicle.

*   **Constraints:**
    *   Each customer's demand must be fully satisfied.
    *   A customer's demand can be split across multiple vehicles (Split Delivery is allowed).
    *   Each vehicle must start and end its route at the same depot.
    *   A vehicle cannot exceed its capacity.
    *   Each vehicle must operate within the depot's operating hours.
    *   Deliveries must be made within the customer's time window, or incur a penalty.
    *   The number of vehicles used from each depot cannot exceed the number of available vehicles at that depot.
    *   Vehicles can only visit customers and must return to the origin depot.

*   **Objective:**

    Minimize the total cost, which is the sum of:
    *   Total travel time of all vehicles.
    *   Total late delivery penalty cost (for deliveries outside time windows).
    *   Total vehicle usage penalty cost (one time cost for each vehicle used).

*   **Output:**

    A list of routes, where each route is a list of locations (depot and customer IDs) visited by a vehicle, in the order they are visited.  For each route, specify the depot the vehicle starts from, the total demand delivered by the vehicle, the total travel time of the vehicle's route, and the late delivery penalty incurred (if any). Also, specify the total cost.

**Scoring:**

Submissions will be scored based on the total cost achieved.  Lower costs are better.  The test cases will vary in size (number of depots and customers) and complexity (time window tightness, demand distribution, depot locations). Some test cases will be designed to favor solutions that effectively utilize split deliveries, while others will penalize excessive splitting.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The problem is NP-hard, so finding the absolute optimal solution is likely impossible within the time limit.  The goal is to find a near-optimal solution as quickly as possible.  Solutions will be judged based on their ability to find low-cost solutions across a variety of test cases. Heuristic or metaheuristic approaches are expected.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   Customers very far from any depot.
*   Very tight time windows.
*   Demands that are significantly larger than vehicle capacity, forcing split deliveries.
*   A large number of depots and customers, requiring efficient data structures and algorithms.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must satisfy all constraints.
*   **Optimality:** The solution should minimize the total cost.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should run within a reasonable time limit.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should perform well on larger test cases.

This problem combines several aspects of vehicle routing, making it a very challenging optimization problem suitable for a high-level programming competition. Good luck!

# Parallel Data Processing

This package implements a parallel data processing pipeline that processes a large dataset by performing filtering, mapping, and aggregation operations in parallel using multiple processes.

## Features

- Processes data in chunks using a configurable number of parallel processes
- Applies filtering, mapping and deduplication transformations
- Calculates aggregate statistics on the transformed data
- Handles streaming data that might not fit in memory at once
- Provides robust error handling for various edge cases

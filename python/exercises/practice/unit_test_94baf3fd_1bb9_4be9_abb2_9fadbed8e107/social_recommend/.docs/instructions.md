Okay, here's a hard-level coding problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated:

## Problem: Decentralized Social Network Recommendation Engine

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a recommendation engine for a decentralized social network. Unlike traditional centralized social networks, this network has no central database or server. User data and connections are stored across a peer-to-peer network.

**Network Structure:**

The social network is represented as a directed graph. Each user is a node in the graph. An edge from user `A` to user `B` indicates that user `A` is following user `B`. Due to the decentralized nature, you don't have access to the entire graph at once. Instead, you can query individual nodes (users) to get their followers and followees.

**Data Access:**

You are provided with a function `get_neighbors(user_id)` which returns a tuple `(followers, followees)`. `followers` is a set of user IDs that follow `user_id`, and `followees` is a set of user IDs that `user_id` follows. This function simulates querying a specific node in the decentralized network.  This function has a non-negligible cost (simulating network latency and processing overhead).  Minimize its use.

**The Recommendation Problem:**

Given a target user `user_id` and a desired number of recommendations `k`, your task is to recommend `k` users that `user_id` is *not* already following, but are likely to be of interest to them.

**Interest Metric:**

Define the "interest" of a user `B` to user `A` as follows:

1.  **Common Followees:** The number of users that both `A` and `B` follow.
2.  **Follower Overlap:** The number of followers `A` and `B` have in common, weighted by how influential those common followers are. The influence of a follower `F` is determined by the number of users `F` follows. Less followees indicates a more focused and likely important account.

The overall interest score of user `B` to user `A` is calculated as:

`Interest(A, B) = CommonFollowees(A, B) + sum(Influence(F) for F in CommonFollowers(A, B))`

Where:

*   `CommonFollowees(A, B)`:  `len(followees(A) intersect followees(B))`
*   `CommonFollowers(A, B)`:  `followers(A) intersect followers(B)`
*   `Influence(F)`: 1 / (1 + number of followees of F)

**Constraints:**

*   **Memory Limit:** You have limited memory. Avoid storing the entire social graph in memory.
*   **API Call Limit:** The `get_neighbors(user_id)` function is expensive. Minimize the number of calls to this function. You will be penalized for excessive API calls.
*   **Efficiency:**  The solution must be efficient in terms of time complexity. Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be designed to handle a large number of users (potentially millions).
*   **Recommendations Uniqueness:** The returned recommendations must not contain the target `user_id` or any user already in their followees.
*   **Return Sorted Recommendations:** The recommendations must be returned as a list of `user_id`s, sorted in descending order of their interest score.
*   **Handle edge cases:** Handle cases where the target user or potential recommendation users have very few or no connections. Also handle cases where `k` is larger than the number of possible recommendations. In these cases, return as many recommendations as possible.

**Input:**

*   `user_id`: The ID of the target user (integer).
*   `k`: The number of recommendations to return (integer).
*   `get_neighbors`: A function that takes a user ID and returns a tuple `(followers, followees)` (both sets).

**Output:**

*   A list of `k` user IDs (integers), sorted in descending order of their interest score.

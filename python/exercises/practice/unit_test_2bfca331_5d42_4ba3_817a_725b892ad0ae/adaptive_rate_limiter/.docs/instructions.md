Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging coding problem. Here it is:

## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Adaptive Throttling

### Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service in Python. This service is crucial for protecting a backend system from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.  The rate limiter must adhere to the following requirements:

*   **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter should function correctly even with multiple instances of the backend system running concurrently. Therefore, in-memory solutions that do not synchronize state across instances are not sufficient.
*   **Configurable Rate Limits:** The service must support configurable rate limits per client (identified by a unique client ID). These limits can be expressed as a maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
*   **Adaptive Throttling:**  Beyond simple rate limiting, the service must implement adaptive throttling.  It should dynamically adjust the rate limits for clients based on the overall health and capacity of the backend system. Specifically:

    *   The system should monitor the average response time of the backend.
    *   If the average response time exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 500ms), the rate limits for all clients should be reduced proportionally.
    *   If the average response time falls below another predefined threshold (e.g., 200ms), the rate limits can be gradually increased, but not beyond their configured maximums.
*   **Persistence:** The rate limiter must persist rate limit usage counts and configurations, to avoid losing data across system restarts or failures.
*   **Concurrency:** Your implementation needs to be thread-safe and designed to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
*   **Efficiency:** The rate limiter must provide low-latency responses to avoid introducing significant overhead to the backend system. Aim for minimal impact on request processing time.

### Input

The rate limiter service will receive requests containing:

*   `client_id`: A unique identifier for the client making the request (string).
*   `request_timestamp`: The time the request was made (Unix timestamp, integer).

The service must also be able to receive configuration updates, specifying:

*   `client_id`: The client to update.
*   `rate_limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed.
*   `time_window`: The time window for the rate limit (in seconds).

### Output

For each request, the rate limiter service should return:

*   `allowed`: A boolean value indicating whether the request is allowed (True) or rate limited (False).
*   `retry_after`: If `allowed` is False, this value indicates the number of seconds the client should wait before retrying the request.

### Constraints

*   **Scalability:** The design should be scalable to handle a large number of clients and a high volume of requests.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be resilient to failures. Consider how to minimize downtime and data loss.
*   **Persistence Choice:** You are free to choose an appropriate persistence mechanism (e.g., Redis, a relational database, etc.) based on your design and performance considerations. Justify your choice.
*   **Backend System Health:**  Assume you have a mechanism to monitor the average response time of the backend system. You do not need to implement the monitoring itself, but you must integrate the response time data into your adaptive throttling logic.
*   **No External Libraries:** You are not allowed to use external rate-limiting libraries.  You can use standard Python libraries for concurrency, data structures, and persistence, but the core rate limiting logic must be your own implementation.

### Example

Let's say a client with `client_id = "client1"` has a rate limit of 10 requests per minute. If "client1" sends 12 requests within a minute, the first 10 requests should return `allowed = True`, and the next two should return `allowed = False` with an appropriate `retry_after` value. Furthermore, if the backend's average response time exceeds the threshold, the rate limit for "client1" and all other clients should be dynamically reduced.

Good luck!

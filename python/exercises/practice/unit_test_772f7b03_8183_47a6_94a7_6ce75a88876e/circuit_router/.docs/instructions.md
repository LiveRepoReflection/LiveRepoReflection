## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient circuit router for a dense integrated circuit. The circuit is represented as a 2D grid. Your goal is to connect a given set of terminal pairs with the shortest possible wire length while adhering to specific constraints.

**Input:**

*   `grid_size`: An integer representing the size of the square grid (e.g., a `grid_size` of 100 means a 100x100 grid). The grid coordinates range from (0, 0) to (grid\_size - 1, grid\_size - 1).
*   `terminal_pairs`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a terminal pair `((x1, y1), (x2, y2))`. `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of the two terminals that need to be connected.
*   `obstacles`: A set of tuples, where each tuple `(x, y)` represents the coordinates of an obstacle on the grid. Wires cannot pass through obstacles.
*   `wire_width`: An integer representing the width of each wire. Wires occupy a square area centered on the path coordinates. For example, a `wire_width` of 1 means wires occupy a single grid cell along the path. A `wire_width` of 3 means a 3x3 square centered on the path. The path must not cross obstacles or other wires with the given wire_width.

**Output:**

A list of lists, where each inner list represents the path for one terminal pair. Each path should be a list of tuples, where each tuple `(x, y)` represents a point on the path.  If a path cannot be found for a given terminal pair, return an empty list `[]` for that pair.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Shortest Path:** You must find the shortest possible path (minimum number of grid cells) for each terminal pair.  Euclidean distance is not considered; only Manhattan distance (L1 distance, sum of absolute differences of coordinates) should be minimized.
2.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** Wires cannot pass through any obstacle.
3.  **Wire Spacing:** Wires must not overlap with each other, considering the given `wire_width`.  The "keep-out" zone around a wire segment is a square centered on the segment, with side length equal to the `wire_width`.
4.  **Grid Boundaries:** Wires must stay within the grid boundaries (0 to `grid_size` - 1 for both x and y coordinates).
5.  **Performance:** The solution must be efficient enough to handle large grids (e.g., `grid_size` = 500) and a significant number of terminal pairs (e.g., 100-200) within a reasonable time (e.g., under 60 seconds).  Consider algorithmic complexity and data structure choices carefully.
6.  **Scalability:** The solution must be scalable to handle future scenarios with more complex constraints (e.g., different wire widths for different layers, vias to connect wires on different layers).  While you don't need to implement these future constraints, your design should be extensible enough to accommodate them.
7.  **Memory Usage:** Minimize memory usage, especially for large grids.
8.  **Multiple Valid Paths:** If multiple shortest paths exist, any one of them is acceptable.
9.  **No Path Found:** If no path exists for a terminal pair due to obstacles or wire spacing constraints, return an empty list `[]` for that pair. It is acceptable if the code can return partial results if no paths can be found for some terminal pairs.

**Example:**

```python
grid_size = 10
terminal_pairs = [((1, 1), (8, 8)), ((2, 2), (5, 5))]
obstacles = {(3, 3), (4, 4), (6, 6), (7, 7)}
wire_width = 1

# Expected Output (Example - paths may vary):
# [
#   [(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)],
#   [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]
# ]
```

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does the solution correctly find paths that connect the terminal pairs without violating any constraints?
*   **Optimality:** Are the paths found close to the shortest possible length?
*   **Performance:** How quickly does the solution run for large grids and a significant number of terminal pairs?
*   **Scalability:** Is the design of the solution extensible to handle future constraints?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

Good luck! This is a challenging problem that requires careful consideration of algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

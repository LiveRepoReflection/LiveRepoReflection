Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level.

**Project Name:** Network Congestion Control

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with simulating a simplified network congestion control algorithm. The network consists of `n` nodes (numbered 0 to n-1) and `m` directed edges. Each edge has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of data that can flow through it per unit of time.

Data packets originate from a designated source node (node 0) and must be routed to a destination node (node n-1). The network is susceptible to congestion. To prevent congestion collapse, you need to implement a congestion control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sending rate of the source node based on network feedback.

Initially, the source node starts with a sending rate of 1 packet per unit of time.  At each time step, the following actions occur:

1.  **Packet Propagation:**  Packets are sent from the source node through the network to the destination. You need to determine the maximum flow from the source to the destination, respecting the capacity constraints of each edge. You can use any standard maximum flow algorithm (e.g., Edmonds-Karp, Dinic's). Assume that any packets that arrive at the destination node are immediately consumed.

2.  **Congestion Detection:** After the packets have been propagated, each edge reports its utilization rate. The utilization rate of an edge is the actual flow through the edge divided by its capacity. The network is considered congested if *any* edge has a utilization rate strictly greater than a congestion threshold `T` (0 < `T` < 1).

3.  **Rate Adjustment:**
    *   If the network is congested, the source node *multiplicatively decreases* its sending rate by a factor of `B` (0 < `B` < 1).
    *   If the network is *not* congested, the source node *additively increases* its sending rate by a constant `A` (A > 0).

However, the sending rate should never drop below a minimum rate `R_min` (R_min > 0) or exceed a maximum rate `R_max` (R_max > 0).

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (2 <= n <= 100).
*   `m`: The number of directed edges in the network (1 <= m <= 500).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, capacity)` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with the given `capacity` (0 <= u, v < n; 1 <= capacity <= 100).
*   `T`: The congestion threshold (0 < T < 1).
*   `A`: The additive increase factor (A > 0).
*   `B`: The multiplicative decrease factor (0 < B < 1).
*   `R_min`: The minimum sending rate (R_min > 0).
*   `R_max`: The maximum sending rate (R_max > 0).
*   `time_steps`: The number of time steps to simulate (1 <= time_steps <= 1000).

**Output:**

A list of floats, where the i-th element represents the sending rate of the source node at the i-th time step.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The graph may not be fully connected. If there's no path from the source to the destination, the maximum flow will be 0.
*   The graph can contain cycles.
*   The initial sending rate is 1.
*   Ensure that `R_min` <= 1 <= `R_max`.
*   The maximum flow algorithm should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit.
*   Be mindful of floating-point precision issues when comparing utilization rates with the threshold `T`.
*   The output sending rates should be rounded to 6 decimal places.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The maximum flow algorithm used should have a reasonable time complexity (e.g., O(V\*E^2) for Edmonds-Karp or better).
*   The overall simulation should be efficient enough to handle the specified number of time steps within the time limit.

This problem combines graph algorithms (maximum flow), simulation, and congestion control concepts. It tests your ability to implement efficient algorithms, handle floating-point numbers, and consider various edge cases. Good luck!

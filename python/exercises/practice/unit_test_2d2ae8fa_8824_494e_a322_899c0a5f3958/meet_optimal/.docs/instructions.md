Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Python coding problem. Here it is:

## Project Name

`OptimalMeetingScheduler`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building an efficient meeting scheduler for a large distributed organization.  The organization has a complex hierarchy, and employees have varying levels of importance.  The goal is to find the *optimal* meeting time that minimizes disruption across the organization while considering the attendance of key personnel.

**Input:**

You are given the following:

1.  **`employees`**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an employee. Each employee dictionary has the following keys:
    *   `id` (int): A unique identifier for the employee.
    *   `level` (int): The employee's level in the organization (higher number = higher importance).
    *   `availability` (list of tuples): A list of time slots representing when the employee is available for meetings. Each time slot is a tuple `(start_time, end_time)`, where `start_time` and `end_time` are integers representing the start and end time of the slot (in minutes from the start of the day, 0-1439).  Time slots are non-overlapping for a single employee but can be of arbitrary length.

2.  **`meeting_duration`**: An integer representing the desired duration of the meeting in minutes.

3.  **`required_attendees`**: A list of employee `id`s of employees who *must* attend the meeting.

4.  **`optional_attendees`**: A list of employee `id`s of employees who are optional to attend the meeting.

5.  **`working_hours`**: A tuple `(start_time, end_time)` defining the working hours in minutes from the start of the day. The meeting must occur entirely within these working hours.

**Output:**

Return a tuple `(start_time, end_time)` representing the optimal meeting time. If no suitable time slot exists, return `None`.

**Optimization Criteria:**

The "optimal" meeting time is determined by minimizing the *disruption score*. The disruption score is calculated as follows:

1.  **Inconvenience per employee:**
    *   If an employee *cannot* attend a proposed meeting time (i.e., it falls outside their availability), their inconvenience is equal to their `level`.
    *   If an employee *can* attend, their inconvenience is 0.

2.  **Total Disruption Score:** The sum of the inconveniences of *all* employees in the organization.

The optimal meeting time is the valid meeting time (within working hours and where all required attendees are available) that minimizes the total disruption score.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be efficient for a large number of employees (e.g., 10,000+).
*   The number of available time slots per employee can vary.
*   Employees can have the same `level`.
*   The `id`s in `required_attendees` and `optional_attendees` are guaranteed to be valid employee `id`s.
*   All `start_time` and `end_time` values are valid minutes within a day (0-1439).
*   `start_time` will always be less than `end_time` for each availability slot.
*   `meeting_duration` is a positive integer.

**Example:**

(Simplified for brevity - imagine many more employees)

```python
employees = [
    {'id': 1, 'level': 3, 'availability': [(600, 720)]},  # 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
    {'id': 2, 'level': 5, 'availability': [(660, 780)]},  # 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM
    {'id': 3, 'level': 2, 'availability': [(600, 660), (720, 780)]} # 10:00-11:00 and 12:00-1:00
]
meeting_duration = 60
required_attendees = [1, 2]
optional_attendees = [3]
working_hours = (540, 840) # 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM

# Expected Output: (660, 720)  # 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
# Both required attendees are available, and optional attendee 3 is also available (disruption = 0)
```

**Hints for tackling the problem:**

*   Consider how to efficiently check if an employee is available during a given time slot.  Naive iteration will be too slow.
*   Think about how to pre-process the employee data to speed up the disruption score calculation.
*   Focus on optimizing the search for valid meeting times.  Brute-force checking every possible time slot will likely time out for large inputs.
*   Consider using efficient data structures to represent availability schedules.
*   Consider using a priority queue (heap) to efficiently find the best meeting time.  You can use the disruption score as the priority.
*   Be mindful of integer overflow if level numbers are large.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques to achieve a solution that passes within reasonable time limits. Good luck!

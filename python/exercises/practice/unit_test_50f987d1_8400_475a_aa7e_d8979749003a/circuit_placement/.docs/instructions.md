OptimalCircuitPlacement

### Question Description

A cutting-edge hardware company is designing a new generation of microchips. These microchips contain a network of interconnected circuit components. Due to manufacturing limitations, these components cannot be placed arbitrarily close to each other. Your task is to write a program that determines the optimal placement of these components on the chip to minimize the total wire length, while adhering to minimum distance constraints.

**Specifics:**

*   **Components:** You are given *N* circuit components, each represented as a point in a 2D plane. Each component has a unique ID from 0 to N-1.
*   **Connections:** You are given a list of *M* connections between these components. Each connection is represented as a tuple (component1_id, component2_id, weight). The `weight` signifies the importance of a connection.
*   **Placement:** The placement of each component is defined by (x, y) coordinates. You need to determine the (x, y) coordinates for each component.
*   **Distance Constraints:** You are given a minimum distance *D*. No two components can be placed closer than this distance. Euclidean distance should be used for distance calculation.
*   **Objective:** Minimize the *weighted sum* of Manhattan distances between connected components. The Manhattan distance between two components (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. The weighted sum is calculated as:  sum(weight \* ManhattanDistance(component1, component2)) for each connection.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   1 <= N <= 20
    *   0 <= M <= N\*(N-1)/2
    *   1 <= D <= 10
    *   Component IDs are integers between 0 and N-1, inclusive.
    *   Weights are positive integers between 1 and 100.
    *   All initial component coordinates must be within a bounding box of 0 <= x <= 100 and 0 <= y <= 100.
    *   The optimal solution must respect the minimum distance D; if not, it will be considered invalid.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

1.  *N* (Number of components)
2.  *M* (Number of connections)
3.  A list of *M* tuples, where each tuple represents a connection: (component1\_id, component2\_id, weight)
4.  *D* (Minimum distance constraint)

**Output:**

Your program should output a list of *N* tuples, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a component. The list should be ordered by component ID (i.e., the first tuple is for component 0, the second for component 1, and so on). The coordinates should be rounded to two decimal places.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
4
3
(0, 1, 10)
(1, 2, 5)
(2, 3, 2)
5
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The outputted placement must satisfy the minimum distance constraint *D*.
*   **Optimization:** The solution will be judged based on how close the weighted sum of Manhattan distances is to the optimal (lowest possible) value. You are not required to find the absolute optimal solution, but better solutions will receive higher scores.
*   **Efficiency:** While the constraints are small, extremely inefficient solutions may time out. Aim for a solution that can handle the maximum input size within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 60 seconds).

**Potential Solution Approaches:**

*   Simulated Annealing
*   Genetic Algorithms
*   Gradient Descent (with careful handling of the distance constraints)
*   Constraint Programming with Optimization

This problem encourages the use of optimization techniques and careful consideration of constraints to achieve a good solution. The relatively small size of *N* allows for exploration of various approaches, but the optimization aspect is what makes it truly challenging. Good luck!

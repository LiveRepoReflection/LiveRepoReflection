Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization, and a touch of real-world relevance.

**Problem Title:**  Dynamic Skyline Reconstruction

**Problem Description:**

You are given a city represented by a series of buildings. Each building is a rectangle with a height, a left edge position, and a right edge position.  Formally, each building *i* is represented as a tuple `(left_i, right_i, height_i)`.

The *skyline* of the city is the outer contour formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance.  The skyline can be represented as a list of key points, where each key point is a tuple `(x, y)` representing the x-coordinate and the height at that point.  The skyline should be continuous, meaning consecutive key points should not have the same height.  The skyline starts at x=0 and ends at the largest building's right edge.

Now, the city is dynamic! Buildings can be added or removed at any time.

You are required to implement a `SkylineManager` class that supports the following operations:

*   `__init__()`: Initializes the skyline manager with an empty set of buildings.

*   `add_building(left, right, height)`: Adds a building to the city.  It is guaranteed that `left < right` and `height > 0`.

*   `remove_building(left, right, height)`: Removes a building from the city. It is guaranteed that a building with the exact `(left, right, height)` exists.

*   `get_skyline()`:  Returns the current skyline of the city as a list of key points `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]`. The skyline should be sorted by the x-coordinate.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Efficiency:** The `add_building`, `remove_building`, and `get_skyline` operations should be implemented as efficiently as possible. Naive solutions that recalculate the entire skyline from scratch for each operation will likely time out.  Consider using appropriate data structures to optimize performance.

2.  **Overlapping Buildings:** Buildings can overlap in any way.  A building can be entirely contained within another, partially overlap, or be completely separate.

3.  **Input Ranges:** The `left`, `right` and `height` values will be non-negative integers.  Assume that `0 <= left, right, height <= 10^9`. The number of calls to `add_building` and `remove_building` will be large (up to 10^5 calls each).

4.  **Output Format:** The output skyline should be in the specified format: a list of `(x, y)` tuples, sorted by x-coordinate, and with no consecutive key points having the same height.

5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases carefully, such as:
    *   Empty city (no buildings).
    *   Adding/removing a building that doesn't affect the skyline.
    *   Buildings with the same left or right coordinates.
    *   Buildings that completely obscure others.

6.  **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage. Storing all building data directly might lead to memory limits. Consider more efficient data structures for tracking height changes along the x-axis.

**Example:**

```python
# buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
# Skyline: [(2, 10), (3, 15), (7, 12), (12, 0), (15, 10), (20, 8), (24, 0)]

skyline_manager = SkylineManager()
skyline_manager.add_building(2, 9, 10)
skyline_manager.add_building(3, 7, 15)
skyline_manager.add_building(5, 12, 12)
skyline_manager.add_building(15, 20, 10)
skyline_manager.add_building(19, 24, 8)
print(skyline_manager.get_skyline()) # Expected output (order matters): [(2, 10), (3, 15), (7, 12), (12, 0), (15, 10), (20, 8), (24, 0)]

skyline_manager.remove_building(3, 7, 15)
print(skyline_manager.get_skyline()) # Expected output: [(2, 10), (3, 12), (9, 0), (15, 10), (20, 8), (24, 0)]
```

**Hints (to guide, not spoil):**

*   Consider using a data structure that can efficiently track the maximum height at any given x-coordinate. A heap (priority queue) or a sorted dictionary-like structure could be useful.
*   When removing a building, you need to update the height information for the affected x-coordinate range.
*   Think about how to efficiently merge overlapping building segments.
*   Avoid redundant calculations of the skyline.  Update only the necessary segments when buildings are added or removed.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and careful handling of edge cases to achieve an efficient and correct solution. Good luck!

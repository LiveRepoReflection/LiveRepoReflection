Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills.

**Problem Title: Distributed Consensus via Paxos Simulation**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with simulating a simplified version of the Paxos distributed consensus algorithm.  Your simulation will involve a cluster of `N` nodes (where `N` is an odd number to ensure a majority). These nodes will communicate over a network to agree on a single, immutable value.  The nodes can experience failures, including crashing and temporary network disruptions (message loss).

**System Design:**

Each node in the cluster can act as a *Proposer*, an *Acceptor*, and a *Learner*. While in a real Paxos implementation, these roles are often separated, in this simulation, each node will fulfill all three roles.

**Simplified Paxos Phases:**

Your simulation should implement the following simplified Paxos phases:

1.  **Prepare Phase:** A Proposer (node) initiates the consensus process by generating a unique proposal number (an integer) higher than any proposal number it has seen before. It then sends a "Prepare" message to all Acceptors (nodes).

2.  **Promise Phase:** An Acceptor, upon receiving a "Prepare" message, checks if the proposal number is higher than any proposal number it has previously promised to or accepted. If it is, the Acceptor *promises* not to accept any proposal with a lower number in the future. It sends a "Promise" message back to the Proposer. If the Acceptor has already accepted a proposal (number and value), it includes this accepted proposal in the "Promise" message. If the proposal number is not higher, the Acceptor simply ignores the "Prepare" message and sends nothing.

3.  **Accept Phase:** If the Proposer receives "Promise" messages from a majority of Acceptors (i.e., more than `N/2` nodes), it checks if any of the "Promise" messages contained an accepted proposal from a previous round. If so, the Proposer adopts the value from the highest numbered accepted proposal it received. Otherwise, the Proposer uses its own proposed value. The Proposer then sends an "Accept" message to all Acceptors, including the proposal number and the chosen value.

4.  **Accepted Phase:** An Acceptor, upon receiving an "Accept" message, checks if the proposal number is higher than any proposal number it has previously promised to or accepted. If it is, the Acceptor *accepts* the proposal (number and value) and stores it. It then sends an "Accepted" message to all Learners (nodes).  If the proposal number is not higher, the Acceptor ignores the "Accept" message and sends nothing.

5.  **Learn Phase:** Each Learner (node) monitors the "Accepted" messages it receives. Once a Learner receives "Accepted" messages from a majority of Acceptors for a specific value, it considers that value to be the consensus value.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Node Failures:** Nodes can fail (crash) at any point. Implement a mechanism for nodes to be temporarily "offline" (not responding to messages) and potentially "recover" (become responsive again).  A node crash should be simulated by ceasing to process any messages until it recovers.
*   **Message Loss:**  Simulate message loss due to network issues. Implement a probability (e.g., 10%) that a message sent between two nodes is lost and never delivered.
*   **Out-of-Order Delivery:** Messages between nodes may arrive out of order. Your implementation must handle this.
*   **Unique Proposal Numbers:** Ensure that each Proposer generates unique proposal numbers. A simple approach is to use the node's ID combined with a monotonically increasing counter.
*   **Efficiency:**  Minimize unnecessary message sending and processing.  Consider how to optimize the simulation to reach consensus quickly.  Don't let the same node keep proposing forever if it is unable to reach consensus, implement a backoff mechanism.
*   **Liveness:** Guarantee that the system will eventually reach a consensus, even with node failures and message loss, provided a majority of nodes remain operational for a sufficient period.
*   **Safety:** Ensure that the system never agrees on conflicting values.  Only one value can be agreed upon.
*   **Input:** The input to your program will be:
    *   `N`: The number of nodes in the cluster (an odd integer >= 3).
    *   `proposals`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a node ID (0 to N-1) and a proposed value.  For example, `[(0, "value1"), (1, "value2")]` means node 0 proposes "value1" and node 1 proposes "value2".
    *   `message_loss_probability`: The probability (between 0.0 and 1.0) that a message will be lost.
    *   `failure_rate`: The probability (between 0.0 and 1.0) that a node will fail at any given message processing step.
    *   `recovery_rate`: The probability (between 0.0 and 1.0) that a failed node will recover at any given message processing step.
    *   `max_steps`: The maximum number of simulation steps to run before giving up.

*   **Output:** Your program should output the single value that the cluster reaches consensus on. If the system does not reach consensus within `max_steps`, output "No Consensus".

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must correctly implement the Paxos algorithm, ensuring safety and liveness.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The simulation must handle node failures and message loss gracefully.
*   **Efficiency:** The simulation should reach consensus within a reasonable number of steps.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Handling of Edge Cases:**  The solution should address various edge cases, such as a single proposer, concurrent proposals, and prolonged node failures.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems, the Paxos algorithm, and careful consideration of various failure scenarios. Good luck!

## Problem: Optimized Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

You are tasked with implementing an optimized task scheduler for a system with strict deadlines. The system has `n` tasks, each with a unique ID from 0 to `n-1`. Each task `i` has the following attributes:

*   `deadline[i]`: The deadline for the task. The task must be completed by this time.
*   `duration[i]`: The time required to complete the task.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start.

Your scheduler must determine a schedule that allows all tasks to be completed before their deadlines, adhering to the dependencies. Due to limited resources, only **one task can be executed at any given time**.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of tasks.
*   `deadline`: A list of integers representing the deadlines for each task.
*   `duration`: A list of integers representing the duration for each task.
*   `dependencies`: A list of lists, where `dependencies[i]` contains the task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start.

**Output:**

*   A list of task IDs representing the order in which the tasks should be executed. If it is impossible to complete all tasks before their deadlines, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10000`
*   `1 <= deadline[i] <= 10^9`
*   `1 <= duration[i] <= 10^6`
*   Dependencies can form complex DAGs.
*   The solution must be optimized for speed. Naive solutions will likely time out.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient in terms of time complexity. Aim for a solution that is better than O(n^2) in the average case, considering the potential for a large number of tasks and dependencies.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Circular dependencies should be detected and result in an empty list being returned.
*   Tasks with no dependencies should be scheduled appropriately.
*   The problem should handle cases where multiple valid schedules exist, and return any one of them.
*   Handle cases where the sum of all durations exceeds the minimum deadline.

**Optimization Goals:**

*   Prioritize tasks with earlier deadlines to maximize the chances of meeting all deadlines.
*   Consider the critical path (longest path) through the dependency graph to identify tasks that are most likely to cause delays.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (for dependency resolution and cycle detection) and scheduling heuristics (for deadline prioritization and critical path analysis). An efficient implementation is crucial to handle the large input size and complex dependency relationships.

Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Python coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:**  Optimal Multi-Commodity Flow Network Design

**Problem Description:**

You are given a directed graph representing a communication network. Each node in the graph represents a router, and each edge represents a communication link. Each link has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of data that can flow through it.

You are also given a set of *k* commodities.  Each commodity *i* is defined by a source node *s<sub>i</sub>*, a destination node *t<sub>i</sub>*, and a demand *d<sub>i</sub>*. The demand represents the amount of data that must be routed from *s<sub>i</sub>* to *t<sub>i</sub>*.

Your task is to design the network to satisfy all commodity demands while minimizing the total cost. The cost is associated with upgrading the capacity of certain edges.  Each edge *e* has an initial capacity *c<sub>e</sub>*. You can increase the capacity of edge *e* by any non-negative integer amount, but each unit increase in capacity costs *cost<sub>e</sub>*.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Flow Conservation:** For each node (except source and destination nodes for a commodity), the total flow entering the node must equal the total flow leaving the node.

2.  **Capacity Constraints:** The flow on each edge must not exceed the edge's capacity. The capacity of an edge can be increased as described above.

3.  **Demand Satisfaction:** For each commodity *i*, the total flow from *s<sub>i</sub>* to *t<sub>i</sub>* must be equal to its demand *d<sub>i</sub>*.

4.  **Integer Capacities and Flows:** All initial capacities, capacity upgrades, flows, and demands must be non-negative integers.

5.  **Graph Structure:** The graph is guaranteed to be connected.

6.  **Input Size:**
    *   Number of nodes (routers): Up to 100
    *   Number of edges (communication links): Up to 500
    *   Number of commodities: Up to 20
    *   Demands: Up to 100
    *   Capacities: Up to 100
    *   Costs: Up to 100

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   Line 1: *n* (number of nodes), *m* (number of edges), *k* (number of commodities)
*   Next *m* lines:  *u* *v* *c* *cost* (representing a directed edge from node *u* to node *v* with initial capacity *c* and cost per unit capacity increase *cost*)  Nodes are numbered from 0 to *n*-1.
*   Next *k* lines: *s* *t* *d* (representing a commodity with source node *s*, destination node *t*, and demand *d*)

**Output Format:**

Output a single integer: the minimum total cost required to satisfy all commodity demands. If it is impossible to satisfy all demands, output -1.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
4 5 2
0 1 10 1
0 2 5 2
1 3 8 1
2 3 7 2
1 2 3 1
0 3 5
2 3 4
```

**Explanation of Example:**

*   4 nodes, 5 edges, 2 commodities.
*   Edge 0->1 has capacity 10, cost 1. Edge 0->2 has capacity 5, cost 2, etc.
*   Commodity 1: source 0, destination 3, demand 5.
*   Commodity 2: source 2, destination 3, demand 4.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on its correctness and efficiency.  Solutions must correctly handle all valid input cases within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds). Partial credit may be awarded for solutions that solve some, but not all, test cases. Optimality is critical: the lowest cost solution is expected.

**Challenge Elements:**

*   Requires understanding of network flow concepts, specifically multi-commodity flow.
*   Requires the use of optimization techniques.  A simple greedy approach will likely fail.
*   Potentially requires the use of linear programming or integer programming solvers for optimal solutions. Dynamic programming may be applicable with careful state definition but carries potential complexities.
*   Edge cases need to be carefully considered (e.g., disconnected graph, impossible demands, zero capacities).
*   Efficient implementation is crucial due to the size of the input constraints.

This problem is designed to be challenging and requires a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

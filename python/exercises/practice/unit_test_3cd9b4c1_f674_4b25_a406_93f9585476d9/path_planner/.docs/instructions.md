## Project Name

`OptimalPathPlanning`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal path-planning system for a fleet of autonomous delivery drones in a densely populated urban environment. The city is represented as a directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent intersections or landing zones, each with a unique integer ID.
*   Edges represent drone flight paths between locations, with associated costs.

Each edge has the following attributes:

*   `source`: The ID of the starting node.
*   `destination`: The ID of the ending node.
*   `distance`: The distance (in meters) of the flight path.
*   `energy_cost`: The energy consumed (in joules) to traverse the flight path.
*   `time_cost`: The time taken (in seconds) to traverse the flight path.
*   `weather_impact`: A factor (between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) representing the impact of current weather conditions on the edge's travel time. A value of 1.0 indicates no impact, while a value less than 1.0 indicates that the travel time is reduced due to favorable weather conditions (e.g., strong tailwinds), 0.5 mean the travel time is halved.

Your system must efficiently handle multiple delivery requests concurrently. Each delivery request specifies:

*   `start_node`: The ID of the starting node.
*   `end_node`: The ID of the destination node.
*   `deadline`: The latest acceptable arrival time (in seconds) from the moment the path is planned.
*   `priority`: An integer representing the priority of the delivery (higher value means higher priority).

The drones have limited battery capacity, which directly translates to a maximum energy budget for each delivery. Your system must find the *optimal* path for each delivery request, considering multiple constraints and optimization goals.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Energy Budget:** The total `energy_cost` of the chosen path must not exceed the drone's maximum energy budget. This budget is a fixed constant for all drones.
2.  **Deadline:** The total `time_cost` of the chosen path, adjusted by the `weather_impact` factor for each edge, must not exceed the delivery's `deadline`.
3.  **Optimal Path:** Among all paths that satisfy the above constraints, the system should choose the path that minimizes a weighted sum of `distance`, `energy_cost`, and `time_cost`. The weights for these factors are provided as constants.
4.  **Real-time Updates:** The system must be able to handle real-time updates to the graph, such as temporary road closures (edge removal) or changes in weather conditions (updates to `weather_impact`).

**Requirements:**

1.  Implement a function `find_optimal_path(graph, start_node, end_node, deadline, priority, energy_budget, distance_weight, energy_weight, time_weight)` that returns a list of node IDs representing the optimal path. If no path satisfying the constraints exists, return an empty list.
2.  The solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of delivery requests (e.g., thousands) with reasonable response times (e.g., sub-second).
3.  The system must be robust and handle various edge cases, such as disconnected graphs, invalid node IDs, or infeasible delivery requests.
4.  Implement functions `update_edge(graph, source, destination, new_distance, new_energy_cost, new_time_cost, new_weather_impact)` and `remove_edge(graph, source, destination)` to handle real-time updates to the graph. These operations should be efficient.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph. The keys are node IDs, and the values are lists of dictionaries representing outgoing edges from that node.
*   `start_node`: The ID of the starting node (integer).
*   `end_node`: The ID of the destination node (integer).
*   `deadline`: The delivery deadline (float, in seconds).
*   `priority`: The priority of the delivery (integer).
*   `energy_budget`: The drone's maximum energy budget (float, in joules).
*   `distance_weight`: The weight for the distance factor in the optimization (float).
*   `energy_weight`: The weight for the energy cost factor in the optimization (float).
*   `time_weight`: The weight for the time cost factor in the optimization (float).

**Output:**

*   A list of integers representing the optimal path (list of node IDs). If no path is found, return an empty list.

**Considerations:**

*   The graph can be very large (thousands of nodes and edges).
*   The edge weights (distance, energy cost, time cost) can vary significantly.
*   The weather impact factor can change frequently, affecting travel times.
*   Different pathfinding algorithms have different trade-offs in terms of performance and optimality.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and efficient data structures to achieve a robust and performant solution.  Consider how to balance the need for accurate path planning with the constraints of limited resources and real-time updates.

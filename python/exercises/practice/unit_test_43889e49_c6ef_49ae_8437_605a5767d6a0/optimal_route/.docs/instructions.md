## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal route planning system for a fleet of delivery drones in a city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are locations and edges are roads. Each road has a traffic condition that varies throughout the day, affecting the drone's travel time.

Given:

*   **A directed graph:** Representing the city's road network. Each node has an ID, and each edge has a source node ID, a destination node ID, a distance, and a set of time-dependent traffic conditions.
*   **Traffic conditions:** Each road has a set of time intervals (e.g., 8:00-9:00 AM, 9:00-10:00 AM) associated with specific speed multipliers. For example, a speed multiplier of 0.5 during a certain time interval means the drone's speed on that road is halved, effectively doubling the travel time. Assume time intervals are non-overlapping for a given road.
*   **A fleet of drones:** Each drone starts at a specific location (node) and has a delivery schedule consisting of multiple destinations (nodes) that must be visited in a given order.
*   **Time windows:** Each destination has a time window (start and end time) within which the drone *must* arrive to successfully complete the delivery. Arriving before the start time results in waiting time at the destination, while arriving after the end time results in a delivery failure.
*   **Drone speed:** Assume each drone has a constant base speed in distance units per time unit (e.g., kilometers per hour).
*   **Turnaround time:** Each delivery location has an associated turnaround time, the time it takes for the drone to unload and prepare for the next delivery.

Your goal is to write a function that takes the city graph, traffic conditions, drone fleet information, and delivery schedules as input and returns the optimal route for each drone. The optimal route minimizes the total travel time (including waiting time and turnaround time) while ensuring all deliveries are completed within their specified time windows.

Constraints:

*   The number of nodes and edges in the graph can be large (up to 10,000 nodes and 100,000 edges).
*   The number of drones can be up to 100.
*   Each drone's delivery schedule can have up to 20 destinations.
*   Time windows can be narrow, requiring precise route planning.
*   The solution should be efficient and scalable. Inefficient implementations may time out on larger test cases.

Specific Requirements:

1.  **Graph Representation:** You must efficiently represent the directed graph and the time-dependent traffic conditions.
2.  **Route Calculation:** You must implement an algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph, taking into account the time-dependent traffic conditions. A time-dependent variation of Dijkstra's or A\* algorithm is recommended.
3.  **Time Window Handling:** You must ensure that the drone arrives at each destination within its specified time window.
4.  **Optimization:** You must optimize the total travel time for each drone's route, considering travel time, waiting time, and turnaround time.
5.  **Scalability:** Your solution must be able to handle large graphs and complex delivery schedules within a reasonable time limit.

The function should return a dictionary where the key is the drone ID and the value is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a stop in the drone's optimal route and consists of the destination node ID and the arrival time at that node. If a drone cannot complete its delivery schedule within the time windows, return an empty list for that drone.

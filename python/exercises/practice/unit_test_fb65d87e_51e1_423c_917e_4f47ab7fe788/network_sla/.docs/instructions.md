Okay, here's a challenging coding problem suitable for a high-level programming competition, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world considerations.

## Question: Network Flow Optimization with Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

### Question Description

You are designing a network infrastructure for a cloud service provider. The network consists of interconnected nodes, each representing a server or a router. Your task is to efficiently manage data flow across this network while adhering to strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with your customers.

The network is represented as a directed graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent servers/routers. Each node has a processing capacity (maximum amount of data it can process per unit time).
*   **Edges:** Represent network links. Each edge has a bandwidth capacity (maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per unit time) and a latency (time taken to transmit data across the link).

You are given a set of data transfer requests. Each request specifies:

*   **Source Node:** The node where the data originates.
*   **Destination Node:** The node where the data needs to be delivered.
*   **Data Volume:** The amount of data to be transferred.
*   **Latency Requirement:** A maximum acceptable latency for the data transfer (part of the SLA).

Your objective is to determine the maximum number of requests that can be simultaneously satisfied while meeting all latency requirements. A request is considered satisfied if all its data volume is successfully transferred from the source to the destination, and the total latency experienced by the data does not exceed the request's latency requirement.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Node Capacity:** The total data processed by a node (sum of incoming and outgoing data) must not exceed its processing capacity.
2.  **Edge Capacity:** The data flowing through an edge must not exceed its bandwidth capacity.
3.  **Latency:** The total latency for each satisfied request must be less than or equal to its latency requirement. The latency of a path is the sum of the latencies of the edges in the path.
4.  **Optimization:** Maximize the number of satisfied requests. If multiple solutions achieve the same maximum number of satisfied requests, minimize the total data volume *not* transferred.
5.  **Real-world:** Data can be split across multiple paths to satisfy a single request, but the latency constraint must hold for each path used to send data.
6.  **Scale:** Number of nodes and requests can be large (thousands). Efficiency of your algorithm is critical.
7.  **Assumptions**: The data is infinitely divisible.

**Input:**

*   A directed graph represented as an adjacency list or similar structure. Each node has a `capacity` attribute and each edge has `capacity` and `latency` attributes.
*   A list of data transfer requests, each with `source`, `destination`, `data_volume`, and `latency_requirement` attributes.

**Output:**

*   The maximum number of requests that can be simultaneously satisfied.
*   For each satisfied request, the amount of data transferred.
*   A mapping of each edge to the amount of flow passing through it.

**Example:**

Imagine a small network with 3 nodes (A, B, C) and 2 edges (A->B, B->C).  Each edge has a limited capacity and latency. You have two requests: one from A to C, and another from B to C. The challenge is to determine if you can satisfy both requests, or if you need to prioritize one based on capacity and latency constraints.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution correctly identify which requests can be satisfied?
*   Optimization: How close is the solution to the optimal number of satisfied requests?
*   Efficiency: How well does the solution scale with the size of the network and the number of requests?
*   Code Clarity: Is the code well-structured and easy to understand?

This problem combines graph algorithms (network flow, shortest paths), optimization techniques (potentially linear programming or heuristics), and real-world constraints, making it a highly challenging and sophisticated coding task. Good luck!

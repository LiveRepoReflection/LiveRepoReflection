Okay, here's a problem designed to be quite challenging:

## Project Name

`AutonomousVehicleRouting`

## Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing the routing of autonomous vehicles (AVs) within a large-scale smart city. The city is represented as a weighted directed graph, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments. Each road segment has a *dynamic* congestion score that changes over time.

Specifically, the city has `N` intersections (numbered 0 to N-1) and `M` directed road segments. Each road segment `(u, v)` has an associated base travel time `base_time(u, v)`.

However, the actual travel time along a road segment is affected by real-time congestion. You are given a function `congestion(u, v, t)` that returns a congestion factor for the road segment `(u, v)` at time `t`. The actual travel time is calculated as `travel_time(u, v, t) = base_time(u, v) * congestion(u, v, t)`.

Your system needs to efficiently handle the following types of requests:

1.  **Single AV Route Planning:** Given a start intersection `start`, a destination intersection `end`, a departure time `departure_time`, and a planning horizon `horizon`, find the *fastest* route for a single AV to travel from `start` to `end`.  The planning horizon limits how far into the future the route planner can consider potential congestion changes. You must return the sequence of intersections in the fastest route, and the estimated arrival time.

2.  **Fleet Rebalancing:** Given a list of `K` AVs, each with its current location (intersection) and a desired destination intersection, find the *minimum total travel time* required to rebalance the fleet. You can assume that the AVs can be assigned to destinations in any order. You need to return the total travel time for the optimal assignment and the assignment mapping for each AV.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be very large (up to 10,000 intersections and 50,000 road segments).
*   The `congestion(u, v, t)` function is computationally expensive to evaluate, so minimize its calls. The congestion factor is guaranteed to be >= 1.
*   The `base_time(u, v)` is a constant integer.
*   The planning horizon `horizon` for single AV route planning is a positive integer.
*   The number of AVs `K` for fleet rebalancing can be up to 100.
*   All times are represented as integers.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of requests within a reasonable time (e.g., under 1 second per request on average).
*   Minimize the number of calls to the `congestion(u, v, t)` function, as it is the most computationally expensive operation.
*   Consider trade-offs between solution accuracy and computation time. Heuristic approaches might be necessary for fleet rebalancing.

**Specific Input/Output:**

*   **Graph Representation:** You can choose your preferred graph representation. Make sure to clearly document it.
*   **`congestion(u, v, t)` Function:** This function is provided to you. Do not implement it yourself. You should treat this as a black box.
*   **Single AV Route Planning Input:** `start: int`, `end: int`, `departure_time: int`, `horizon: int`
*   **Single AV Route Planning Output:** `(path: List[int], arrival_time: int)` where `path` is a list of intersection IDs representing the route, and `arrival_time` is the estimated arrival time at the destination. If no path exists, return `(None, None)`.
*   **Fleet Rebalancing Input:** `avs: List[Tuple[int, int]]` where each tuple represents an AV with its current location and desired destination (e.g., `[(start_1, end_1), (start_2, end_2), ...]`).
*   **Fleet Rebalancing Output:** `(total_travel_time: int, assignment: Dict[int, int])` where `total_travel_time` is the minimum total travel time for the optimal assignment, and `assignment` is a dictionary mapping AV index to its assigned destination index (e.g., `{0: 1, 1: 0}` means AV 0 is assigned to the destination of AV 1, and vice versa).

This problem challenges you to combine graph algorithms (shortest path), dynamic programming or optimization techniques (for fleet rebalancing), and efficient data structures to solve a realistic problem with significant performance constraints. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem description, aiming for a difficulty level comparable to LeetCode Hard.

## Problem:  Dynamic Resource Allocation with Deadline Constraints

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a resource allocation system for a distributed computing environment.  There are a set of `N` independent tasks that need to be executed.  Each task `i` requires a specific amount of resource `r_i` (CPU cores, memory, etc. - represented as a single integer value) and has a deadline `d_i` (a timestamp).

The computing environment consists of `M` machines.  Each machine `j` has a total resource capacity `c_j`.  A task can only be executed on one machine at a time, and a machine can only execute tasks up to its resource capacity at any given point in time.  Once a task is assigned to a machine, it occupies the resources for its entire duration. Assume each task requires one unit of time to complete.

The goal is to maximize the number of tasks that are completed before their deadlines.  You need to design an algorithm that determines which tasks to execute on which machines, and at what time, to achieve this maximum.

**Input:**

*   `N`:  The number of tasks (1 <= N <= 1000)
*   `M`:  The number of machines (1 <= M <= 100)
*   `tasks`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(r_i, d_i)` represents a task. `r_i` is the resource requirement of task `i` (1 <= `r_i` <= 100), and `d_i` is the deadline of task `i` (1 <= `d_i` <= 1000).
*   `machines`: A list of integers, where each integer `c_j` represents the resource capacity of machine `j` (1 <= `c_j` <= 500).

**Output:**

An integer representing the maximum number of tasks that can be completed before their deadlines.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Optimization:** The primary goal is to maximize the number of completed tasks before their deadlines.  Your algorithm must be efficient enough to handle the given input sizes.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   **Time Complexity:**  Aim for a solution with a reasonable time complexity.  Solutions with O(N! * M) or similar exponential complexities will not be feasible.  Consider dynamic programming, greedy algorithms with clever optimizations, or network flow approaches.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Tasks with very large resource requirements that cannot fit on any machine.
    *   Tasks with very early deadlines.
    *   A large number of tasks compared to the number of machines.
    *   Machines with very low capacity.
*   **Real-world Relevance:**  This problem models resource allocation in cloud computing, job scheduling in data centers, and similar scenarios.
*   **Multiple Valid Approaches:** There might be multiple valid approaches to solve this problem with varying trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and implementation complexity.  Consider these trade-offs when designing your solution.
*   **Resource contention:** Tasks assigned to the same machine cannot overlap in time, and the total resource required by tasks executing on a machine at any given time cannot exceed the machine's capacity.
*   **Non-preemptive:** Once a task is started on a machine, it must run to completion (i.e., tasks cannot be paused or migrated to another machine).

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

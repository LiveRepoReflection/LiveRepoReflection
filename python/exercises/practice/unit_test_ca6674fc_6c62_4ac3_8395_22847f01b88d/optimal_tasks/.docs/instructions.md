## Problem: Optimal Task Assignment with Dependencies and Deadlines

**Description:**

You are managing a project with a set of `N` tasks. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `cost[i]`: The cost of completing the task.
*   `deadline[i]`: The deadline by which the task must be completed. The project starts at time 0.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task indices that must be completed before task `i` can be started. Note that if dependencies[i] is an empty list `[]`, it means task `i` has no dependencies.

Your goal is to determine the *minimum total cost* to complete a subset of the tasks such that the following conditions are met:

1.  **Dependency Satisfaction:** If a task is included in the selected subset, all of its dependencies must also be included in the subset.
2.  **Deadline Adherence:** Every task included in the selected subset must be completed by its deadline. You can only work on one task at a time. The time to complete task `i` is equivalent to its `cost[i]`. Tasks can be completed in any order as long as dependencies are satisfied.

If it is impossible to find a valid subset that satisfies both conditions, return `-1`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks. `1 <= N <= 20`
*   `cost`: A list of integers representing the cost of each task. `1 <= cost[i] <= 10^9`
*   `deadline`: A list of integers representing the deadline of each task. `1 <= deadline[i] <= 10^9`
*   `dependencies`: A list of lists of integers representing the dependencies of each task.

**Output:**

*   The minimum total cost to complete a valid subset of tasks. Return `-1` if no such subset exists.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 20`
*   `1 <= cost[i] <= 10^9`
*   `1 <= deadline[i] <= 10^9`
*   `0 <= len(dependencies[i]) < N`
*   Task indices are 0-based.
*   The dependency graph may contain cycles. If it does, no solution is possible.
*   Due to the potential for large cost values, consider using appropriate data types to avoid overflow.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient. A brute-force approach will likely time out.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
cost = [5, 3, 8, 4]
deadline = [10, 12, 15, 20]
dependencies = [[], [0], [0, 1], [2]]

Output: 20

Explanation: The optimal subset is to include all tasks (0, 1, 2, 3).
- Task 0: Cost 5, Deadline 10
- Task 1: Cost 3, Deadline 12, Dependency: 0
- Task 2: Cost 8, Deadline 15, Dependencies: 0, 1
- Task 3: Cost 4, Deadline 20, Dependency: 2

One possible schedule:
1. Task 0 (Cost 5, Completion Time 5 <= Deadline 10)
2. Task 1 (Cost 3, Completion Time 8 <= Deadline 12)
3. Task 2 (Cost 8, Completion Time 16 <= Deadline 15) - Violates Deadline!

Another possible schedule:
1. Task 0 (Cost 5, Completion Time 5 <= Deadline 10)
2. Task 1 (Cost 3, Completion Time 8 <= Deadline 12)
3. Task 3 (Cost 4, Completion Time 12 <= Deadline 20)
4. Task 2 (Cost 8, Completion Time 20 <= Deadline 15) - Violates Deadline!

Optimal Schedule:
1. Task 0 (Cost 5, Completion Time 5 <= Deadline 10)
2. Task 1 (Cost 3, Completion Time 8 <= Deadline 12)
3. Task 2 (Cost 8, Completion Time 16 <= Deadline 15) - Deadline Violated, so cannot select task 2
4. Task 3 (Cost 4, Completion Time 12 <= Deadline 20)

Consider subset {0, 1, 3}:
1. Task 0 (Cost 5, Completion Time 5 <= Deadline 10)
2. Task 1 (Cost 3, Completion Time 8 <= Deadline 12)
3. Task 3 (Cost 4, Completion Time 12 <= Deadline 20)

Total cost = 5 + 3 + 4 = 12.  This is a valid subset with cost 12.

Now consider subset {0, 1}:
1. Task 0 (Cost 5, Completion Time 5 <= Deadline 10)
2. Task 1 (Cost 3, Completion Time 8 <= Deadline 12)

Total cost = 5 + 3 = 8

Now consider subset {0}:
1. Task 0 (Cost 5, Completion Time 5 <= Deadline 10)

Total cost = 5

The subset {0, 1, 3} is not optimal. Neither is {0}. {0,1} is optimal with the cost 8. But if instead of {0,1}, the optimal cost is 12 for the set {0,1,3}

```

This problem requires a combination of bit manipulation (for representing subsets), topological sorting (to detect cycles and order tasks), and dynamic programming (or a similar optimization technique) to efficiently explore the possible task subsets and find the minimum cost.  The deadline constraint adds significant complexity.

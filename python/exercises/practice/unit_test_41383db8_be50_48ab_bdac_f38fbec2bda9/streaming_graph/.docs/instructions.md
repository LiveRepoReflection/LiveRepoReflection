### Question Description

You are building a real-time graph analytics system. Data arrives as a continuous stream of edge additions and removals to a large graph.  The graph's nodes represent users, and edges represent connections between them.  Your task is to maintain and efficiently query the size of the largest connected component in the graph at any given point in time, while minimizing processing latency.

Specifically, you will receive a series of operations. Each operation is one of the following:

*   **`add u v`**:  Add an undirected edge between user `u` and user `v`. If an edge already exists between `u` and `v`, ignore the command.
*   **`remove u v`**: Remove the undirected edge between user `u` and user `v`. If no edge exists between `u` and `v`, ignore the command.
*   **`query`**: Return the size (number of nodes) of the largest connected component in the graph.

Nodes are represented by non-negative integers. Initially, the graph is empty (no nodes or edges).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of operations will be up to 10<sup>6</sup>.
*   Node IDs (u, v) will be integers between 0 and 10<sup>5</sup> (inclusive).
*   Multiple `add u v` operations may refer to the same `u` and `v`.
*   Multiple `remove u v` operations may refer to the same `u` and `v`.
*   The graph is undirected (adding `u v` is the same as adding `v u`).
*   The solution must process each operation in sublinear time on average to pass the test. Aim for close to O(1) for `add` and `remove` and O(sqrt(n)) for `query`, where n is the number of nodes. (Achieving true O(1) is likely impossible given the dynamic nature of the graph and the need to find connected components).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the time complexity of each operation, especially `add` and `remove`.  The `query` operation is called less frequently, but should still be optimized.
*   Minimize memory usage.  Storing the entire graph explicitly as an adjacency matrix will likely exceed memory limits.
*   Consider the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms.
*   Your solution should be able to handle a large number of edge additions and removals efficiently.

**Input:**

A list of strings, where each string represents an operation.

**Output:**

A list of integers, where each integer is the result of a `query` operation. The order of the integers in the output list must correspond to the order of the `query` operations in the input list.

**Example:**

```
Input:
["add 0 1", "add 1 2", "query", "remove 1 2", "query", "add 2 3", "add 3 4", "add 4 5", "query"]

Output:
[3, 2, 4]
```
Explanation:

1. `add 0 1`: Adds an edge between nodes 0 and 1.
2. `add 1 2`: Adds an edge between nodes 1 and 2.
3. `query`: The largest connected component is {0, 1, 2}, with size 3.
4. `remove 1 2`: Removes the edge between nodes 1 and 2.
5. `query`: The largest connected components are {0, 1} and {2}, so the largest is {0, 1} with size 2.
6. `add 2 3`: Adds an edge between nodes 2 and 3.
7. `add 3 4`: Adds an edge between nodes 3 and 4.
8. `add 4 5`: Adds an edge between nodes 4 and 5.
9. `query`: The largest connected component is {2, 3, 4, 5}, with size 4.
```

This question emphasizes efficient data structure selection and algorithmic design to meet stringent performance constraints. The sheer scale of the operations, coupled with the real-time query requirement, makes it a formidable challenge. Good luck!

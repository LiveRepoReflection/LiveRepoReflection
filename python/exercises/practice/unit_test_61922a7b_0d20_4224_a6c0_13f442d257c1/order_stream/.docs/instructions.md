## Problem: Scalable Real-Time Order Book Reconstruction

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a system that reconstructs a real-time order book from a stream of market data events. An order book is a list of buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders organized by price level. Your system must efficiently handle a massive volume of incoming order events and maintain an accurate, up-to-date representation of the order book.

**Input:**

Your system will receive a continuous stream of order events. Each event is represented as a tuple with the following structure:

`(timestamp, order_id, side, price, quantity, event_type)`

Where:

*   `timestamp` (int): The time the event occurred, represented as milliseconds since epoch.
*   `order_id` (string): A unique identifier for the order.
*   `side` (string): Either "buy" (bid) or "sell" (ask).
*   `price` (float): The price of the order.
*   `quantity` (int): The quantity of shares in the order.
*   `event_type` (string): The type of event:
    *   "new": A new order is placed on the book.
    *   "cancel": An existing order is canceled (quantity becomes 0).
    *   "execute": An existing order is partially or fully executed. The quantity in the event is the amount executed, which must be subtracted from the existing orderâ€™s quantity.

The input stream is not guaranteed to be perfectly ordered by timestamp. There may be some out-of-order events, but the out-of-order window is guaranteed to be relatively small (e.g., no more than 100 milliseconds). The stream can be very large (GBs per hour).

**Output:**

Your system should provide a function `get_order_book(side, depth)` that returns a list representing the top `depth` levels of the order book for the specified `side`.

*   `side` (string): Either "buy" or "sell".
*   `depth` (int): The number of price levels to return.

The returned list should be sorted by price (descending for "buy", ascending for "sell"). Each element in the list should be a tuple: `(price, quantity)`.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** Your system must handle a high volume of incoming order events (e.g., 100,000+ events per second).
*   **Accuracy:** The order book must accurately reflect the current state based on all processed events.  Events must be processed in chronological order based on timestamp.
*   **Low Latency:** The `get_order_book()` function must return results quickly.  Minimize the time it takes to retrieve the order book.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** The system should use memory efficiently, especially when dealing with a large number of active orders.
*   **Timestamp Handling:**  Account for the possibility of out-of-order events. You need to ensure that events are processed in the correct chronological order.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider scenarios such as:
    *   Duplicate order IDs (handle gracefully, e.g., ignore the later event).
    *   "cancel" or "execute" events for non-existent order IDs (handle gracefully, e.g., ignore the event).
    *   Zero or negative quantities in "execute" events (handle gracefully, e.g., ignore the event or raise an exception).
    *   Empty order book (return an empty list).
    *   `depth` larger than the number of available price levels.

**Example:**

Assume the following events are processed:

```
events = [
    (1678886400000, "order1", "buy", 100.0, 100, "new"),
    (1678886400001, "order2", "buy", 99.5, 50, "new"),
    (1678886400002, "order3", "sell", 100.5, 75, "new"),
    (1678886400003, "order1", "buy", 100.0, 50, "execute"), # Partially execute order1
    (1678886400004, "order4", "sell", 101.0, 25, "new"),
    (1678886400005, "order2", "buy", 99.5, 50, "cancel")  #cancel order2
]
```

Then:

```
get_order_book("buy", 2)  # Returns [(100.0, 50), (99.5, 0)] (order2 is canceled)
get_order_book("sell", 1) # Returns [(100.5, 75)]
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The order book must accurately reflect the current state based on all processed events.
*   **Performance:** The system should handle a large volume of events with low latency.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Handling of Edge Cases:** The system should gracefully handle all specified edge cases.
*   **Efficiency:** Efficient data structures and algorithms are required to pass, with O(log n) operations for most actions.

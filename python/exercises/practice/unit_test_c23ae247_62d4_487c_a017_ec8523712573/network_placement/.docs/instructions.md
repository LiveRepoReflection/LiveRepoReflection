Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to push Python coding skills.

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkPlacement`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a resilient and efficient communication network for a distributed data processing system. The system consists of `N` compute nodes, each with varying processing capabilities and data storage requirements. These nodes are geographically dispersed, and the cost of establishing a direct communication link between any two nodes is proportional to the Euclidean distance between them.

To ensure reliability, you need to place `K` redundant gateway servers within the network. These gateway servers act as intermediaries, allowing nodes to communicate even if direct links fail. Each compute node must be associated with exactly one gateway server. The latency of communication between a node and its assigned gateway is proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. You can place the gateway servers at arbitrary locations in the same geographical space as the compute nodes.

Your goal is to determine the optimal placement of the `K` gateway servers and the assignment of each compute node to a gateway server, such that the following objective function is minimized:

**Objective Function:** Minimize the maximum latency experienced by any node in the system. This maximum latency is defined as the largest Euclidean distance between any node and its assigned gateway server.

**Constraints:**

1.  `1 <= K <= N <= 1000`: The number of gateway servers is between 1 and the number of compute nodes.
2.  The coordinates of each node are integers in the range `[0, 1000]`.
3.  You must assign each compute node to exactly one gateway server.
4.  The placement of gateway servers is unconstrained, and their coordinates can be floating-point numbers.
5.  Solution must be found within a time limit (e.g., 60 seconds).
6. The solution must have an absolute error tolerance of `1e-6` for the objective function value when compared to an optimal solution.
7. You need to provide a scalable solution for increasing number of nodes.

**Input:**

A list of tuples representing the coordinates of the `N` compute nodes: `nodes = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xN, yN)]`
An integer `K` representing the number of gateway servers to place.

**Output:**

A tuple containing:

1.  A list of tuples representing the coordinates of the `K` gateway servers: `gateways = [(gx1, gy1), (gx2, gy2), ..., (gxK, gyK)]`
2.  A list of integers representing the assignment of each node to a gateway server (0-indexed).  For example, `assignments = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, ...]` means node 0 is assigned to gateway 0, node 1 is assigned to gateway 1, node 2 is assigned to gateway 0, node 3 is assigned to gateway 2, and so on.

**Example:**

```python
nodes = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (0, 2), (2, 2)]
K = 2
```

A possible (but not necessarily optimal) output:

```python
gateways = [(0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 1.5)]
assignments = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
```

**Judging:**

Your solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does your solution satisfy all the constraints and produce valid output?
*   **Optimality:** How close is the maximum latency achieved by your solution to the optimal maximum latency?
*   **Efficiency:** How quickly does your solution find a result? Solutions that time out will be considered incorrect.
*   **Scalability:** How well does your solution perform as the number of nodes increases?

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases. Good luck!

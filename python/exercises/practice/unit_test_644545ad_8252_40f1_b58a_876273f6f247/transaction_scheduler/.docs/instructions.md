Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a contestant's abilities with graph algorithms, optimization, and potentially some system design considerations.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Scheduling and Conflict Resolution

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a distributed database system where transactions can span multiple nodes. Each transaction consists of a set of operations that must be executed in a specific order. Each operation reads or writes to a specific data item located on a specific node.

You are given a log of transactions that have been submitted to the system. This log contains the following information for each transaction:

*   **Transaction ID (TID):** A unique identifier for the transaction.
*   **Node ID (NID):** The ID of the node where an operation is performed.
*   **Data Item (DI):** The data item being accessed or modified.
*   **Operation Type (OP):**  'R' for read, 'W' for write.
*   **Timestamp (TS):** The time at which the operation was attempted.

Due to the distributed nature and the concurrent execution of these transactions, conflicts can arise. A conflict occurs when two transactions try to access the same data item on the same node, and at least one of them is a write operation.  Conflicts need to be resolved to ensure data consistency and atomicity.

Your task is to design and implement a scheduling algorithm that maximizes the number of committed transactions while minimizing conflicts. You must determine a valid schedule for the transactions that respects the dependencies and ensures serializability (specifically, conflict serializability).

**Input:**

The input will be provided as a list of transaction logs. Each transaction log will be a list of tuples: `(TID, NID, DI, OP, TS)`.

For example:

```python
transaction_logs = [
    [(1, 1, 'A', 'W', 1), (1, 2, 'B', 'R', 3), (1, 1, 'C', 'R', 5)],  # Transaction 1
    [(2, 1, 'A', 'R', 2), (2, 2, 'C', 'W', 4), (2, 1, 'D', 'W', 6)],  # Transaction 2
    [(3, 2, 'B', 'W', 7), (3, 1, 'C', 'W', 8)],  # Transaction 3
]
```

**Output:**

Your algorithm should output a list of committed transaction IDs in a serializable order. If there are multiple possible serializable schedules, your algorithm should attempt to maximize the number of committed transactions. If a transaction cannot be committed without violating serializability, it should be aborted (not included in the output).

For the example input, a possible output might be:

```python
[1, 3]
```

(This implies that transaction 2 had to be aborted to maintain serializability).

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Scale:** The number of transactions and operations can be very large (up to 10^5 transactions, each with up to 100 operations). Your solution must be efficient.
*   **Conflict Detection:**  Efficiently detect conflicts between transactions.
*   **Serializability:**  Ensure that the final schedule is conflict serializable.  You can use techniques like conflict graphs to achieve this.
*   **Optimization:** Maximize the number of committed transactions. You may need to prioritize certain transactions over others based on factors like the number of operations or the number of conflicts they are involved in.
*   **Deadlock Detection/Prevention:**  Consider the possibility of deadlocks arising from cyclic dependencies in the conflict graph.  Implement a mechanism to detect and/or prevent deadlocks. You can abort transactions to break deadlocks.
*   **Timestamp Ordering:** While the timestamps are provided, you are not required to strictly adhere to a timestamp ordering protocol. However, they may be useful in making scheduling decisions or breaking ties.
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle cases where the input is invalid or inconsistent.
*   **Scalability:** Consider how your solution would scale to a larger, more complex distributed system with many more nodes and transactions. While you don't need to implement a fully distributed system, your algorithm should be designed with scalability in mind.
*   **Tie-breaking:** In cases where multiple schedules are possible with the same number of committed transactions, provide a deterministic way to choose one.

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency control techniques in distributed databases, graph algorithms, and optimization strategies. Good luck!

## Question Description

You are designing a core component of a high-performance network router. The router needs to efficiently determine the optimal path for forwarding packets across a complex network. The network is represented as a directed graph, where nodes are routers and edges represent communication links with associated costs (latency, bandwidth usage, etc.).

Your task is to implement a function `optimal_packet_route(network, source, destination, packet_size)` that finds the lowest-cost path for a packet to travel from a source router to a destination router in the network. The cost of a path is defined as the sum of the costs of the edges in the path *plus* a congestion penalty applied to each edge.

**Network Representation:**

The `network` is represented as a dictionary where:

*   Keys are router IDs (integers).
*   Values are dictionaries representing outgoing edges from that router.  Each inner dictionary has the following structure:
    *   Keys are destination router IDs (integers).
    *   Values are dictionaries containing edge information:
        *   `cost`: The base cost (integer) of using that edge.
        *   `bandwidth`: The available bandwidth (integer, in Mbps) of that edge.

**Input Parameters:**

*   `network`: A dictionary representing the network graph as described above.
*   `source`: The ID of the source router (integer).
*   `destination`: The ID of the destination router (integer).
*   `packet_size`: The size of the packet to be routed (integer, in MB).

**Congestion Penalty:**

The congestion penalty for an edge is calculated as follows:

1.  Calculate the bandwidth utilization ratio: `packet_size * 8 / bandwidth`.  (Convert packet size from MB to bits by multiplying by 8).
2.  If the bandwidth utilization ratio is greater than 0.8 (80% utilization), a congestion penalty is applied.
3.  The congestion penalty is calculated as `cost * (utilization_ratio - 0.8) * 5`.  This penalty is added to the base cost of the edge to get the total edge cost.
4.  If bandwidth is zero, consider the link broken and return an empty list.

**Output:**

The function should return a list of router IDs representing the optimal path from the source to the destination, **including the source and destination routers themselves**. If no path exists, return an empty list.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   The network can be large (hundreds or thousands of routers).
*   The algorithm must be efficient. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue).
*   Handle cases where the source and destination are the same router.
*   Handle disconnected networks (no path exists).
*   Handle negative edge costs (though this should be clearly specified in the problem description if you are planning to implement Bellman-Ford algorithm instead of Dijkstra).
*   Optimize for both time and memory complexity.
*   The solution must be robust and handle various edge cases.

**Example:**

```python
network = {
    1: {2: {'cost': 10, 'bandwidth': 100}, 3: {'cost': 15, 'bandwidth': 50}},
    2: {4: {'cost': 20, 'bandwidth': 200}},
    3: {4: {'cost': 5, 'bandwidth': 25}},
    4: {}
}

source = 1
destination = 4
packet_size = 1  # MB

optimal_packet_route(network, source, destination, packet_size)
# Expected output (one possible optimal path): [1, 2, 4] or [1, 3, 4] depending on the calculation of congestion penalty
```

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

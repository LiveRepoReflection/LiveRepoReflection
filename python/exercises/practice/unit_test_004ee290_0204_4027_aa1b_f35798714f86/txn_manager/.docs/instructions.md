Okay, here is your challenging Python coding problem:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Manager**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager that can coordinate atomic transactions across multiple independent data stores (simulated as Python dictionaries). Your system must ensure the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for all transactions.

**Details:**

Your transaction manager should handle the following:

1.  **Data Stores:** Assume you have `n` independent data stores represented as Python dictionaries. Each data store has a unique ID (integer).

2.  **Transactions:** A transaction consists of a sequence of operations to be performed across one or more data stores. Each operation is a tuple: `(data_store_id, operation_type, key, value)`.

    *   `data_store_id`: The ID of the data store to operate on.
    *   `operation_type`:  A string, either `"write"` or `"delete"`.
    *   `key`: The key to be written or deleted (string).
    *   `value`: The value to be written (string).  This is ignored for `"delete"` operations.

3.  **Concurrency:**  Multiple transactions can be initiated concurrently.  You must implement a locking mechanism to prevent race conditions and ensure isolation.  A simple lock per data store is sufficient.

4.  **Atomicity and Durability:** If a transaction commits, all its operations must be applied. If a transaction aborts (due to an exception or external signal), none of its operations must be applied. Implement a two-phase commit protocol (2PC) to achieve this. You need to simulate the logging needed for durability but don't need to implement actual file I/O.

5.  **Isolation:** Transactions must be isolated from each other. Reads should be repeatable within a transaction.  Implement strict two-phase locking (S2PL) to guarantee serializability.

6.  **Deadlock Detection/Prevention:**  Implement a simple deadlock detection mechanism (e.g., timeout-based). If a transaction waits for a lock longer than a specified timeout, it should abort. (or prevention, your choice, state which you do)

7.  **Error Handling:** Your transaction manager should handle potential errors gracefully, such as:

    *   Data store not found.
    *   Key not found during a delete operation.
    *   Deadlock situation.
    *   Transaction aborted by external signal.

8.  **API:** Implement the following methods:

    *   `begin_transaction()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique transaction ID.
    *   `add_operation(transaction_id, data_store_id, operation_type, key, value=None)`: Adds an operation to the specified transaction.
    *   `commit_transaction(transaction_id)`: Attempts to commit the specified transaction.
    *   `abort_transaction(transaction_id)`: Aborts the specified transaction.
    *   `get_data_store(data_store_id)`: Returns the data_store with the specified ID.

**Constraints:**

*   **Efficiency:**  Your implementation should be reasonably efficient. Avoid unnecessary locking or copying of data. Think about how to structure your data to optimize common operations.
*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to handle massive scale, consider how your design could be extended to support more data stores and concurrent transactions.
*   **Concurrency Safety:**  Your code must be thread-safe.
*   **No External Libraries:** You are allowed to use standard Python libraries for threading, locking, and basic data structures, but **no external transaction management or database libraries are permitted.** The point is to implement the core transaction management logic yourself.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a global deadlock detection mechanism (e.g., using a wait-for graph).
*   Add support for read operations within transactions, ensuring repeatable reads.
*   Implement a more sophisticated locking scheme (e.g., row-level locking).
*   Add crash recovery mechanism to recover from the transaction logs.

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, locking, and distributed transaction management concepts. It's a challenging but rewarding exercise in system design and implementation. Good luck!

## Question Description:

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service. This service is crucial for protecting backend systems from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. The service should be horizontally scalable, highly available, and provide strong guarantees about rate limiting.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Functionality:**
    *   The rate limiter should allow a configurable number of requests (`N`) within a specific time window (`T`).
    *   The service should provide a `check_and_increment(user_id, api_endpoint)` method/function. This method should atomically check if the rate limit for a given `user_id` and `api_endpoint` has been exceeded. If not, it increments the request count and returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
    *   The time window `T` should be configurable and support units such as seconds, minutes, hours, and days.
    *   The maximum value of `N` can be up to 10000 and the maximum value of `T` can be up to 86400 seconds (1 day).

2.  **Distribution and Scalability:**
    *   The service must be designed to handle a large number of requests per second (at least 10,000 RPS) and scale horizontally to accommodate increasing load.
    *   Data should be distributed across multiple nodes to avoid single points of failure and ensure even load distribution.
    *   Consider how to handle data consistency across different nodes.

3.  **Data Consistency and Atomicity:**
    *   The `check_and_increment` operation must be atomic to prevent race conditions when multiple requests arrive concurrently for the same `user_id` and `api_endpoint`.
    *   The rate limiter should provide strong guarantees about not exceeding the configured rate limits, even under heavy load and in the presence of node failures.

4.  **Fault Tolerance and High Availability:**
    *   The service should be resilient to node failures. If one or more nodes go down, the system should continue to operate correctly without significant performance degradation.
    *   Consider how to handle data replication and failover to ensure high availability.

5.  **Efficiency:**
    *   The `check_and_increment` operation should be as fast as possible to minimize latency.
    *   The data structures used for storing rate limit information should be efficient in terms of both memory and lookup time.

6.  **Configuration:**
    *   The rate limits (`N` and `T`) should be configurable on a per-`user_id` and/or per-`api_endpoint` basis.  A default rate limit should apply if specific configurations aren't found.
    *   Configuration changes should be applied dynamically without restarting the service.

7.  **Advanced Considerations (Optional, but highly beneficial):**
    *   Implement a mechanism to prevent abuse, such as detecting and blocking malicious users or API keys.
    *   Provide metrics and monitoring capabilities to track the performance of the rate limiter, such as request rate, error rate, and latency.
    *   Implement dynamic rate limiting based on system load or other factors. For example, if the backend systems are under heavy load, the rate limiter could automatically reduce the rate limits.
    *   Consider using a sliding window algorithm for more accurate rate limiting.

**Constraints:**

*   You can use any appropriate data structures and algorithms.
*   You can use any appropriate external libraries or services, but justify your choices. For example, consider the trade-offs between using Redis, Memcached, or a custom in-memory data store.
*   Assume the `user_id` and `api_endpoint` are strings.
*   Assume a reasonable network latency between the rate limiter service and the backend systems it protects.
*   Your solution should be demonstrably thread-safe and prevent race conditions.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The rate limiter must accurately enforce the configured rate limits.
*   Performance: The `check_and_increment` operation should be fast and efficient.
*   Scalability: The service should be able to handle a large number of requests per second and scale horizontally.
*   Fault Tolerance: The service should be resilient to node failures.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Design Justification: You should be able to explain your design choices and the trade-offs involved.

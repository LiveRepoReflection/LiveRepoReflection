Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem:

**Problem Title: Optimal Traffic Flow Routing**

**Problem Description:**

A major city is implementing a new intelligent traffic management system.  Your task is to develop an algorithm to optimize traffic flow by dynamically routing vehicles. The city is represented as a weighted directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent intersections.
*   Edges represent road segments connecting intersections.
*   Edge weights represent the *estimated* travel time (in seconds) along that road segment at the *current* time. These times are updated in real-time based on sensor data.

You are given:

1.  A graph represented as a dictionary where keys are intersection IDs (integers), and values are dictionaries mapping neighbor intersection IDs to the current travel time (an integer) and the road segment's capacity (an integer representing the maximum number of vehicles allowed on that road segment).
    ```python
    graph = {
        0: {1: {'time': 10, 'capacity': 50}, 2: {'time': 15, 'capacity': 30}},
        1: {3: {'time': 20, 'capacity': 40}},
        2: {3: {'time': 12, 'capacity': 20}, 4: {'time': 8, 'capacity': 60}},
        3: {4: {'time': 5, 'capacity': 25}},
        4: {}
    }
    ```
2.  A list of vehicle requests. Each request is a tuple: `(start_intersection, end_intersection, departure_time)`.  `departure_time` is an integer representing the time (in seconds from the simulation start) when the vehicle begins its journey.
    ```python
    requests = [(0, 4, 0), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 10)]
    ```
3.  A simulation duration (in seconds).
4.  A function `get_capacity(graph, u, v, time)` that returns the current number of vehicles on the road segment (u,v) at given time.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 1000 intersections and 5000 road segments).
*   The number of vehicle requests can be substantial (up to 10,000 requests).
*   Travel times on road segments are updated every second. This means you need to re-evaluate routes frequently.
*   Road segments have a capacity. If a road segment is at full capacity, you **cannot** route a vehicle through it. Assume `get_capacity(graph, u, v, time)` is called at the start of each time step to determine the current vehicle count on road `(u, v)`.
*   Vehicles do not instantaneously move between intersections. They take time to travel along a road segment.
*   You need to minimize the *average* travel time for all vehicles that successfully reach their destination within the simulation duration.
*   Vehicles that cannot reach their destination within the simulation duration are considered "lost" and should be penalized heavily in the average travel time calculation (e.g., assign them a travel time equal to the simulation duration).
*   The solution must be reasonably efficient.  Brute-force approaches that recalculate routes for every vehicle at every time step are unlikely to pass within the time limit.
*   Assume that a vehicle takes one unit of time to move from one node to another.
*   There might not always be a path between a start and end intersection, even if capacity is not an issue.
*   The road segment capacity affects all vehicles traveling on that road segment, irrespective of their destination.

**Output:**

Your function should return the *average* travel time (in seconds) for all vehicles, considering the penalties for "lost" vehicles.

**Example:**

Given the graph and requests above, and a simulation duration of 60 seconds, your function should return a float representing the average travel time.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated on:

*   Correctness: Does it produce the correct average travel time?
*   Efficiency: Does it handle large graphs and a high volume of requests within a reasonable time?
*   Optimality: Does it effectively minimize the average travel time by dynamically routing vehicles?

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a priority queue (heap) for pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's or A\*. Adapt these algorithms to incorporate real-time travel time updates and capacity constraints.
*   Implement a mechanism to efficiently update routes only when necessary (e.g., when travel times on relevant road segments change significantly). Caching route information might be useful but be mindful of staleness.
*   Think about how to handle vehicles that are already en route when a travel time update occurs.
*   Consider alternative routing algorithms if Dijkstra/A\* proves too slow for large graphs.
*   Think about how to penalize "lost" vehicles correctly in the average travel time calculation.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques to achieve a good solution. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a variety of skills:

**Project Name:** `OptimalTradeNetwork`

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are designing the core infrastructure for a decentralized global trading network. This network connects various trading hubs (represented as nodes) across the world, facilitating the exchange of goods and services. Each hub has a limited capacity for handling trades and varying transaction costs (gas fees, taxes, etc.) associated with routing trades through it.

You are given a directed graph representing this trade network. Each node in the graph represents a trading hub, and each directed edge represents a potential trading route between two hubs. Each edge has two associated weights:

1.  **`capacity`:** An integer representing the maximum amount of trade (in some abstract unit) that can flow through that route.
2.  **`cost`:** A floating-point number representing the cost per unit of trade flowing through that route.

You are given a source trading hub (`source`) and a destination trading hub (`destination`). You are also given a demand (`amount`) representing the total amount of trade that needs to be routed from the source to the destination.

Your task is to determine the *minimum total cost* to route the required `amount` of trade from the `source` to the `destination`, respecting the capacity constraints of each route.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Optimization:** The solution must be as efficient as possible. Brute-force approaches will not pass the time limit. Consider efficient algorithms and data structures.
2.  **Complete Flow:** If it is impossible to route the entire `amount` of trade from the source to the destination due to capacity constraints, return `-1.0`. You should maximize the flow before returning -1.0. The amount of flow that can be routed should be used to calculate the total cost.
3.  **Multiple Paths:** The optimal solution may involve splitting the trade across multiple paths from the source to the destination.
4.  **Large Network:** The graph can be quite large (up to 1000 nodes and 5000 edges).
5.  **Floating-Point Precision:** Cost calculations should be precise enough to avoid significant rounding errors. Use appropriate data types and techniques to minimize these errors.
6.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as disconnected graphs, zero capacity edges, and cases where the source and destination are the same.

**Input:**

*   `num_nodes`: An integer representing the number of trading hubs (nodes). Nodes are numbered from 0 to `num_nodes - 1`.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a directed edge: `(source_node, destination_node, capacity, cost)`.
*   `source`: An integer representing the index of the source trading hub.
*   `destination`: An integer representing the index of the destination trading hub.
*   `amount`: A floating-point number representing the total amount of trade to be routed.

**Output:**

*   A floating-point number representing the minimum total cost to route the required `amount` of trade. Return `-1.0` if it's impossible to route the entire amount.

This problem combines graph algorithms (finding paths, maximum flow), optimization techniques (minimizing cost), and careful handling of constraints and edge cases, making it a challenging and sophisticated problem for experienced programmers.

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test advanced Python skills:

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkReconfiguration`

## Question Description

You are given a representation of a communication network as a set of servers and the latency between them.  The network is represented by:

1.  `num_servers`: An integer representing the total number of servers in the network, numbered from 0 to `num_servers - 1`.

2.  `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a bidirectional connection between server `u` and server `v` with a latency of `w`.  Latencies are non-negative integers.  There can be multiple edges between the same pair of servers, and self-loops are allowed (u == v).

3.  `critical_edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a critical connection between server `u` and server `v`.  These connections *must* be present in the reconfigured network.

Your task is to reconfigure the network to minimize the *maximum latency* between any two directly connected servers, while ensuring that all critical connections are maintained. The reconfiguration is achieved by removing existing edges and adding new edges.

**Constraints:**

*   The reconfigured network must be connected (there must be a path between any two servers).
*   All critical edges *must* be present in the reconfigured network. Their latency can be changed.
*   The reconfigured network can contain edges that weren't present in the original network.
*   You can add or remove any number of edges, as long as the above constraints are met.
*   The latency of any edge must be a non-negative integer.
*   The latency of a newly added edge can be different from the latency of an edge in the original graph connecting the same two servers.
*   The goal is to minimize the *maximum latency* value of any edge in the *reconfigured* network.

**Input:**

*   `num_servers`: An integer.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)`.
*   `critical_edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v)`.

**Output:**

An integer representing the *minimum possible* maximum latency value achievable in a valid reconfiguration. If a valid reconfiguration is not possible, return `-1`.

**Example:**

```python
num_servers = 3
edges = [(0, 1, 5), (1, 2, 3), (0, 2, 10)]
critical_edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2)]

# Possible optimal reconfiguration:
# Edges: [(0, 1, x), (1, 2, y), (0, 2, z)]  where x, y and z are the optimized latency
# One optimal solution is to set latency as small as possible while ensuring connectivity
# Minimum possible maximum latency: 5
```

**Scoring:**

*   Correctness: Your solution must produce the correct minimum maximum latency for all test cases.
*   Efficiency: Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large networks.  A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using graph algorithms like Minimum Spanning Trees or Shortest Paths as building blocks.
*   Think about how to efficiently determine if a network is connected.
*   Binary search could be helpful in finding the minimum possible maximum latency.
*   The critical edges impose a lower bound on the connectivity of the graph.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph theory, algorithmic optimization, and careful handling of edge cases. Good luck!

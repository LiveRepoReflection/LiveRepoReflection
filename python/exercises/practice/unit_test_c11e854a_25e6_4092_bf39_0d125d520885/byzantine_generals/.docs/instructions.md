## The Byzantine Agreement with Faulty Generals

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you are a supreme commander coordinating an attack on a heavily fortified city. You have `n` generals, including yourself (so `n >= 1`), positioned around the city. To succeed, you need a coordinated attack. However, some of your generals might be traitors, actively working to sabotage the mission. They might send conflicting orders or refuse to send any order at all.

The goal is to design an algorithm that allows the loyal generals to reach a consensus on a single attack plan (either 'Attack' or 'Retreat'), even in the presence of up to `m` traitorous generals. You, as the supreme commander, send an initial order to all generals.

**Formal Definition:**

Given:

*   `n`: The total number of generals (including the commander).
*   `m`: The maximum number of traitorous generals (`m < n/3`).  This is a crucial constraint.
*   `initial_order`: The supreme commander's initial order ('Attack' or 'Retreat').
*   `general_is_traitor(general_id)`: A function (in a real-world scenario, this would be unknown to the generals; for the problem, it can be used for simulation/testing) that returns `True` if a general with `general_id` is a traitor, and `False` otherwise. `general_id` ranges from `0` (commander) to `n-1`.

Your task is to implement a function `byzantine_agreement(n, m, initial_order, general_is_traitor)` that returns the final agreed-upon order ('Attack' or 'Retreat') by the loyal generals.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Agreement:** All loyal generals must decide on the same order.
2.  **Validity:** If the commander is loyal, all loyal generals must follow the commander's initial order.
3.  **Maximum Traitors:** The algorithm must work correctly even if there are up to `m` traitorous generals.
4.  **Communication:** Generals can only communicate by sending orders/messages to each other. These messages can be relayed.
5.  **Faulty Messages:** Traitorous generals can send different messages to different generals, or send no message at all.
6.  **Efficiency:** While absolute time complexity isn't the primary focus, the algorithm should be reasonably efficient. Exponential time solutions are discouraged. Aim for polynomial time complexity in `n`.
7.  **No Shared Secrets:** The generals do not share any secret information or cryptographic keys before the protocol begins.
8.  **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** The algorithm must be resilient to Byzantine failures (arbitrary and malicious behavior of the traitors).
9.  **Practical Considerations:**
    *   You need to simulate the message passing between the generals.
    *   You need to handle the scenario where some generals might not receive messages from others (due to traitorous generals or network issues).
10. **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle the case where `n` is very small (e.g., `n = 1, 2, 3`).  The condition `m < n/3` must always hold.

**Note:** This is a challenging problem that requires careful consideration of all possible scenarios. There might be multiple valid approaches, with varying levels of complexity and efficiency. Some approaches might involve recursion, message passing rounds, and majority voting. Good luck!

## Question: Resilient Distributed Key-Value Store

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a resilient, distributed key-value store. The store should handle a massive number of concurrent requests, tolerate node failures, and maintain data consistency.

The system consists of `N` nodes (where `N` can be a large number, e.g., 1000+), each having limited storage capacity. The key-value store must support the following operations:

*   `put(key, value)`: Stores the `value` associated with the given `key`. The `key` and `value` can be arbitrarily large strings.
*   `get(key)`: Retrieves the `value` associated with the given `key`. Returns `None` if the `key` does not exist.
*   `delete(key)`: Deletes the `key` and its associated `value`.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Data Distribution:** Implement a consistent hashing scheme to distribute keys across the nodes.  Consider how to handle node additions and removals while minimizing data movement.

2.  **Replication:** Implement data replication to ensure fault tolerance. Each key-value pair should be replicated across `R` nodes (where `R < N`).  You need to handle the scenario where some replica nodes are unavailable.

3.  **Consistency:** Implement a mechanism to ensure eventual consistency.  When a `put` operation is successful, subsequent `get` operations should eventually return the updated value.  Explain the consistency model you're implementing (e.g., read-your-writes, session consistency, eventual consistency).  Consider vector clocks or similar techniques to help resolve conflicts.

4.  **Failure Handling:** The system must be resilient to node failures. When a node fails, the system should automatically redistribute its data to other nodes to maintain the desired replication factor.

5.  **Performance:** The system should be optimized for high read and write throughput.  Consider caching strategies and techniques for parallelizing operations. Optimize for the common case of reads being much more frequent than writes.

6.  **Scalability:** The system should be scalable to handle a growing number of keys and nodes.

7.  **Concurrency:** The system must handle concurrent requests from multiple clients. Implement appropriate locking or concurrency control mechanisms to prevent data corruption.

8.  **Key Size:** Keys can be very large (up to 1MB). Consider the impact of large keys on your data distribution and replication strategies.

9.  **Node Discovery:** Assume there is a separate mechanism (e.g., a ZooKeeper-like service) for node discovery and membership management.  You don't need to implement this service, but your system should be able to use its information to maintain an up-to-date view of the cluster.  Assume the `get_node_list()` function is provided, which returns a list of available node IPs.

10. **Latency:** The system must be able to handle requests with low latency.

**Specifically, you must implement the following functions in Python:**

```python
class DistributedKVStore:
    def __init__(self, node_id, get_node_list_func):
        """
        Initializes the distributed key-value store.

        Args:
            node_id: A unique identifier for this node (e.g., IP address).
            get_node_list_func: A function that returns a list of available node IPs.
        """
        pass

    def put(self, key, value):
        """
        Stores the value associated with the given key.

        Args:
            key: The key.
            value: The value.
        """
        pass

    def get(self, key):
        """
        Retrieves the value associated with the given key.

        Args:
            key: The key.

        Returns:
            The value associated with the key, or None if the key does not exist.
        """
        pass

    def delete(self, key):
        """
        Deletes the key and its associated value.

        Args:
            key: The key.
        """
        pass
```

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for data versioning.
*   Implement a background process to actively repair data inconsistencies.
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the health and performance of the cluster.

This is a system design problem with a heavy coding component. You should focus on the core functionality and trade-offs involved in building a resilient and scalable distributed key-value store. Your solution will be evaluated based on correctness, performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and code quality.

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a candidate's ability to work with graphs, optimize solutions, and handle real-world constraints.

## Problem:  Optimal Meeting Point in a Dynamic City

### Description

Imagine a city represented as a weighted, undirected graph.  Each node in the graph represents a location (e.g., a building, a park), and each edge represents a road connecting two locations with a specific travel time (weight).

You are tasked with finding the optimal meeting point for a group of people in this city.  "Optimal" is defined as minimizing the *maximum* travel time any individual in the group has to reach the meeting point.  In other words, you want to minimize the worst-case travel time for anyone in the group.  This is also known as minimizing the eccentricity of the chosen vertex relative to the group.

However, the city is *dynamic*. Road closures occur frequently, changing the travel times (edge weights) between locations. You will receive a series of update operations that modify the graph's edge weights.  After each update, you must efficiently determine the new optimal meeting point for the group.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of locations (nodes) in the city, numbered from 0 to `n-1`.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents an undirected road between location `u` and location `v` with travel time `w`.  Assume `0 <= u < n`, `0 <= v < n`, `u != v`, and `w > 0`.  The initial graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   `group`: A list of integers representing the locations of the people in the group. Assume each location in `group` is a valid node in the graph. The group will always contain at least one person.
*   `updates`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, new_w)` represents an update to the graph.  It means the travel time between location `u` and location `v` is updated to `new_w`. `new_w` can be 0, which implies the road is closed. If the road is closed and it is necessary to reach the meeting point, the meeting can't happen.

**Output:**

A list of integers. For each update in `updates`, output the index of the optimal meeting point node (minimizing the maximum travel time for anyone in the group to reach it). If the graph is disconnected for any of the group member from the meeting point after an update, return `-1` for that update. If there are multiple optimal meeting points, return the one with the smallest index.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= len(edges) <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `1 <= len(group) <= n`
*   `1 <= len(updates) <= 100`
*   `1 <= w <= 1000` (initial edge weights)
*   `0 <= new_w <= 1000` (updated edge weights)

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 4), (2, 4, 8), (3,4,3)]
group = [0, 3]
updates = [(1, 2, 5), (0, 1, 1)]

Output: [2, 4]
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Initial graph:** The shortest paths from 0 to all nodes are [0, 3, 2, 7, 10] and from 3 to all nodes are [7, 4, 5, 0, 3].
*   **Update 1: (1, 2, 5)** The edge between nodes 1 and 2 is updated to 5.
    *   If we choose node 0 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(0,7) = 7.
    *   If we choose node 1 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(3,4) = 4.
    *   If we choose node 2 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(2,5) = 5.
    *   If we choose node 3 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(7,0) = 7.
    *   If we choose node 4 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(10,3) = 10.
    *   Therefore, node 1 is the optimal meeting point with a maximum travel time of 4.
*   **Update 2: (0, 1, 1)** The edge between nodes 0 and 1 is updated to 1.
    *   If we choose node 0 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(0,7) = 7.
    *   If we choose node 1 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(1,4) = 4.
    *   If we choose node 2 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(2,5) = 5.
    *   If we choose node 3 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(6,0) = 6.
    *   If we choose node 4 as the meeting point, the maximum travel time is max(9,3) = 9.
    *   Therefore, node 1 is the optimal meeting point with a maximum travel time of 4.

**Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:**  A naive solution that recalculates shortest paths from scratch for every node after each update will likely be too slow for larger graphs and many updates.  Think about how to optimize the shortest path calculations or leverage previous calculations.
*   **Disconnected graphs:** Handle the case where the graph becomes disconnected after an update. If any group member cannot reach a potential meeting point, that point is invalid.
*   **Multiple optimal points:** When multiple meeting points result in the same minimum maximum travel time, choose the location with the smallest index.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms (shortest paths), data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

## Question Description

A futuristic city, *Veridia*, is implementing a new smart ride-sharing system. The city is represented as a weighted, undirected graph where nodes are intersections and edges are roads connecting them. Each road has a *dynamic* traffic cost associated with it that changes throughout the day.

You are tasked with designing an efficient algorithm to optimize ride sharing in Veridia. Given a series of ride requests, your system should efficiently find the *k* best routes for each request, considering the current traffic conditions.

**Ride Request:** Each ride request consists of a start intersection (node), an end intersection (node), a departure time, and the number *k* of best routes required.

**Dynamic Traffic:** The traffic cost of each road (edge) is a function of time. You are given a function `get_traffic_cost(intersection1, intersection2, timestamp)` that returns the traffic cost between two intersections at a given timestamp. This function is external and cannot be modified.  It is guaranteed to be accurate, but potentially expensive to call.  Assume that the traffic cost remains constant for the duration of a trip.

**Route Cost:** The cost of a route is the sum of the traffic costs of all roads along the route, considering the departure time of the ride request.

**Optimization Requirements:**

1.  **Efficiency:** Finding the *k* best routes for each request needs to be highly efficient, especially considering the large scale of the city and the number of concurrent ride requests.  Minimize the number of calls to `get_traffic_cost()`.

2.  **Accuracy:** The algorithm must return the *k* routes with the lowest possible cost, considering the dynamic traffic conditions.

3.  **Scalability:** The solution should scale well to handle a large number of intersections and ride requests.

**Constraints:**

*   The city graph can have up to 10,000 intersections and 50,000 roads.
*   The value of *k* can be up to 10.
*   The departure time is represented as an integer timestamp.
*   The traffic cost is a non-negative integer.
*   The `get_traffic_cost()` function has a time complexity that is greater than O(1) so it should be called sparingly.
*   You are allowed to pre-process the graph data to build auxiliary data structures.

**Input:**

*   A description of the city graph (intersections and roads with their initial traffic costs â€“ these initial costs are only for pre-processing; the `get_traffic_cost()` function should be used for actual route cost calculation).
*   A list of ride requests, each containing:
    *   `start_intersection`
    *   `end_intersection`
    *   `departure_time`
    *   `k`

**Output:**

*   For each ride request, output a list of the *k* best routes (list of intersections in order) and their corresponding costs, sorted in ascending order of cost. If fewer than *k* valid routes exist, return all available routes.

**Example:**

```python
# Example get_traffic_cost function (provided to the candidate - UNMODIFIABLE)
def get_traffic_cost(intersection1, intersection2, timestamp):
  # Simulate dynamic traffic costs
  base_cost = abs(intersection1 - intersection2)
  time_penalty = (timestamp % 24)  # Traffic fluctuates throughout the day
  return base_cost + time_penalty

# Example ride request
ride_request = {
    "start_intersection": 1,
    "end_intersection": 5,
    "departure_time": 10,
    "k": 3
}

# Expected Output (Structure - actual values will vary based on implementation)
[
    {"route": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "cost": 25},
    {"route": [1, 6, 7, 8, 5], "cost": 28},
    {"route": [1, 5], "cost": 30}
]

```

**Considerations:**

*   How will you represent the graph?
*   Which graph search algorithm(s) will you use to find the *k* best routes? (Consider A*, Dijkstra's, etc.)
*   How will you efficiently handle the dynamic traffic costs?  Can you pre-compute anything to reduce the number of calls to `get_traffic_cost()`?
*   How will you manage memory usage, especially given the potentially large graph?

This problem combines graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and real-world constraints, making it a challenging and comprehensive test of a candidate's programming skills. Good luck!

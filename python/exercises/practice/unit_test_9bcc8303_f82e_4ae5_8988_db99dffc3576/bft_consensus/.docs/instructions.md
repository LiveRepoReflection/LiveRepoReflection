## Question: Distributed Consensus with Byzantine Fault Tolerance

### Question Description

You are designing a critical component for a highly distributed, decentralized financial system. This system requires a robust consensus mechanism that can tolerate Byzantine faults â€“ where some nodes in the network may be malicious and actively try to disrupt the consensus process by sending incorrect or contradictory information.

Your task is to implement a simplified version of a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm. Assume a network of `n` nodes, where `f` nodes can be faulty (Byzantine).  The algorithm needs to achieve consensus on a single binary value (0 or 1) proposed by a designated "proposer" node.

**Simplified BFT Algorithm:**

1.  **Propose:** The proposer node broadcasts a proposed value (0 or 1) to all other nodes.
2.  **Vote:** Each node (including the proposer) votes for the value it received from the proposer. If a node receives no value or an invalid value, it can abstain or vote for a default value (e.g., 0). Each node then broadcasts its vote to all other nodes.
3.  **Commit:** Each node collects the votes from all `n` nodes. A node commits to a value if it receives more than `(2n + f)/3` votes for that value. If a node cannot commit to a value, it remains undecided.

**Implementation Details:**

You are given the following:

*   `n`: The total number of nodes in the network.
*   `f`: The maximum number of faulty nodes (Byzantine nodes).  You can assume `f < n/3` to ensure a practical level of fault tolerance.
*   `proposer_id`: The ID of the proposer node (0 to n-1).
*   `node_id`: The ID of the current node (0 to n-1).
*   `proposed_value`: The value proposed by the proposer node (0 or 1), or `None` if the current node is the proposer.
*   `received_values`: A list of values received by the current node from the proposer. Some entries in this list may be `None` to indicate no message received or invalid values, or different values. The list length is `n` and is indexed by node ID.

**Your task is to write a function `bft_consensus(n, f, proposer_id, node_id, proposed_value, received_values)` that returns the consensus value (0 or 1) if the node can commit to a value. If the node cannot commit, return `None`.**

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Safety:** The algorithm must guarantee that no two honest nodes commit to different values.
*   **Liveness:** If the proposer is honest and a sufficient number of nodes are honest, the algorithm should eventually reach a consensus.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The algorithm must tolerate up to `f` Byzantine faults.
*   **Efficiency:** Strive for an efficient implementation, considering the number of nodes and the complexity of the operations. Avoid unnecessary computations or data structures.
*   **Correctness:** The solution must correctly handle various scenarios, including cases where the proposer is faulty, messages are lost, or nodes send conflicting information.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider cases where the proposer is faulty, the number of nodes is small, or the received values are inconsistent.
*   **`received_values` Structure:** The index of `received_values` corresponds to the node's id, for example, the first item of `received_values` is the value that node 0 (with `node_id` as 0) received.
*   **Strict Adherence to the Algorithm:** The solution must faithfully implement the described simplified BFT algorithm. No creative interpretations are allowed.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed consensus, Byzantine fault tolerance, and careful attention to detail in the implementation. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem:

**Problem Title:** Scalable Social Network Influence Maximization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a system to identify the most influential users in a large social network. The social network is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent users and edges represent influence relationships (e.g., follows, retweets, mentions). Each edge has a weight between 0 and 1, representing the probability that one user's action will influence the connected user.

Given a social network graph and a budget *k*, select a set of *k* seed users to maximize the expected influence spread across the network. The influence spreads probabilistically. When a user is "activated" (either as a seed or by influence), they have a single chance to activate their neighbors. The probability of activating a neighbor is the weight of the edge connecting them. Activation spreads in discrete time steps. An activated user at time *t* has a chance to activate their neighbors at time *t+1*.

**Input:**

*   A directed graph represented as a list of edges. Each edge is a tuple `(u, v, w)`, where `u` and `v` are integers representing user IDs, and `w` is a float representing the influence probability (0 <= w <= 1). User IDs are non-negative integers.
*   An integer *k*, representing the budget (the number of seed users to select).
*   An integer *iterations*, representing the number of Monte Carlo simulations to run for estimating the influence spread.

**Output:**

*   A list of *k* integers, representing the IDs of the selected seed users. The order of users in the list does not matter.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scale:** The social network can be extremely large (millions of users and edges).
*   **Efficiency:** Finding the absolute optimal solution is NP-hard. You must implement an efficient approximation algorithm. Solutions must be reasonably fast.
*   **Probabilistic Nature:** Influence spread is probabilistic, requiring Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected influence. The number of iterations used in the Monte Carlo simulations greatly impacts the running time and accuracy of your result.
*   **Edge Cases:** The graph might be disconnected, contain cycles, or have isolated nodes. Handle these cases gracefully.
*   **Optimization:** Focus on selecting seed users that lead to the largest cascade of activations within a reasonable timeframe.
*   **Memory constraints:** Large graphs require memory-efficient representations and algorithms. Consider using sparse data structures if necessary.
*   **Approximation Quality:** Your solution will be evaluated based on the quality of seed set it returns, measured by the expected influence spread, given the computational constraints (running time and memory usage).

**Grading:**

Your solution will be judged on both correctness and efficiency. Submissions will be tested against a variety of test cases with varying graph sizes and structures. Performance will be measured by the expected influence spread achieved within a time limit. Solutions that time out or exceed memory limits will receive a lower score.

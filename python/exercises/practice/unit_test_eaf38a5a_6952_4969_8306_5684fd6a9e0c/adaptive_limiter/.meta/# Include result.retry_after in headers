## Edge Cases

The implementation handles:

- Redis failures with retry and failover
- Time synchronization issues with generous window overlap
- Sudden traffic spikes with trend analysis
- Metric collection failures with default values

## Testing Strategy

Testing includes:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Stress tests under high load
3. Fault injection for Redis failures
4. Clock drift simulation
5. Distributed operation verification

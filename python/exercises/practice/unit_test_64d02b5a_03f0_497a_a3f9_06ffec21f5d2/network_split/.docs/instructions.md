## Question: Optimal Network Splitting

### Question Description

A large telecommunications company, "GlobalConnect," manages a massive network of interconnected routers. Due to increasing demand and security concerns, GlobalConnect needs to divide its existing network into several smaller, isolated sub-networks. Each router in the original network must belong to exactly one sub-network.

The original network is represented as an undirected graph where nodes represent routers and edges represent direct connections between them.

GlobalConnect has identified a set of "critical routers". Separating critical routers into different sub-networks is highly desirable for redundancy and security. However, each sub-network needs to maintain a minimum level of connectivity. GlobalConnect defines a metric called "sub-network density" as the ratio of existing edges within the sub-network to the maximum possible number of edges within that sub-network (assuming a simple, undirected graph with no self-loops or multi-edges).

**Your task is to devise an algorithm to partition the original network into sub-networks, satisfying the following constraints:**

1.  **Completeness:** Every router must belong to exactly one sub-network.
2.  **Critical Router Separation (Weighted):** Each pair of critical routers belonging to the same sub-network incurs a penalty. The penalty is the square of the number of routers in that sub-network. This penalty should be minimized.
3.  **Minimum Density:** Each sub-network must have a density greater than or equal to a given threshold *D*.
4.  **Size Limit:** No sub-network can contain more than *M* routers.

**Input:**

*   *N*: The number of routers in the network (numbered from 0 to N-1).
*   *E*: A list of tuples representing the edges in the network. Each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between router *u* and router *v*.
*   *C*: A set of integers representing the indices of the critical routers.
*   *D*: The minimum density threshold for each sub-network (0 <= D <= 1).
*   *M*: The maximum allowed size of a sub-network.

**Output:**

A list of sets, where each set represents a sub-network and contains the indices of the routers belonging to that sub-network.

**Objective:**

Find a partitioning of the network that satisfies all the constraints and minimizes the total penalty incurred due to critical routers being in the same sub-network. If no valid partitioning exists, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 200
*   0 <= len(E) <= N * (N - 1) / 2
*   0 <= len(C) <= N
*   0 <= D <= 1
*   1 <= M <= N
*   The input graph is guaranteed to be connected.

**Example:**

```
N = 6
E = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
C = {0, 3, 5}
D = 0.4
M = 4

```

One possible valid output (though not necessarily optimal) could be:

```
[{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5}]
```

**Rationale for Difficulty:**

*   **NP-Hard Nature:** The problem inherently involves partitioning a graph with constraints, suggesting it might be related to NP-hard problems like graph partitioning or clustering.
*   **Conflicting Objectives:** Minimizing the penalty for critical routers conflicts with maintaining a minimum density, requiring a careful trade-off.
*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Satisfying all constraints simultaneously can be computationally challenging, especially with the size limit.
*   **Search Space:** The number of possible network partitions grows exponentially with the number of routers, making brute-force approaches infeasible for larger networks.
*   **Optimization:** Finding the optimal solution requires exploring the search space intelligently, potentially using heuristics, approximation algorithms, or advanced optimization techniques. This will require careful algorithm design and implementation.

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and real-world considerations.

### Project Name

`DistributedLogAnalysis`

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a simplified distributed log analysis system. Imagine a cluster of machines, each generating log entries. These log entries are timestamped and contain various fields. Your system needs to efficiently answer queries about these logs.

Specifically, your system will receive log entries from multiple sources (machines) and must support the following query:

**Query:** Given a time range (`start_time`, `end_time`) and a set of machine IDs, find all log entries within that time range originating from those specific machines.

**Input:**

1.  **Log Entries (Stream):**  A stream of log entries arrives continuously. Each log entry is a tuple: `(timestamp, machine_id, log_level, message)`.
    *   `timestamp`: An integer representing the timestamp of the log entry (e.g., seconds since epoch).
    *   `machine_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the machine that generated the log entry.
    *   `log_level`: A string representing the log level (e.g., "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR").
    *   `message`: A string containing the log message.

2.  **Queries:** Queries arrive in the following format: `(start_time, end_time, machine_ids)`.
    *   `start_time`: An integer representing the start of the time range (inclusive).
    *   `end_time`: An integer representing the end of the time range (inclusive).
    *   `machine_ids`: A set of strings representing the machine IDs to filter for.

**Output:**

For each query, return a list of log entries (as tuples) that satisfy the query criteria, sorted by timestamp in ascending order.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scale:** The system must handle a large volume of log entries (millions) and a significant number of queries.
*   **Efficiency:** Queries must be answered as quickly as possible.  Optimize for query response time.
*   **Memory:**  Minimize memory usage.  Storing all log entries in memory is not feasible.
*   **Real-time:**  The system should be able to process log entries and answer queries with minimal delay.
*   **Immutability:** Log entries cannot be modified after they are received.
*   **Machine IDs:** Assume a large number of unique `machine_id` values.
*   **Time Range:** Queries might specify very large or very small time ranges.
*   **Data Structure Choice:** Choosing appropriate data structures for efficient indexing and searching is critical.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  Implement a class called `LogAnalysisSystem`.
2.  The `LogAnalysisSystem` class should have the following methods:
    *   `__init__()`: Initializes the system.
    *   `process_log_entry(timestamp, machine_id, log_level, message)`:  Processes a new log entry.  This method should efficiently store the log entry for future queries.
    *   `query_logs(start_time, end_time, machine_ids)`:  Executes a query and returns the list of matching log entries, sorted by timestamp.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a combination of data structures to optimize for both insertion and query performance.  Think about how to index the logs for efficient retrieval by timestamp and machine ID.
*   Explore the use of in-memory data structures with careful consideration of memory footprint.
*   Consider how the choice of data structures impacts the time complexity of `process_log_entry` and `query_logs`.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithms to achieve optimal performance under the given constraints. There isn't one single "correct" solution; the best approach will involve trade-offs between memory usage, insertion time, and query time. A good solution will need to demonstrate an understanding of these trade-offs and justify the choices made. Good luck!

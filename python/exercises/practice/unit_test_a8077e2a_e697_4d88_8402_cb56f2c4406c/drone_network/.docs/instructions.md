Okay, here's a challenging problem description for a high-level programming competition, focusing on Python and aiming for a LeetCode Hard difficulty level.

**Problem:  Optimal Drone Delivery Network Design**

**Description:**

A major e-commerce company is planning to deploy a network of drone delivery hubs across a densely populated urban area.  The area is represented as a grid of interconnected locations, where each location is a potential site for a delivery hub. Each location has a demand value represent the quantity of delivery order that the location needed to be delivered.

The company wants to design a network that minimizes the overall cost of operation. The cost is determined by two factors: the cost of establishing the delivery hubs and the cost of drone delivery.

*   **Hub Establishment Cost:** Each location has an associated cost for establishing a drone delivery hub. This cost varies depending on the location's infrastructure readiness and land value.

*   **Drone Delivery Cost:** The cost of drone delivery between any two locations is proportional to the Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in grid coordinates) between them and the quantity of delivery orders. Each drone can carry one unit of delivery order. All delivery orders must be fulfilled by the closest drone delivery hub.

**Task:**

Write a Python program to determine the optimal locations for drone delivery hubs that minimize the total cost. The total cost is the sum of the hub establishment costs and the total drone delivery costs.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following:

1.  `grid_size`: An integer representing the size of the grid (e.g., 10 means a 10x10 grid). Locations are represented by coordinates (x, y), where 0 <= x < grid_size and 0 <= y < grid_size.

2.  `location_data`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a location and its associated data: `(x, y, hub_cost, demand)`.
    *   `x`, `y`: Integers representing the coordinates of the location.
    *   `hub_cost`: An integer representing the cost of establishing a hub at this location.
    *   `demand`: An integer representing the demand order quantity at this location.

3.  `max_hubs`: An integer representing the maximum number of drone delivery hubs that can be established.

**Output:**

A tuple containing:

1.  `hub_locations`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates (x, y) of a selected hub location.

2.  `total_cost`: An integer representing the minimum total cost achieved by the chosen hub locations.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= grid_size <= 50`
*   `1 <= len(location_data) <= grid_size * grid_size`
*   `0 <= x < grid_size` for each location in `location_data`
*   `0 <= y < grid_size` for each location in `location_data`
*   `0 <= hub_cost <= 1000` for each location in `location_data`
*   `0 <= demand <= 100` for each location in `location_data`
*   `1 <= max_hubs <= min(10, len(location_data))`

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must find a set of hub locations that minimizes the total cost.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   Consider using efficient algorithms and data structures to reduce the computational complexity.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Consider the case where `max_hubs` is equal to 1.
*   Consider the case where all locations have zero demand.
*   Consider cases where some locations have very high hub costs.

**Example:**

```python
grid_size = 4
location_data = [
    (0, 0, 10, 5),  # x, y, hub_cost, demand
    (0, 1, 12, 3),
    (1, 0, 15, 2),
    (1, 1, 8, 7),
    (2, 2, 11, 4),
    (2, 3, 9, 6),
    (3, 2, 13, 1),
    (3, 3, 7, 8)
]
max_hubs = 2

# Expected output (may vary depending on optimal solution):
# ([ (1, 1), (3, 3)], 114)  //The total cost may change based on your implementation details

```

**Notes:**

*   This problem requires careful consideration of the trade-off between hub establishment costs and delivery costs.
*   Dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or approximation algorithms may be useful approaches.
*   The Manhattan distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
*   All demands must be fulfilled. A location's demand is fulfilled by the closest hub.

This problem combines optimization, graph-like concepts (grid), and real-world constraints, making it a challenging and interesting problem for a programming competition. It encourages candidates to think strategically about algorithm design and efficiency. Good luck!

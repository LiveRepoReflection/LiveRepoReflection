## Problem: Decentralized Order Book Reconciliation

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for reconciling order books across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) built on a blockchain. Due to the inherent nature of decentralized systems, network latency, and varying transaction processing speeds, order books across these DEXs are often inconsistent and asynchronous.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a scenario where several DEXs exist, each maintaining its own order book for the same asset pair (e.g., ETH/USDT). Traders can place orders on any of these DEXs. Your goal is to build a system that efficiently identifies and reports discrepancies in these order books, providing valuable insights for arbitrageurs and market makers.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Data Input:** You will receive a continuous stream of order book snapshots from `N` different DEXs. Each snapshot contains a list of buy orders (bids) and sell orders (asks), sorted by price. Each order is represented by a price and a quantity.

2.  **Data Representation:** You must choose an appropriate data structure to represent the order books and the incoming snapshots. Consider the efficiency of insertion, deletion, and search operations when selecting your data structure.

3.  **Reconciliation Logic:** Your system should identify and report the following types of discrepancies:

    *   **Price Discrepancies:** Instances where the best bid or ask price for a given asset pair differs significantly across DEXs (beyond a configurable threshold).
    *   **Quantity Discrepancies:** Instances where the total quantity available at a specific price level differs significantly across DEXs.
    *   **Stale Orders:** Orders that appear in some DEXs but are missing or have been filled in others.

4.  **Efficiency:** The system must be highly efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Processing incoming snapshots and identifying discrepancies should be performed in a timely manner, minimizing latency. Memory usage should also be carefully managed, especially when dealing with a large number of DEXs and a high volume of orders.

5.  **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale to handle a large number of DEXs and a high volume of orders. Consider using techniques such as data partitioning, caching, and distributed processing to improve scalability.

6.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be robust and fault-tolerant. It should be able to handle temporary network outages, DEX downtime, and other unexpected events without losing data or compromising accuracy.

7.  **Output:** The system should generate a report that summarizes the identified discrepancies, including the DEXs involved, the asset pair, the price and quantity differences, and the timestamps of the snapshots.  The report should be structured in a way that allows for easy analysis and interpretation.  The format of the report is not strictly defined and can be chosen based on your design.

**Constraints:**

*   `N` (Number of DEXs): 1 <= N <= 100
*   Number of orders per DEX snapshot: 1 <= orders <= 1000
*   Price precision: Up to 8 decimal places.
*   Quantity precision: Up to 8 decimal places.
*   The system must operate in near real-time.
*   Assume DEX snapshots are not perfectly synchronized (timestamps will vary).

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism to automatically adjust discrepancy thresholds based on market volatility.
*   Incorporate transaction cost estimates (gas fees) into the discrepancy analysis to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities.
*   Design a user interface to visualize the order books and the identified discrepancies.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The system must accurately identify and report discrepancies in the order books.
*   Efficiency: The system must be highly efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
*   Scalability: The system must be designed to scale to handle a large number of DEXs and a high volume of orders.
*   Fault Tolerance: The system must be robust and fault-tolerant.
*   Code Quality: The code must be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   Design: The system design must be well-reasoned and justified.

This problem requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, distributed systems, and blockchain technology.  Good luck!

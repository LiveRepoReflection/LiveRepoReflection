## The Quantum Maze Router

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a highly efficient maze router for a quantum computer. The router must connect an arbitrary number of quantum processing units (qubits) located on a 2D grid.  Due to the delicate nature of quantum information, minimizing the length of the connections and avoiding intersections is paramount.

The 2D grid is represented by a matrix where '0' indicates an open cell and '1' indicates an obstacle. Each qubit is represented by its (row, column) coordinates on the grid.

**Goal:**

Given a grid and a list of qubit coordinates, find a set of paths that connect all qubits. The paths must adhere to the following constraints, ranked by importance:

1.  **Connectivity:** All qubits must be connected, directly or indirectly, through the paths. In other words, all qubits must belong to the same connected component in the graph formed by the paths.

2.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** Paths must not pass through cells marked as '1' (obstacles).

3.  **Minimum Total Wirelength:** Minimize the sum of the lengths of all paths (number of cells traversed).  Manhattan distance is used to calculate wirelength.

4.  **Minimum Path Intersections:** Minimize the number of times paths intersect each other.  An intersection occurs when two or more paths share the same cell.  A cell where a path *terminates* at a qubit is *not* considered an intersection.

5.  **Path Uniqueness:** For any two qubits, there exists at most one path between them.

**Input:**

*   `grid`: A 2D list of integers representing the grid.
*   `qubits`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the (row, column) coordinates of a qubit.

**Output:**

A list of paths, where each path is a list of tuples representing the (row, column) coordinates of the cells forming the path.  If it is impossible to connect all qubits, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   The grid can be large (up to 500x500).
*   The number of qubits can be significant (up to 50).
*   The grid may contain many obstacles.
*   Solutions must be efficient in terms of both time and memory.  Brute-force approaches will not be feasible.
*   Multiple valid solutions may exist.  The goal is to find a solution that balances all constraints, with connectivity and obstacle avoidance being the most critical.
*   The grid is guaranteed to be surrounded by obstacles (all perimeter cells are '1').
*   No two qubits will occupy the same cell.
*   Qubits will never be located on obstacle cells.

**Example:**

```python
grid = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]
qubits = [(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)]

# A possible output (order of paths doesn't matter):
# [
#     [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)],
#     [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
# ]
```

**Judging Criteria:**

Solutions will be judged based on:

1.  **Correctness:** Does the solution correctly connect all qubits while avoiding obstacles?
2.  **Total Wirelength:** How short are the connections?
3.  **Path Intersections:** How few intersections are present?
4.  **Efficiency:** How quickly does the algorithm run and how much memory does it consume?

Good luck connecting those qubits!

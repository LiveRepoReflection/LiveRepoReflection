## Quantum Circuit Optimization

**Question Description:**

You are working on a quantum computing project and need to optimize a large quantum circuit for execution on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device. The circuit is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent quantum gates and edges represent qubit dependencies. Each gate has a specific execution time and error rate associated with it.

The quantum device has limited connectivity, meaning that not all qubits can directly interact with each other. To perform a two-qubit gate between qubits that are not physically connected, you need to insert SWAP gates to move the qubit states until they are adjacent. Each SWAP gate also has an execution time and error rate.

Your task is to implement an algorithm that optimizes the quantum circuit by minimizing the overall execution time while staying within a given maximum acceptable error rate.

**Input:**

*   `circuit`: A dictionary representing the quantum circuit DAG. Keys are gate IDs (integers), and values are dictionaries containing the following information:
    *   `'type'`: The type of the gate (string, e.g., 'H', 'CNOT', 'SWAP').
    *   `'qubits'`: A list of qubit IDs (integers) that the gate operates on.
    *   `'time'`: The execution time of the gate (float).
    *   `'error'`: The error rate of the gate (float, between 0 and 1).
*   `connectivity`: A list of tuples representing the physical connectivity of the qubits on the device. Each tuple `(q1, q2)` indicates that qubits `q1` and `q2` are directly connected.
*   `swap_time`: The execution time of a SWAP gate (float).
*   `swap_error`: The error rate of a SWAP gate (float, between 0 and 1).
*   `max_error`: The maximum acceptable error rate for the entire circuit (float, between 0 and 1).
*   `initial_mapping`: A dictionary representing the initial mapping of virtual qubits (used in the circuit) to physical qubits on the device. Keys are virtual qubit IDs (integers) and values are physical qubit IDs (integers).

**Output:**

*   A modified `circuit` dictionary representing the optimized quantum circuit. The optimized circuit should include inserted SWAP gates to satisfy qubit connectivity constraints. The overall execution time should be minimized while ensuring that the total error rate of the circuit (including the inserted SWAP gates) does not exceed `max_error`.
*   The keys from the original circuit should remain the same and their information should be updated as necessary. New gates should be added with new integer keys not present in the original circuit. These new gates should hold the gate information described above.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of qubits in the circuit is limited.
*   The depth of the circuit (longest path in the DAG) can be significant.
*   The connectivity of the quantum device is sparse.
*   The execution time and error rate of each gate are fixed.
*   You cannot change the order of the gates in the original circuit (i.e., you must respect the DAG structure).
*   You can only insert SWAP gates to move qubit states.
*   The total error rate is calculated as the sum of the error rates of all gates in the circuit.  This is a simplification for the problem, but it adds to the difficulty.
*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle circuits with a moderate number of gates and qubits.
*   The algorithm must find a solution within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1 minute).
*   If no solution can be found that satisfies the error constraint, return `None`.

**Optimization Goal:**

Minimize the total execution time of the optimized quantum circuit while adhering to the error rate constraint.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** The optimized circuit must produce the correct result (i.e., implement the same quantum algorithm as the original circuit).
2.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle circuits of moderate size within the time limit.
3.  **Error Rate:** The total error rate of the optimized circuit must not exceed the specified `max_error`.
4.  **Execution Time:** The total execution time of the optimized circuit should be minimized.
5.  **Adherence to Constraints:** The solution must adhere to all the constraints specified above.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and knowledge of quantum computing concepts. Good luck!

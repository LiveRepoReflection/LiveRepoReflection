Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to test a range of skills, including algorithm design, data structure selection, and optimization.

**Problem Title:** Optimal Network Partitioning for Resilient Communication

**Problem Description:**

You are given a representation of a communication network as an undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents a network device, and each edge represents a direct communication link between two devices. The network is considered *vulnerable* if removing any single device (and its associated links) disconnects the network into two or more disjoint components. Such a device is called an *articulation point*.

Your task is to partition the network into a specified number of *resilient clusters*. A resilient cluster is defined as a subgraph where the removal of any single node *does not* disconnect the subgraph. In other words, a resilient cluster should *not* contain any articulation points within itself.

**Input:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of devices in the network (1 <= n <= 1000).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an undirected edge between device `u` and device `v`. Devices are numbered from 0 to `n-1`.
*   `k`: An integer representing the desired number of resilient clusters (1 <= k <= n).
*   `node_weights`: A list of integers representing the weight of each node. The weight represents the cost of placing the device in a cluster (1 <= weight <= 1000).

**Output:**

Return the minimum total cost to partition the network into `k` resilient clusters. If it is not possible to partition the network into `k` resilient clusters, return -1.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Resilience:** Each cluster must be resilient (i.e., not contain any articulation points).
*   **Connectivity:** You do *not* need to ensure that the clusters themselves are connected in the original graph. It is acceptable for a single cluster to consist of multiple disconnected components in the *original* graph, as long as that cluster itself is resilient.
*   **Completeness:** Every device must belong to exactly one cluster.
*   **Optimization:** The primary goal is to minimize the total cost of the partitioning, which is the sum of the weights of all nodes assigned to each cluster.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must be efficient enough to handle networks with up to 1000 devices within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).
*   **Articulation Point Detection:** You'll need an efficient algorithm (e.g., Tarjan's algorithm) to identify articulation points in the network.
*   **Dynamic Programming (Recommended):** A dynamic programming approach is likely required to explore the possible partitioning strategies and find the optimal solution.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Disconnected graphs.
*   Graphs with no articulation points.
*   Graphs where `k` is equal to `n` (each device is its own cluster).
*   Graphs where `k` is equal to 1 (the entire network is a single cluster - check if it's resilient).
*   Scenarios where no valid partition can be found.
*   Small networks (e.g., n = 1, 2, 3) to verify base cases.

**Example:**

```python
n = 6
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3)]
k = 2
node_weights = [10, 12, 15, 8, 5, 7]

# Expected Output: 40 (One possible optimal partition: {0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5} -> 10 + 12 + 15 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 57, but after removing articulation point 2 and 3, {0, 1}, {}, {} are the result.)
# Cluster 1: {0, 1, 2}.  Nodes 0, 1, and 2 form a resilient cluster. Cost: 10 + 12 + 15 = 37
# Cluster 2: {3, 4, 5}. Nodes 3, 4, and 5 form a resilient cluster. Cost: 8 + 5 + 7 = 20
# Total Cost: 37+20 = 57.  This needs to be optimized.

#One Optimal solution is: Cluster 1: {0, 1}, cluster 2: {2, 3, 4, 5}, total cost: 10+12+15+8+5+7 = 57

```

**This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and careful consideration of edge cases.  Good luck!**

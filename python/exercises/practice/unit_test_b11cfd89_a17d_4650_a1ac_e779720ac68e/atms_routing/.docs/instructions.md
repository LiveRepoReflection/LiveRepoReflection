## Project Name

**Autonomous Traffic Management System (ATMS)**

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a core component of an Autonomous Traffic Management System (ATMS) for a smart city. This component is responsible for optimizing traffic flow within a defined region, aiming to minimize average travel time and prevent congestion.

The region is represented as a directed graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent intersections. Each intersection has a unique ID (an integer).
*   **Edges:** Represent road segments connecting intersections. Each road segment has:
    *   A `length` (in meters).
    *   A `speed_limit` (in km/h).
    *   A `capacity` (maximum number of vehicles that can be present on the road segment).
    *   A `current_traffic` (the number of vehicles currently on the road segment).
    *   A `delay_function` (calculates the delay introduced by each vehicle on the road, given the `current_traffic`). The delay is in seconds.

Your system receives a constant stream of travel requests. Each request specifies:

*   A `start_intersection_id`.
*   An `end_intersection_id`.
*   A `departure_time` (in seconds from the start of the simulation).

Your task is to implement a function that, given the current state of the road network (graph) and a new travel request, calculates the **fastest route** (minimum travel time) from the start intersection to the end intersection, considering the `delay_function` of each road segment.

**Important Considerations:**

1.  **Dynamic Traffic:** The `current_traffic` on each road segment changes over time as vehicles enter and leave. Assume that after you calculate the fastest route for a request, the ATMS will handle updating the `current_traffic` on the segments of the chosen route. Your route calculation should consider the *current* traffic, not predicted future traffic.
2.  **Delay Function:** The delay introduced by a single vehicle on a road segment is calculated by the `delay_function`. The total delay on a road segment is the delay introduced by each vehicle currently on that road. The travel time for a vehicle on a road segment is calculated as:
    `travel_time = (length / (speed_limit * 1000/3600)) + (current_traffic * delay_function(current_traffic))`
    *Length in meters, Speed limit in KM/H, Travel Time in seconds.*
3.  **Real-time Performance:** Your algorithm must be efficient enough to handle a large number of requests in real-time.  A naive implementation (e.g., repeatedly recomputing the entire shortest-path tree for every request) will likely time out.
4.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no route exists between the start and end intersections.
5.  **Negative Delay:** The delay function can sometimes cause negative delay. Your algorithm must be able to handle negative delay, but can assume that there is no negative cycle.
6.  **Optimization:** The graph can be quite large (thousands of nodes and edges). Optimize your algorithm for speed and memory usage. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithmic techniques to achieve optimal performance.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the road network.  Keys are intersection IDs (integers). Values are dictionaries with the following structure:

    ```python
    {
        'neighbors': {
            neighbor_id: { # Integer
                'length': float,       # in meters
                'speed_limit': float,  # in km/h
                'capacity': int,
                'current_traffic': int,
                'delay_function': Callable[[int], float] # function takes current_traffic as input, return delay in seconds
            }
        }
    }
    ```

*   `start_intersection_id`: An integer representing the ID of the starting intersection.
*   `end_intersection_id`: An integer representing the ID of the destination intersection.
*   `departure_time`: A float representing the departure time of the request (in seconds from the simulation start).

**Output:**

*   A list of intersection IDs representing the fastest route from the `start_intersection_id` to the `end_intersection_id`.  If no route exists, return an empty list.  The list should start with the `start_intersection_id` and end with the `end_intersection_id`.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph will be a valid directed graph (no self-loops, parallel edges allowed).
*   Intersection IDs will be non-negative integers.
*   `length`, `speed_limit`, `capacity`, and `current_traffic` will be non-negative numbers.
*   The `delay_function` will always return a number (positive, negative, or zero).
*   The graph may contain disconnected components.
*   The number of intersections in the graph can be up to 10,000.
*   The number of road segments can be up to 100,000.
*   The simulation time is continuous and represented by floating-point numbers.
*   Your solution must complete within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 seconds) for each request.
*   There exists no negative cycle in the graph.

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

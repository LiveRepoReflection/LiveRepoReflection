Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to be "LeetCode Hard" level, focusing on optimization and real-world relevance.

**Problem Title: Scalable Event Stream Aggregation**

**Problem Description:**

You are building a real-time analytics platform that processes a massive stream of events. Each event consists of a timestamp (in milliseconds since the epoch), a user ID (a string), and a numerical value (a float). Your task is to implement a system that efficiently aggregates these events to provide real-time insights into user activity.

Specifically, you need to implement a data structure and associated functions that can:

1.  **Ingest Events:**  Accept a stream of events in the format `(timestamp, user_id, value)`. Events arrive in arbitrary order (not necessarily sorted by timestamp or user ID).

2.  **Aggregate Values:** For a given user ID and a time window (start timestamp, end timestamp), calculate the sum of all values for that user within that time window (inclusive).

3.  **Handle High Throughput:** The system must be able to handle a very high rate of incoming events (millions per second).  Ingestion and aggregation queries should be optimized for speed.

4.  **Memory Constraints:** The system's memory usage should be bounded. You cannot store all events indefinitely.  Implement a strategy to manage memory usage while still providing accurate results for recent time windows.

5.  **Graceful Degradation:** If the system reaches its memory limit, it should not crash. Instead, it should implement a mechanism to discard the oldest data (e.g., a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy or similar) and continue processing new events, while potentially returning approximate results for older time windows.

6.  **Concurrency:** The system must be thread-safe and designed to handle concurrent ingestion and aggregation requests from multiple users.

**Input:**

*   A stream of events represented as tuples: `(timestamp, user_id, value)`.
*   Aggregation queries represented as tuples: `(user_id, start_timestamp, end_timestamp)`.

**Output:**

*   For each aggregation query, return the sum of values for the specified user within the specified time window. If the data for the time window is unavailable due to memory constraints, return an approximate sum, if possible, or indicate that the data is unavailable (e.g., return `None` or a special error value).

**Constraints:**

*   Timestamps are in milliseconds since the epoch (positive integers).
*   User IDs are arbitrary strings.
*   Values are floats.
*   The number of unique user IDs can be very large (millions or billions).
*   Memory usage must be limited (e.g., to a few gigabytes).
*   The system must be thread-safe.
*   Latency for aggregation queries should be as low as possible.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement different aggregation functions (e.g., average, min, max, standard deviation).
*   Support querying for the top K users with the highest aggregated values within a time window.
*   Implement persistence to disk for data recovery in case of system failure.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  The aggregation results should be accurate for time windows where data is available.
*   Performance:  The system should handle a high rate of incoming events and aggregation queries with low latency.
*   Memory Usage: The system should efficiently manage memory usage and avoid exceeding the specified limit.
*   Robustness: The system should handle edge cases, invalid input, and concurrency gracefully.
*   Design: The code should be well-structured, modular, and easy to understand.

Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem for a high-level programming competition:

**Problem Title:**  Optimal Network Partitioning for Resilient Communication

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a resilient communication network for a critical infrastructure system.  The network consists of `N` nodes, each representing a server or a device. These nodes are interconnected by bidirectional communication links. Each link has a latency associated with it, representing the time it takes for a message to travel between the connected nodes.

Due to potential adversarial attacks or unexpected failures, the network may need to be partitioned into multiple disjoint sub-networks.  Each sub-network must remain functional and capable of internal communication. The goal is to determine the *minimum number of links that must be removed* to achieve a network partition such that the maximum diameter (longest shortest path between any two nodes) of any sub-network does not exceed a given threshold `D`.  Diameter is measured by the *sum of latencies* of edges on the path.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   `D`: The maximum allowed diameter of any sub-network (1 <= D <= 10000).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, latency)` represents a bidirectional communication link between node `u` and node `v` with a latency of `latency`. Nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.  (0 <= u, v < N, 1 <= latency <= 100).  There will be at most N*(N-1)/2 edges. The graph is guaranteed to be connected before any edges are removed.

**Output:**

*   The minimum number of links that must be removed to achieve a network partition where the maximum diameter of each resulting sub-network is at most `D`. If it is impossible to partition the network to meet the diameter constraint, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large networks (up to 1000 nodes). Consider the time complexity of your algorithm. Inefficient solutions will likely time out.
*   **Connected Components:** After removing the minimum number of links, each remaining connected component must have a diameter no greater than `D`.  A single isolated node is considered a connected component with a diameter of 0.
*   **Optimization:** Removing links is costly. Therefore, you must find the *absolute minimum* number of links to remove. Removing more links than necessary will result in a wrong answer.
*   **Disconnected Graph:** After removing links, the resulting graph might be disconnected.  The diameter constraint applies to each connected component.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases carefully, such as:
    *   Empty graph (no nodes or edges).
    *   A single node.
    *   A fully connected graph where every node is connected to every other node.
    *   A graph where it's impossible to partition the network to meet the diameter constraint.
*   **Multiple Solutions:** If multiple solutions exist with the same minimum number of removed edges, any of them is acceptable. You only need to return the *number* of removed edges.
*   **Practical Relevance:** This problem models a real-world scenario in critical infrastructure where maintaining communication within bounded latency is crucial even under adverse conditions.

This problem combines graph algorithms (shortest paths, connected components), optimization, and careful handling of constraints and edge cases. A brute-force approach will not be feasible for larger networks, necessitating a more sophisticated algorithmic solution.

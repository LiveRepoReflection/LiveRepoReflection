### Question Description

**Problem:** Imagine you are designing the core infrastructure for a large-scale Content Delivery Network (CDN). The CDN needs to efficiently route user requests to the optimal server based on several factors: server load, network latency, and content availability.

You are given a network represented as a directed graph.  Each node in the graph represents a server location. Edges represent network connections between locations.

Each edge `(u, v)` has the following properties:

*   `capacity`: The maximum bandwidth that can be transmitted from server `u` to server `v`. This represents the physical limitations of the network connection.
*   `latency`: The time it takes for a packet to travel from server `u` to server `v`.

You are also given a list of user requests. Each request has the following properties:

*   `content_id`:  A unique identifier for the content being requested.
*   `source_location`: The server location where the request originates.
*   `destination_location`: The server location where the requested content should be served.
*   `size`: The amount of data (in MB) that needs to be transferred.

Finally, each server location `u` has the following properties:

*   `load`: The current processing load of the server.
*   `content_availability`: A dictionary mapping `content_id` to a boolean value indicating whether the server has the content available locally.

**Task:**

Write a function `optimize_network_flow(graph, requests)` that takes the network graph and a list of user requests as input. The function should return a list of routing paths for each request, minimizing the total latency while respecting the bandwidth constraints and server load.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Bandwidth Constraint:** The flow on each edge must not exceed its `capacity`.
2.  **Server Load Constraint:**  The total data served by each server must not exceed a server-specific maximum load threshold. You can assume that each server has a `max_load` property that defines this threshold. Serving data increases server load, thus this needs to be accounted for.
3.  **Content Availability Constraint:** Requests must be routed to servers that have the requested `content_id` available locally.
4.  **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the total latency across all requests. Total latency is the sum of the latency of each edge used in routing a request, multiplied by the size of the request.

**Input Format:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph. Keys are server locations (strings). Values are dictionaries representing outgoing edges. Each outgoing edge dictionary has the destination server location as the key, and a dictionary of edge properties (`capacity`, `latency`) as the value. Example:

    ```python
    graph = {
        "A": {"B": {"capacity": 10, "latency": 5}, "C": {"capacity": 15, "latency": 10}},
        "B": {"D": {"capacity": 20, "latency": 3}},
        "C": {"D": {"capacity": 8, "latency": 7}},
        "D": {}
    }
    ```

*   `requests`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a user request. Example:

    ```python
    requests = [
        {"content_id": "video1", "source_location": "A", "destination_location": "D", "size": 5},
        {"content_id": "image2", "source_location": "B", "destination_location": "D", "size": 3}
    ]
    ```

Each server location in the graph also has load and content availability properties. These can be accessed via the `server_properties` parameter which is a dictionary where each key is a server location and the value is a dictionary containing the `load`, `max_load` and `content_availability` properties.

```python
server_properties = {
    "A": {"load": 0, "max_load": 20, "content_availability": {"video1": False, "image2": True}},
    "B": {"load": 0, "max_load": 15, "content_availability": {"video1": True, "image2": False}},
    "C": {"load": 0, "max_load": 10, "content_availability": {"video1": True, "image2": True}},
    "D": {"load": 0, "max_load": 25, "content_availability": {"video1": True, "image2": True}}
}

```

**Output Format:**

A list of lists. Each inner list represents the routing path for a request, and contains the server locations in the order they are traversed. If no path is possible due to constraints, the path should be an empty list `[]`.

Example:

```python
[
    ["A", "B", "D"],  # Routing path for the first request
    ["B", "D"]       # Routing path for the second request
]
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must find valid paths that satisfy all constraints.
*   **Optimization:** The solution should prioritize paths with lower total latency.
*   **Efficiency:**  The solution should be efficient enough to handle reasonably sized networks and request loads (e.g., graphs with up to 100 nodes and 1000 requests).
*   **Edge Cases:** The solution needs to handle cases where no path exists, where the content is not available anywhere, where the network is disconnected, or where there are conflicting requests that cannot be fulfilled simultaneously.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search to find the shortest path, taking into account latency and bandwidth constraints.
*   You may need to use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum flow in the network.
*   Think about how to represent server load and content availability in your graph representation.
*   Consider using dynamic programming to optimize the overall routing strategy.

This problem combines graph algorithms, network flow concepts, and optimization techniques, making it a challenging and rewarding exercise for advanced programmers. Good luck!

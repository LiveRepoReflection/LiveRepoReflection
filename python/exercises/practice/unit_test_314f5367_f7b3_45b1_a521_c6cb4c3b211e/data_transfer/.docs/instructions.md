Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a programmer's skills in graph algorithms, optimization, and handling real-world constraints.

**Problem Title: Optimal Multi-Hop Data Transfer**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a data transfer system for a distributed network. The network consists of `N` nodes, each with a unique ID from `0` to `N-1`. Data needs to be transferred from a source node `S` to a destination node `D`. However, direct connections between all nodes are not available. Instead, the network has a set of pre-defined "transfer routes."

Each transfer route is defined by a tuple `(u, v, c, t)`, where:

*   `u` is the source node of the route.
*   `v` is the destination node of the route.
*   `c` is the cost associated with using this route.  This represents a fee or resource consumption.
*   `t` is the transfer time (in seconds) associated with using this route.

You are given a list of these transfer routes. A data transfer can involve multiple hops (using several routes sequentially). The goal is to find the optimal data transfer path from node `S` to node `D` that minimizes a combined metric:

`Minimize: Total Cost + (α * Total Transfer Time)`

Where `α` is a given weighting factor that determines the relative importance of transfer time compared to cost.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Network Size:** `1 <= N <= 1000`
2.  **Number of Routes:** `1 <= M <= 5000` (where M is the number of transfer routes)
3.  **Cost Range:** `1 <= c <= 100` for each route.
4.  **Time Range:** `1 <= t <= 100` for each route.
5.  **Weighting Factor:** `0 <= α <= 10`
6.  **Source and Destination:** `0 <= S, D < N` and `S != D`.
7.  **Disconnected Graph:** It is possible that there is no path from S to D. In this case, return `-1`.
8.  **Optimization:** The algorithm must efficiently handle the given constraints.  A naive brute-force approach will likely time out. Consider using efficient graph algorithms and data structures.  Think about Dijkstra's or A* with appropriate modifications.
9.  **Tie-breaking:** If multiple paths result in the same minimum value of `Total Cost + (α * Total Transfer Time)`, return the path with the *shortest* transfer time.
10. **No negative cycles:** The graph will not contain any negative cycles.
11. **Return Value:**  Return the minimum value of `Total Cost + (α * Total Transfer Time)` for the optimal path from S to D. If no path exists, return -1. Round the result to two decimal places.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `routes`: A list of tuples representing the transfer routes: `[(u1, v1, c1, t1), (u2, v2, c2, t2), ...]`.
*   `S`: The source node.
*   `D`: The destination node.
*   `α`: The weighting factor.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
routes = [(0, 1, 5, 2), (0, 2, 3, 4), (1, 3, 6, 1), (2, 3, 2, 3), (3, 4, 4, 5)]
S = 0
D = 4
α = 1.0

Optimal path: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
Total Cost = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9
Total Time = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12
Result = 9 + (1.0 * 12) = 21.00
```

This problem requires a good understanding of graph traversal, pathfinding algorithms, and optimization techniques. It also requires careful handling of edge cases and constraints. Good luck!

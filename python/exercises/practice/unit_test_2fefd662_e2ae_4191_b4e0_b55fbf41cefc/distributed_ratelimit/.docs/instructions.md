Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and incorporate the elements you specified.

**Problem Title:**  Scalable Distributed Rate Limiter

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable, distributed rate limiter. This rate limiter will be used to protect a critical API from abuse and ensure fair usage across many clients.

The rate limiter must:

1.  **Enforce Rate Limits:**  Each client (identified by a unique client ID) should be limited to a configurable number of requests within a specified time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour).  Different clients may have different rate limits.

2.  **Distributed Operation:**  The rate limiter must be able to handle a high volume of requests distributed across multiple servers.  This means it cannot rely on a single, centralized counter.

3.  **Near Real-Time Accuracy:**  The rate limits should be enforced as accurately as possible.  While perfect accuracy is difficult in a distributed system, significant deviations from the configured limits are unacceptable.

4.  **Scalability:**  The system should be able to handle a growing number of clients and requests without significant performance degradation.  Adding more rate limiter instances should increase capacity.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:**  The system should be resilient to failures. The failure of one or more rate limiter instances should not cause the entire system to fail, and rate limiting should continue to function (perhaps with slightly reduced accuracy).

6.  **Configurability:**  The rate limits for each client should be easily configurable and updateable without restarting the rate limiter service. This includes adding new clients, removing clients, and modifying existing limits.

7.  **Efficiency:** Each rate limit request should be processed with minimal latency and resource consumption.

**Input:**

The rate limiter receives requests in the following format:

```json
{
  "client_id": "unique_client_identifier",
  "request_timestamp": 1678886400  // Unix timestamp
}
```

**Output:**

For each request, the rate limiter should return:

```json
{
  "allowed": true/false,
  "remaining_requests": integer, // number of requests remaining in the current window.
  "retry_after": integer (optional) // Number of seconds to wait before retrying (only if allowed is false).
}
```

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The number of clients can be very large (millions).
*   The request rate can be extremely high (thousands or tens of thousands of requests per second).
*   Rate limits can vary significantly between clients.
*   The time window for rate limits can range from seconds to days.
*   Consider the impact of clock skew in a distributed environment.
*   Clients might attempt to circumvent the rate limiter (e.g., by using multiple IP addresses).  While you don't need to solve this completely, consider how your design might mitigate such attempts.
*   The rate limit config should be reloaded without service interruption.

**Considerations:**

*   You are free to use any appropriate data structures and algorithms.
*   You can assume the availability of common infrastructure components (e.g., a distributed cache, a message queue, a database). Specify which ones you use and why.
*   Trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and resource consumption should be carefully considered and documented.
*   Consider the challenges of maintaining consistent state across multiple rate limiter instances.
*   Discuss potential strategies for handling "bursts" of traffic (e.g., using a token bucket algorithm).
*   Describe how you would monitor and alert on the performance and health of the rate limiter service.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems design, data structures, algorithms, and performance optimization.  It also tests the ability to reason about trade-offs and make informed decisions in a complex environment. Good luck!

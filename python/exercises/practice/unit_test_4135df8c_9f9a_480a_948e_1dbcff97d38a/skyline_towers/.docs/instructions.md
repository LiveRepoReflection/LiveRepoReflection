## The Skyline Optimization Problem

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the placement of cellular towers in a city to provide optimal coverage while minimizing costs. The city is represented as a 2D grid, where each cell represents a city block. The height of each block is given in a matrix `city_blocks`.

`city_blocks[i][j]` represents the height of the building at block `(i, j)`.

You need to place `k` cellular towers in this city. Each tower has a coverage radius `r`. A block `(i, j)` is covered by a tower at `(x, y)` if the Manhattan distance between them is less than or equal to `r`: `|i - x| + |j - y| <= r`. A tower can be placed on any block in the city.

The *coverage score* is defined as the number of blocks covered by at least one tower.

The *cost* of placing a tower at `(x, y)` is `cost[x][y]` where `cost` is a matrix of the same dimensions as `city_blocks`.

Your goal is to find the optimal placement of the `k` towers such that the *coverage score* is maximized while minimizing the *total cost* of the towers. To balance these two objectives, you will calculate a combined *objective function* using a coverage weight `coverage_weight` and a cost weight `cost_weight`.

**Objective Function:**

Maximize: `(coverage_weight * coverage_score) - (cost_weight * total_cost)`

**Input:**

*   `city_blocks`: A 2D list of integers representing the height of buildings in each city block.
*   `cost`: A 2D list of integers representing the cost of placing a tower in each city block.
*   `k`: An integer representing the number of towers to place.
*   `r`: An integer representing the coverage radius of each tower.
*   `coverage_weight`: A float representing the weight of the coverage score in the objective function.
*   `cost_weight`: A float representing the weight of the total cost in the objective function.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= Number of rows, columns in `city_blocks` and `cost` <= 100
*   0 <= `city_blocks[i][j]` <= 100
*   0 <= `cost[i][j]` <= 1000
*   1 <= `k` <= 10
*   1 <= `r` <= min(Number of rows, Number of columns)
*   0 <= `coverage_weight`, `cost_weight` <= 1.0
*   `coverage_weight + cost_weight = 1.0`

**Output:**

Return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates `(x, y)` of a tower placed in the city.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Due to the size of the grid, a brute-force solution that checks every possible tower placement will likely time out. Your solution should be optimized to handle the given constraints efficiently, ideally with a time complexity significantly better than O(n<sup>2k</sup>) where n is the size of the grid.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Consider the case where `k` is larger than the number of blocks in the city.
*   Consider the case where `r` is large enough to cover the entire city with fewer than `k` towers.
*   Consider the case where `coverage_weight` or `cost_weight` is zero.
*   Consider cases where different tower placements lead to the same coverage score but different costs.

**Real-World Considerations:**

This problem reflects real-world network planning challenges where coverage and cost are key factors in determining the optimal infrastructure deployment.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

There are several potential approaches to solving this problem, each with its own trade-offs:

*   **Greedy Approach:** Iteratively place towers in the location that provides the most significant increase in coverage per cost.
*   **Dynamic Programming:** Build a table of optimal solutions for placing `i` towers in a subgrid of the city.
*   **Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithms:** Use metaheuristic optimization techniques to search for a good solution.

Choose the approach you believe will provide the best balance between solution quality and runtime efficiency.

Good luck!

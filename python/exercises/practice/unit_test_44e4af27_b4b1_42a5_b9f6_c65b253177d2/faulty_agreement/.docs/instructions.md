## The Byzantine Agreement with Faulty Messengers

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a distributed system consisting of *n* generals. These generals need to agree on a single plan of action â€“ either to attack or retreat. They communicate by sending messages to each other. However, *m* of the messengers responsible for delivering these messages are faulty. Faulty messengers can do the following:

1.  **Delay messages:** Hold onto a message for an arbitrary amount of time.
2.  **Drop messages:** Discard a message completely.
3.  **Alter messages:** Modify the content of a message before delivering it (including creating forged messages).

The challenge is to design an algorithm that allows the loyal generals (those who are not faulty messengers) to reach a consensus on the plan of action, despite the presence of these malicious messengers.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The total number of generals (3 <= n <= 1000).
*   `m`: The maximum number of faulty messengers (0 <= m < n). Note that the generals themselves are trustworthy, only the messengers can be faulty.
*   `commander_decision`: A boolean value representing the commander's initial decision (True for "attack", False for "retreat").
*   `messages`: A list of tuples. Each tuple represents a message and has the form `(sender_id, receiver_id, message_content)`. `sender_id` and `receiver_id` are integers ranging from 0 to n-1 representing the general ID. `message_content` is a boolean value, representing the decision that general `sender_id` is sending to general `receiver_id`. You should assume that all the messages declared in this list are sent to all generals who are not `receiver_id`.

**Output:**

A list of boolean values, where the *i*-th element represents the final decision reached by general *i* (0-indexed). The final decisions should satisfy the following conditions:

1.  **Agreement:** All loyal generals must agree on the same decision.
2.  **Validity:** If the commander is loyal and the commander's initial decision is *v*, then all loyal generals must decide on *v*.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Efficiency:** Your algorithm should be reasonably efficient. A brute-force solution that explores all possible message manipulations will likely time out.
*   **Resilience:** The algorithm must tolerate up to *m* faulty messengers.  The algorithm should still produce a consistent output for each general.
*   **Practicality:**  The algorithm should be implementable in a real-world distributed system. This implicitly implies a finite number of rounds of communication.
*   **No Shared Memory:** The generals can only communicate by sending messages. They do not have access to shared memory or a central authority.
*   **Majority Rule:** You are encouraged to use a majority voting approach to reach a consensus.
*   **Faulty Messenger Identification is Impossible:** The generals cannot reliably identify which messengers are faulty. They must work with the assumption that any message could be corrupted.
*   **Assume Perfect Generals:** Assume the generals themselves follow the protocol correctly. The only source of errors are the faulty messengers.
*   **Byzantine Generals variant**: Note that this is not the classic Byzantine Generals problem where some generals are traitors. In this problem, the generals are trustworthy, and only the messengers are faulty.
*   **Guaranteed Solution**: Assume that a solution always exists for the given input.

**Example:**

Let's say n = 3, m = 0, commander\_decision = True.
The messages list can be empty as there are no faulty messengers.
The expected output will be: `[True, True, True]`

This problem challenges you to implement a robust and efficient solution to the Byzantine Agreement problem in a simplified setting with faulty messengers. Good luck!

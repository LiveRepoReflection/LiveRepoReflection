## Question: Distributed Transaction Ordering

**Problem Description:**

You are building a distributed database system that supports ACID transactions. To ensure consistency across multiple nodes, you need to implement a robust transaction ordering mechanism. Your system consists of `N` nodes, each with a unique identifier from `0` to `N-1`.

Each transaction involves a set of operations that must be executed atomically. The system receives transactions from clients in an arbitrary order. Each transaction is represented by a tuple `(transaction_id, participating_nodes, operations)`.

*   `transaction_id`: A unique integer identifying the transaction.
*   `participating_nodes`: A set of node identifiers (integers between 0 and N-1) that are involved in the transaction.
*   `operations`: A list of operations to be executed. For simplicity, each operation is a string.

Your task is to design an algorithm that determines a global, consistent order for executing these transactions across all nodes, adhering to the following constraints:

1.  **Causality Preservation:** If transaction `A` depends on transaction `B` (e.g., `A` reads data written by `B`), then `B` must be executed before `A` on any node that participates in both transactions. You are given a `dependencies` list, where each element `(A, B)` signifies that transaction `A` depends on transaction `B`. Note that cyclic dependencies are possible and must be handled.
2.  **Concurrency Control:** Transactions that access the same data on the same node must be serialized to avoid conflicts. You need to identify these conflicts and ensure that conflicting transactions are executed in a consistent order across all nodes. Assume that two transactions are conflicting if they share at least one common `participating_node` and the `operations` list of both transactions contains at least one same operation.
3.  **Deadlock Prevention:** The ordering algorithm should prevent deadlocks that could arise from conflicting transactions waiting for each other.
4.  **Scalability:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle a large number of nodes and transactions (up to 10<sup>5</sup> transactions and 10<sup>3</sup> nodes).
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** While you don't need to implement full fault tolerance, your algorithm should be resilient to temporary node failures. If a node is temporarily unavailable, the ordering process should not halt indefinitely. You can assume that a failed node will eventually recover.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the system.
*   `transactions`: A list of tuples, where each tuple is in the form `(transaction_id, participating_nodes, operations)`.
*   `dependencies`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(A, B)` signifies that transaction `A` depends on transaction `B`.

**Output:**

A list of `transaction_id` representing the global execution order of the transactions. If no valid execution order exists due to cyclic dependencies that cannot be resolved, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 1000
*   1 <= len(transactions) <= 100000
*   1 <= len(dependencies) <= 100000
*   Each `transaction_id` is a unique positive integer.
*   Each node identifier in `participating_nodes` is an integer between 0 and N-1.
*   The length of the `operations` list for each transaction is at most 10.
*   The length of each operation string is at most 20 characters.
*   The algorithm must complete within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).

**Example:**

```python
N = 3
transactions = [
    (1, {0, 1}, ["read A", "write B"]),
    (2, {1, 2}, ["read B", "write C"]),
    (3, {0, 2}, ["read C", "write A"])
]
dependencies = [(2, 1), (3, 2)]  # Transaction 2 depends on 1, 3 depends on 2
```

A possible valid output: `[1, 2, 3]`

**Note:** This problem requires you to design a sophisticated ordering algorithm that considers causality, concurrency, deadlock prevention, scalability, and fault tolerance. You may need to explore advanced techniques such as distributed consensus (e.g., Paxos or Raft), timestamp ordering, or graph-based dependency resolution. The focus is on the algorithm's correctness, efficiency, and robustness.

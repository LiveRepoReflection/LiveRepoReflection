Okay, I'm ready. Here's a coding problem designed to be challenging and complex.

**Problem Title:** Optimizing Public Transportation Routes

**Problem Description:**

A major metropolitan area is trying to optimize its public transportation system. The city's transportation network consists of a series of interconnected stations, each represented by a unique ID. Passengers need to travel between various origin and destination stations. Each station has some types of transportations for passengers to choose, e.g., bus, subway, tram. Each of the transportations has a cost and time duration. The network is represented as a directed graph where stations are nodes and the transportation routes between them are edges.

Your task is to design an algorithm that, given a set of passenger requests, determines the *optimal* routes for each passenger, minimizing a weighted sum of travel time and cost.

**Input:**

1.  **Stations:** A list of stations, each with a unique ID (integer) and available transportation methods (list of strings: "bus", "subway", "tram").
2.  **Routes:** A list of directed routes between stations. Each route specifies the origin station ID, destination station ID, transportation method (string), cost (float), and travel time (float).
3.  **Passenger Requests:** A list of passenger requests. Each request specifies an origin station ID, a destination station ID, a maximum acceptable cost (float), a maximum acceptable travel time (float), and a weight `w` (float) representing the importance of travel time relative to cost (higher `w` means travel time is more important).

**Output:**

For each passenger request, output the *optimal* route (a list of station IDs representing the path, including the origin and destination) that minimizes `w * travel_time + (1-w) * cost`, subject to the cost and time constraints. If no route satisfies the constraints, output "No suitable route found".

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The number of stations can be large (up to 10^5).
*   The number of routes can be very large (up to 10^6).
*   The number of passenger requests can be significant (up to 10^4).
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Multiple routes may exist between two stations with different transportation methods, costs, and travel times.
*   The optimal route may involve transfers between different transportation methods at intermediate stations.
*   The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle all passenger requests within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).
*   You need to handle the case where there is no possible route or no route that satisfies the maximum cost and time constraints.
*   Consider the trade-offs between different graph search algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A\*) and how they perform with large graphs and varying edge weights.
*   The `w` parameter allows for different passenger priorities (e.g., some passengers prioritize speed, others prioritize cost).

**Example:**

(Simplified for brevity)

*   **Stations:** `{1: ["bus", "subway"], 2: ["subway"], 3: ["bus"]}`
*   **Routes:** `{(1, 2, "subway", 5.0, 10.0), (1, 3, "bus", 3.0, 15.0), (2, 3, "bus", 2.0, 8.0)}`
*   **Request:** `(1, 3, 10.0, 20.0, 0.7)` (Origin 1, Destination 3, Max Cost 10, Max Time 20, Weight 0.7)

Possible routes and their scores:

1.  Direct route 1 -> 3: Cost = 3, Time = 15, Score = 0.7 * 15 + 0.3 * 3 = 11.4
2.  Route 1 -> 2 -> 3: Cost = 5 + 2 = 7, Time = 10 + 8 = 18, Score = 0.7 * 18 + 0.3 * 7 = 14.7

Optimal route: `[1, 3]`

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful handling of constraints to achieve an efficient and correct solution. Good luck!

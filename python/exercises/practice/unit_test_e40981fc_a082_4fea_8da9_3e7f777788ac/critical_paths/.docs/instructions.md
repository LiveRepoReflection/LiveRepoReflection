## Problem: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication Paths

**Description:**

Imagine a large-scale distributed system comprising numerous microservices. These services communicate with each other to fulfill various business functionalities. Due to network latency, service dependencies, and the sheer volume of requests, optimizing the communication paths between services is crucial for overall system performance and responsiveness.

You are given a directed graph representing the service architecture. Each node in the graph represents a microservice, and a directed edge from service A to service B indicates that service A makes requests to service B.  Each edge has an associated cost representing the average latency (in milliseconds) of communication between the two services.

Your task is to design and implement an algorithm that efficiently determines the *K* most critical communication paths within the system based on a combination of latency and traffic volume. Critical paths are defined as those that contribute most significantly to overall system latency due to high latency and/or high traffic volume.

**Input:**

1.  **Service Graph:** A directed graph represented as an adjacency list where keys are service IDs (integers) and values are lists of tuples. Each tuple represents a neighbor service and the latency of the edge: `graph = {service_id: [(neighbor_id, latency), ...], ...}`.
2.  **Traffic Volume:** A dictionary representing the average number of requests per second between services: `traffic = {(source_id, destination_id): requests_per_second, ...}`.
3.  **K:** An integer representing the number of most critical communication paths to return.

**Output:**

A list of the *K* most critical communication paths, sorted in descending order of their criticality score. Each path should be represented as a tuple: `(source_id, destination_id, criticality_score)`.  The criticality score is a calculated value reflecting the combined impact of latency and traffic volume. You must define your own criticality scoring function. A good scoring function should penalize high latency and high traffic volume.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scale:** The system can contain thousands of services and communication paths.  Your solution must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the graph is disconnected, contains cycles, or where the traffic volume data is incomplete.
*   **Criticality Score:** You have the freedom to define your own criticality scoring function, but it *must* take into account both latency and traffic volume. Justify your choice of scoring function in your solution. Consider using a non-linear function to emphasize particularly problematic paths.
*   **Tie-Breaking:** If multiple paths have the same criticality score, prioritize paths with higher latency. If latency is also the same, prioritize paths with higher traffic volume.
*   **K Value:**  If *K* is larger than the total number of communication paths, return all available paths, sorted by criticality.
*   **Optimization:** Aim for the most efficient algorithm possible. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize runtime.  Brute-force approaches will likely not pass performance tests.
*   **Memory Limit:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially given the potential scale of the graph. Avoid creating unnecessary copies of large data structures.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    1: [(2, 50), (3, 100)],
    2: [(4, 20)],
    3: [(4, 80)],
    4: []
}

traffic = {
    (1, 2): 1000,
    (1, 3): 500,
    (2, 4): 2000,
    (3, 4): 750
}

K = 2

# Expected Output (order may vary depending on your criticality score):
# [(2, 4, <score>), (1, 2, <score>)]  # Replace <score> with calculated values
```

This problem requires you to combine graph traversal, data analysis, and algorithm optimization to identify and prioritize critical communication paths in a complex distributed system. Good luck!

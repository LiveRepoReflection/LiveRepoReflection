## Question: Distributed Transaction Orchestration

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a distributed transaction orchestration system for a microservices architecture that manages a complex booking process for a travel company. The booking process involves several microservices: `UserService`, `FlightService`, `HotelService`, and `PaymentService`. A successful booking requires successful operations in all four services.

Each service has its own independent database, and the transaction needs to be ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across all services. Due to network latency and potential service failures, achieving this is challenging.

Your goal is to implement a robust transaction coordinator that can handle both successful and failed booking attempts using the Saga pattern with compensation transactions.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Coordination:** Implement a central transaction coordinator that initiates and monitors the booking process across the four microservices. The coordinator should use asynchronous messaging (e.g., a message queue like RabbitMQ or Kafka - you don't need to implement the messaging system itself, just assume it exists and you can publish and subscribe to messages) to communicate with the microservices.

2.  **Saga Implementation:** Implement the Saga pattern for managing the distributed transaction. The saga should involve the following steps:
    *   **UserService:** Reserve user account balance. (Compensation: Release user account balance).
    *   **FlightService:** Book flight seats. (Compensation: Cancel flight booking).
    *   **HotelService:** Book hotel rooms. (Compensation: Cancel hotel booking).
    *   **PaymentService:** Process payment. (Compensation: Refund payment).

3.  **Idempotency:** Design your system to be idempotent. Each service should be able to handle the same request multiple times without causing unintended side effects. This is critical for handling retries after failures. Use UUID/GUID to guarantee the Idempotency.

4.  **Failure Handling:** Implement proper error handling and compensation mechanisms. If any of the microservices fail during the booking process, the coordinator should initiate compensation transactions in the reverse order of the original operations to rollback the changes.

5.  **Concurrency:**  Your solution should handle concurrent booking requests efficiently. Consider potential race conditions when multiple users attempt to book the same resources (e.g., limited flight seats or hotel rooms). Use optimistic locking to prevent race conditions.

6.  **Partial Failure:** Handle scenarios where some compensation transactions might fail. Implement retry mechanisms for failed compensation transactions, with a maximum number of retries and exponential backoff. After multiple retries, log the failure and alert the system administrator.

7.  **Optimistic Locking:** Implement optimistic locking in the services to prevent race conditions. Each service should have a version number for the resources being booked (e.g., flight seats, hotel rooms). The service should check if the version number has changed before committing the transaction. If the version number has changed, the transaction should be aborted.

8.  **Logging and Monitoring:** Include logging statements to track the progress of the booking process and any errors that occur. Consider using a centralized logging system.

9.  **Scalability:** Your design should be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent booking requests. Consider using multiple instances of the transaction coordinator and the microservices.

10. **Deadline for Execution**: The entire booking process must complete within a specified time limit (e.g., 60 seconds). If the transaction coordinator does not receive confirmation from all services within the time limit, it should initiate compensation transactions for those that completed successfully.

**Constraints:**

*   Assume that the communication between the transaction coordinator and the microservices is unreliable. Network partitions and service outages can occur.
*   Assume each service can take a substantial amount of time (up to 10 seconds) to complete.
*   Optimize for speed, given the tight deadline of 60 seconds.
*   Optimize for resiliency, given the high chance of partial failure.
*   You are **not** required to implement the actual microservices (UserService, FlightService, etc.) or the message queue system. Focus on the transaction coordinator logic and the interaction with the assumed microservices.
*   Assume you have access to functions like `publish_message(service_name, message)` to send messages to the microservices and `subscribe_to_messages(service_name, callback)` to receive messages from the microservices. Implement the `callback` functions for each service.
*   All external API calls should be asynchronous.

**Deliverables:**

*   Code for the transaction coordinator, including the saga implementation and error handling mechanisms.
*   Code outlining the expected behavior within each microservice (even though you don't implement the services themselves), demonstrating how they would handle requests and compensation transactions.
*   A clear explanation of your design choices and the trade-offs you made.

This problem assesses your understanding of distributed transactions, the Saga pattern, error handling, concurrency control, and system design principles. The difficulty lies in the complexity of coordinating multiple services, handling failures, and ensuring data consistency in a distributed environment. Good luck!

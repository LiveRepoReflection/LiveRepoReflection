## Question: Real-Time Flight Path Optimization

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a real-time flight path optimization system for an airline. The airline operates a large network of flights between various airports. Your system needs to efficiently determine the optimal flight path for a given aircraft, considering various constraints and dynamically changing conditions.

**Input:**

*   A directed graph representing the airline's flight network. Each node in the graph represents an airport, and each directed edge represents a possible flight route between two airports.  Each edge has the following properties:
    *   `source`: The departure airport (string, airport code).
    *   `destination`: The arrival airport (string, airport code).
    *   `base_cost`: The base cost of the flight (integer).
    *   `base_time`: The base travel time of the flight in minutes (integer).
*   A list of aircraft, each with the following properties:
    *   `aircraft_id`: Unique identifier for the aircraft (string).
    *   `current_location`: The current airport the aircraft is at (string, airport code).
    *   `destination`: The desired destination airport for the aircraft (string, airport code).
    *   `departure_time`: The desired departure time in minutes from 00:00 (integer).
*   A list of real-time events that can affect the flight network. These events can be one of the following types:
    *   `WeatherDelay`: A delay at a specific airport that affects all outgoing flights from that airport.  Includes `airport_code` (string) and `delay_time` (integer, minutes).
    *   `RouteClosure`: A complete closure of a specific flight route. Includes `source` (string, airport code) and `destination` (string, airport code).
    *   `IncreasedDemand`: An increase in the base cost and base time for a specific flight route. Includes `source` (string, airport code), `destination` (string, airport code), `cost_increase` (integer), and `time_increase` (integer).
    *   `FuelPriceChange`: A change in the fuel price, which affects the cost of all flights. Includes `price_change_percentage` (float, e.g., 0.05 for a 5% increase).

**Output:**

For each aircraft in the input list, determine the optimal flight path from its `current_location` to its `destination`, considering the real-time events and the following optimization criteria:

*   **Minimize Total Cost:** The primary objective is to minimize the total cost of the flight path. The total cost is the sum of the costs of each flight segment in the path.
*   **Minimize Travel Time:**  The secondary objective is to minimize the total travel time of the flight path, *given* that the total cost is minimized.  If multiple paths have the same minimum cost, choose the path with the shortest travel time.
*   **Respect Departure Time:** The selected path should allow the aircraft to depart from its `current_location` as close as possible to its `departure_time`.  A penalty is applied to paths that depart later than the desired `departure_time`. The penalty is `(actual_departure_time - desired_departure_time) * penalty_per_minute`, where `penalty_per_minute` is a constant.

The output should be a list of optimal flight paths, one for each aircraft, represented as follows:

*   `aircraft_id`: The ID of the aircraft.
*   `path`: A list of airport codes representing the optimal flight path (including the starting airport). Empty list if no path is found.
*   `total_cost`: The total cost of the optimal flight path.
*   `total_time`: The total travel time of the optimal flight path in minutes.
*   `departure_delay`: The delay in departure time from the desired departure time in minutes.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 10,000 airports and 100,000 flight routes).
*   The number of aircraft can be significant (up to 1,000 aircraft).
*   The number of real-time events can be substantial (up to 10,000 events).
*   The system must be efficient enough to provide optimal flight paths in a reasonable time (e.g., within a few seconds) for all aircraft.
*   You can assume that an aircraft can only be at one airport at a time.
*   Aircraft cannot remain idle at an airport for extended periods unless a weather delay is in effect.
*   The graph may not be fully connected; there might not be a path between every pair of airports.
*   `penalty_per_minute` is a constant value (e.g., 10).

**Edge Cases:**

*   No path exists between the aircraft's `current_location` and its `destination`.
*   The aircraft's `current_location` is the same as its `destination`.
*   The graph contains cycles.
*   Real-time events conflict with each other (e.g., a route is closed and then immediately has its demand increased). Your system should handle these conflicts gracefully (e.g., by applying the events in the order they are received).
*   Weather delays can accumulate if multiple delays affect the same airport.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Choose appropriate data structures to efficiently represent the graph and the real-time events.
*   Implement an efficient pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A\*, Dijkstra's algorithm) to find the optimal flight path. Consider using heuristics to improve the search performance.
*   Optimize the code for performance, especially for large graphs and large numbers of aircraft and events.  Consider techniques like caching, memoization, and parallelization.
*   Handle real-time events efficiently without recomputing the entire flight network from scratch.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Consider how the system can be designed to handle a continuous stream of real-time events.
*   Think about how the system can be scaled to handle a growing number of airports, flight routes, and aircraft.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, data structure expertise, optimization skills, and system design thinking to develop a robust and efficient solution.  Good luck!

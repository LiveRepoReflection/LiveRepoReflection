**Network Congestion Router**

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing algorithm for a network of interconnected servers. The network can be represented as a weighted, directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent servers.
*   Edges represent network connections between servers.
*   Edge weights represent the current congestion level on that connection (higher weight = more congestion).

Given a network graph, a source server, and a destination server, find the *k* shortest paths (in terms of total congestion) from the source to the destination. However, to simulate real-world constraints and prevent trivial solutions, you also need to consider the following:

**Constraints:**

1.  **No Cycles:**  A single path cannot visit the same server more than once. This is to prevent infinite loops and ensure paths are meaningful.
2.  **Congestion Threshold:** You are given a global congestion threshold, *T*.  No single edge in any of the *k* shortest paths can have a congestion level *strictly greater* than *T*. This simulates a scenario where overly congested links are simply not usable. If *no paths* can satisfy this constraint, return an empty list.
3.  **Path Diversity:**  The *k* shortest paths should be as diverse as possible. To quantify diversity, we define a "similarity score" between any two paths as the number of shared edges.  Your algorithm should minimize the sum of pairwise similarity scores between the selected *k* paths.
4.  **Optimization:** The graph can be large (thousands of nodes and edges). Your solution must be reasonably efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.  Naive approaches that explore all possible paths will likely time out.
5.  **Tiebreaker:** If multiple sets of *k* paths satisfy the above conditions, choose the set with the lowest average path congestion (sum of edge weights in the paths, divided by k).

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the graph. Keys are server IDs (integers), and values are dictionaries representing outgoing connections. Each outgoing connection dictionary has server ID as a key and congestion level (an integer) as a value.  For example:

    ```python
    graph = {
        1: {2: 5, 3: 2},
        2: {4: 4},
        3: {2: 1, 4: 7},
        4: {}
    }
    ```

*   `source`: The ID of the source server (integer).
*   `destination`: The ID of the destination server (integer).
*   `k`: The number of shortest paths to find (integer).
*   `T`: The congestion threshold (integer).

**Output:**

A list of *k* shortest paths, where each path is a list of server IDs visited in order (including the source and destination). The paths should be sorted in ascending order of their total congestion. If there are fewer than *k* valid paths, return all of them. If no valid paths exist, return an empty list.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    1: {2: 5, 3: 2},
    2: {4: 4},
    3: {2: 1, 4: 7},
    4: {}
}
source = 1
destination = 4
k = 2
T = 6

# Possible output (order may vary depending on similarity tiebreaker):
# [[1, 3, 2, 4], [1, 2, 4]]
```

**Clarifications:**

*   Assume server IDs are unique and non-negative.
*   The graph is guaranteed to be valid.
*   It is possible for the source and destination to be the same server. In this case, the path is simply `[source]`.
*   *k* will always be a positive integer.
*   *T* will always be a non-negative integer.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal algorithms, constraint handling, and optimization techniques to achieve a correct and efficient solution.  Good luck!

## Question Description

You are given a set of `N` points on a 2D plane, represented as (x, y) coordinates. You are also given a target number of connected components, `K`. Your task is to place edges between these points such that:

1.  Each edge has a weight equal to the Euclidean distance between the two points it connects.
2.  The resulting graph has exactly `K` connected components. A connected component is defined as a set of nodes where a path exists between any two nodes in the set.
3.  The total weight of all edges is minimized.

Your goal is to determine the *minimum* total edge weight needed to achieve exactly `K` connected components.

**Input:**

*   `points`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(x, y)` represents the coordinates of a point on the 2D plane.
*   `K`: An integer representing the desired number of connected components in the final graph.

**Output:**

*   A float representing the minimum total edge weight required to achieve exactly `K` connected components.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `1 <= K <= N`
*   `-10^4 <= x, y <= 10^4`
*   The Euclidean distance should be calculated with double precision.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should have a time complexity significantly better than O(N^3). Solutions that time out on larger test cases will not be accepted.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   If `K == N`, no edges are needed, and the total weight is 0.
*   If `K == 1`, the graph needs to be fully connected.
*   Ensure your solution handles potential floating-point precision issues.
*   The points may be co-linear or co-located.

**Real-world Practical Scenarios:**

This problem models scenarios where you want to connect a set of locations with minimal infrastructure cost, while maintaining a certain level of network isolation (represented by the number of connected components).  Think of connecting server farms across a region with minimal fiber optic cable, but needing a certain number of isolated networks for security.

**System Design Aspects:**

Consider how you would scale this solution if the number of points (`N`) was significantly larger (e.g., millions).  Think about distributed computing techniques or approximate algorithms that could be employed.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful handling of edge cases. Good luck!

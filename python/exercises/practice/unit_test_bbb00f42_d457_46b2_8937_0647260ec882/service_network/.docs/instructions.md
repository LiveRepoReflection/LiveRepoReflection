## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication in a Microservice Architecture

### Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing inter-service communication in a large-scale microservice architecture. The system consists of `N` microservices, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. These services need to communicate with each other to fulfill user requests.

Direct service-to-service communication is expensive and inefficient, especially under heavy load. Therefore, a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) is used as an intermediary. Each service publishes messages to specific topics and consumes messages from topics it subscribes to.

The architecture is represented by the following data:

*   **`N`**: An integer representing the number of microservices.
*   **`subscriptions`**: A list of lists, where `subscriptions[i]` is a list of topic IDs that service `i` subscribes to. Topic IDs are integers.
*   **`publications`**: A list of lists, where `publications[i]` is a list of topic IDs that service `i` publishes to.
*   **`request_dependencies`**: A list of lists, where `request_dependencies[i]` is a list of service IDs that service `i` *directly* depends on to fulfill a request.  If service A depends on service B, it means service A needs to receive information (via message passing) from service B.  This represents the *direct* dependency; transitive dependencies also exist.
*   **`topic_costs`**: A dictionary where `topic_costs[topic_id]` is an integer representing the cost (e.g., network bandwidth usage, broker load) associated with each message published to that topic.

Your goal is to minimize the overall cost of inter-service communication while ensuring that all service dependencies are satisfied.  "Satisfaction" means that if service A depends on service B (directly or transitively), service B must ultimately publish to a topic that service A subscribes to (directly or indirectly).

**Constraints and Challenges:**

1.  **Transitive Dependencies:**  Service A might depend on service B, which depends on service C.  Therefore, A indirectly depends on C. Your solution must account for these transitive dependencies.
2.  **Indirect Subscriptions/Publications:** Service A may not directly subscribe to the topic service B publishes to. There must exist a chain of services and topic subscriptions/publications that connect service B's publication to service A's subscription.
3.  **Optimization:** You must minimize the total cost of publishing messages, which is the sum of `topic_costs` for all topics that are *actually* used for communication based on service dependencies. You should only publish to topics that are necessary to fulfill dependencies.
4.  **Efficiency:**  The number of services (`N`) can be large (up to 1000), and the number of topics can also be significant.  Your solution must be efficient in terms of time and space complexity.  Brute-force solutions will not pass.
5.  **Cyclic Dependencies:**  The `request_dependencies` graph may contain cycles. You need to handle cycles gracefully; for example, by ensuring that all services within a cycle can communicate with each other.
6.  **Connectivity:** Ensure that all services required to fulfill the dependencies are connected through the message broker. The message broker should support one-to-many and many-to-many topics.
7.  **Multiple Solutions:** There might be multiple valid solutions that satisfy all dependencies. You should aim to find a solution with the *minimum* total topic cost.
8.  **Real-world Considerations:** Think about how you might handle scenarios where services might fail or topics might become unavailable. While you don't need to implement fault tolerance explicitly, consider how your approach might be adapted to such scenarios.

**Input:**

*   `N`: (int) The number of microservices.
*   `subscriptions`: (list of lists of int) `subscriptions[i]` is a list of topic IDs that service `i` subscribes to.
*   `publications`: (list of lists of int) `publications[i]` is a list of topic IDs that service `i` publishes to.
*   `request_dependencies`: (list of lists of int) `request_dependencies[i]` is a list of service IDs that service `i` depends on.
*   `topic_costs`: (dict of int: int) `topic_costs[topic_id]` is the cost associated with publishing to `topic_id`.

**Output:**

*   (int) The minimum total cost of publishing messages to satisfy all service dependencies. If it's impossible to satisfy all dependencies, return `-1`.

Good luck!

## Question: Efficient Resource Allocation in a Microservice Architecture

**Description:**

You are designing a resource allocation system for a cloud provider that hosts a large number of microservices. Each microservice, when deployed, requests a specific amount of resources: CPU cores, RAM (in MB), and Disk space (in GB). The cloud provider has a finite pool of these resources.

The challenge is to design an efficient algorithm to allocate resources to microservices while minimizing the number of physical servers required to host them. You are given a list of microservice resource requests and the resource capacity of each available server.

Each microservice *must* be deployed on a single server. You cannot split a microservice across multiple servers. A server can host multiple microservices, as long as the total resource usage of the hosted microservices does not exceed the server's capacity. The resources are considered indivisible, meaning that a microservice must receive the entire amount of resources it requests.

**Input:**

*   `microservices`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a microservice's resource request in the format `(cpu_cores, ram_mb, disk_gb)`.
*   `servers`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a server's resource capacity in the format `(cpu_cores, ram_mb, disk_gb)`. You can assume that servers are identical.

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum number of servers required to host all microservices. If it is not possible to host all microservices with the given servers, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The number of microservices can be very large (up to 10^5).
*   The number of servers can be relatively small (up to 10^2), but potentially enough to host all microservices if packed efficiently.
*   Resource requests from microservices can vary significantly in size. Some microservices might be very small, while others might be close to the maximum server capacity.
*   The resource capacities of the servers can be relatively small or large.
*   You need to handle cases where not all microservices can be accommodated by the available servers.
*   The solution should be optimized for time complexity. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.
*   Assume all input values are non-negative integers.
*   The order of the microservices matters for optimization. Consider how to prioritize the order of allocation.

**Example:**

```python
microservices = [(2, 4096, 50), (1, 2048, 20), (3, 8192, 100), (1, 1024, 10), (2, 4096, 50)] # (cpu, ram, disk)
servers = [(4, 16384, 200)] # (cpu, ram, disk)

# One possible optimal allocation:
# Server 1: (2, 4096, 50), (1, 2048, 20), (1, 1024, 10)
# Server 2: (3, 8192, 100), (2, 4096, 50)

# Output: 2
```

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance. Solutions with exponential time complexity will likely fail. Dynamic programming or greedy approaches combined with sorting strategies may be beneficial.

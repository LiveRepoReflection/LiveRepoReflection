## Problem: Optimal Public Transport Routing

**Problem Description:**

The city of "Techtopia" is a rapidly growing metropolis with a complex public transport network. The network consists of `N` stations and `M` bidirectional routes connecting them. Each route has a `travel_time` (in minutes), a `cost` (in credits), and a `capacity`.

The city is expecting a massive influx of tourists for an upcoming tech convention. To handle the increased demand, the city authorities want to optimize public transport routes between critical locations.

Given a set of `K` pairs of "start" and "end" stations, your task is to find the **minimum cost route** (in credits) between each pair of stations, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Time Limit:** The route's total travel time must not exceed a given `max_travel_time` (in minutes).
2.  **Capacity Constraint:** The number of passengers using any route segment must not exceed its `capacity`. The number of passengers is given for each of the `K` pairs of stations.
3.  **Transfer Limit:** The number of transfers between routes must not exceed a given `max_transfers`. A transfer occurs when a passenger changes from one route to another at a station.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of stations (numbered from 0 to N-1).
*   `M`: The number of routes.
*   `routes`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a route: `(station1, station2, travel_time, cost, capacity)`. The routes are bidirectional.
*   `K`: The number of station pairs.
*   `station_pairs`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a station pair: `(start_station, end_station, num_passengers)`.
*   `max_travel_time`: The maximum allowed travel time (in minutes) for any route.
*   `max_transfers`: The maximum allowed transfers for any route.

**Output:**

A list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum cost (in credits) to travel between the corresponding station pair, adhering to the travel time, capacity, and transfer constraints.

If no such route exists for a given station pair, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 1000
*   1 <= `M` <= 5000
*   1 <= `K` <= 100
*   0 <= `station1`, `station2` < `N`
*   1 <= `travel_time` <= 60
*   1 <= `cost` <= 100
*   1 <= `capacity` <= 1000
*   1 <= `num_passengers` <= 1000
*   1 <= `max_travel_time` <= 1440 (24 hours in minutes)
*   0 <= `max_transfers` <= 10

**Efficiency Requirements:**

The solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., within a few seconds). Consider optimized graph traversal algorithms and data structures.

**Example:**

```python
N = 5
M = 6
routes = [
    (0, 1, 10, 5, 500),
    (0, 2, 15, 8, 300),
    (1, 2, 5, 3, 400),
    (1, 3, 20, 10, 600),
    (2, 4, 25, 12, 200),
    (3, 4, 10, 7, 700)
]
K = 2
station_pairs = [
    (0, 4, 150),
    (1, 3, 700)
]
max_travel_time = 60
max_transfers = 2

# Expected Output: [20, -1]
# For (0,4,150), the best route is 0->1->2->4 (5+3+12 = 20 cost, 10+5+25=40 time, 2 transfers). The route 0->2->4 is also possible but more expensive
# For (1,3,700), it exceeds capacity (600) so no path is possible.
```

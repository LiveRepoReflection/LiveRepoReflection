Okay, here's a challenging problem description designed with the requested elements in mind.

**Problem Title:**  Optimized Inter-City Package Routing

**Problem Description:**

A large e-commerce company, "OmniDeliver", needs to optimize its package delivery network between major cities in a country. They have a network of cities connected by various transportation routes (trucking, rail, air). Each route has a capacity (maximum number of packages it can handle per hour), a transit time (in hours), and a cost per package. Due to fluctuating fuel prices and logistical constraints, these values can change dynamically.

Given the current state of the OmniDeliver network, your task is to design an efficient algorithm that, upon receiving a series of delivery requests, determines the *optimal* route for each package.

**Specifics:**

*   **Network Representation:**  The delivery network is represented as a directed graph. Cities are nodes, and routes are directed edges. Each edge has three attributes: `capacity`, `transit_time`, and `cost_per_package`.

*   **Dynamic Updates:** The network is *dynamic*. You will receive updates to the `capacity`, `transit_time`, and `cost_per_package` for specific routes. These updates must be processed efficiently.

*   **Delivery Requests:**  Delivery requests arrive in a continuous stream. Each request specifies a `source_city`, a `destination_city`, and a `number_of_packages`.

*   **Optimization Goal:** The goal is to minimize the *total cost* of delivering all packages, *subject to the capacity constraints of each route*. The total cost is calculated as the sum of `(cost_per_package * number_of_packages_on_route)` for each route used.

*   **Real-time Constraints:** The system must respond to each delivery request in a timely manner. There is a strict time limit for processing each request and network update.  The exact time limit will be specified in the testing environment, but aim for an extremely performant solution.

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The number of cities in the network can be up to 10,000.
    *   The number of routes can be up to 100,000.
    *   The number of delivery requests can be up to 1,000,000.
    *   The number of network updates can be up to 100,000.
    *   Package splitting is allowed.  A single delivery request can be split across multiple routes if it results in a lower overall cost.
    *   Negative cycles are guaranteed *not* to exist in the cost structure of the graph.
    *   The input graph is guaranteed to be connected, meaning that a path exists between any two cities.

*   **Output:** For each delivery request, your algorithm must output the *minimum total cost* to deliver all packages from the source to the destination, considering all constraints. Output -1 if no route can satisfy the request.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Your algorithm must correctly compute the minimum cost for all test cases.
*   **Efficiency:** Your solution must be highly efficient in terms of both time and memory usage. Solutions that time out or exceed the memory limit will be penalized severely.
*   **Scalability:** Your solution should scale well to large networks and high volumes of delivery requests and updates.
*   **Code Clarity:**  While performance is paramount, your code should be reasonably well-structured and readable.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and efficient data structures. Consider techniques like:

*   Minimum cost flow algorithms (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson with cost scaling, or more efficient variants like the successive shortest path algorithm).
*   Efficient graph representation (e.g., adjacency lists or sparse matrices).
*   Heaps or priority queues for optimization.
*   Caching or memoization to reduce redundant computations.
*   Dynamic programming (potentially in combination with graph algorithms).
*   Careful attention to data structure choices to minimize memory usage.

Good luck! This is designed to be a very challenging problem.

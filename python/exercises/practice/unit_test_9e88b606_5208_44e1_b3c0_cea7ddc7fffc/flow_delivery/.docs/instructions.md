## Question: Multi-Commodity Flow with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints

### Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing the delivery of multiple commodities from various source locations to their respective destination locations within specified time windows, subject to capacity constraints on the transportation network.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a logistics company operating in a large city. They need to deliver different types of goods (commodities) from warehouses (sources) to retail stores (destinations). Each delivery has a specific time window within which it must arrive at the destination. The city's road network has capacity limitations on each street segment.

**Input:**

1.  **Network:** A directed graph representing the city's road network. Each edge (street segment) has:
    *   `start_node`: The starting node of the street segment.
    *   `end_node`: The ending node of the street segment.
    *   `capacity`: The maximum flow (number of trucks) that can traverse the street segment per unit of time.
    *   `travel_time`: Time (in minutes) required to travel through the street segment.

2.  **Commodities:** A list of commodities to be delivered. Each commodity has:
    *   `commodity_id`: A unique identifier for the commodity.
    *   `source`: The starting node (warehouse) for the commodity.
    *   `destination`: The ending node (retail store) for the commodity.
    *   `demand`: The amount of the commodity that needs to be delivered.
    *   `start_time`: The earliest time (in minutes) the commodity can leave the source.
    *   `end_time`: The latest time (in minutes) the commodity must arrive at the destination.

3.  **Truck Capacity:** A single truck can carry one unit of any commodity.

**Output:**

A schedule that minimizes the total number of trucks used to satisfy all demands. The schedule should specify:

*   For each commodity, the number of trucks dispatched.
*   For each truck of each commodity, the route (list of nodes visited) and the departure time from the source.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Flow Conservation:** For each node (except source and destination), the total inflow of each commodity must equal the total outflow of that commodity.
2.  **Capacity Constraints:** For each edge at any given time, the total flow (number of trucks) across that edge must not exceed its capacity.
3.  **Time Window Constraints:** Each truck delivering a commodity must depart from the source no earlier than the commodity's `start_time` and must arrive at the destination no later than the commodity's `end_time`.
4.  **Integer Flow:** The number of trucks dispatched on each route must be an integer.
5.  You can assume that each truck will depart immediately after another. It will not take any extra time.

**Optimization Goal:**

Minimize the total number of trucks used across all commodities while satisfying all demands and constraints.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution should be computationally efficient, especially for large network and commodity datasets.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.

**Edge Cases:**

*   No feasible solution exists (e.g., demand exceeds network capacity, time windows are impossible to satisfy).
*   Multiple optimal solutions exist; return any one of them.
*   Source and destination are the same node.

**Example:**

(A simplified example is difficult to represent concisely. Imagine a small network with two commodities, each with a source, destination, demand, and time window. The challenge is to find the routes and departure times for the trucks so that all demands are met within the time windows, respecting road capacities, and using the fewest possible trucks.)

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must satisfy all constraints.
*   Optimality: The solution should minimize the total number of trucks used.
*   Efficiency: The solution should run within a reasonable time limit.
*   Code Clarity: The code should be well-structured and easy to understand.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, network flow, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

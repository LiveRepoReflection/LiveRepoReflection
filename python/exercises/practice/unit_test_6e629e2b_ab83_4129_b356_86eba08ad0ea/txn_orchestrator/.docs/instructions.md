## Problem: Distributed Transaction Orchestration

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction orchestration system. This system needs to manage transactions across multiple independent services, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties.

Imagine an e-commerce platform where a user places an order. This seemingly simple action involves several services:

*   **Order Service:** Creates the order record.
*   **Inventory Service:** Reserves items from the inventory.
*   **Payment Service:** Processes the payment.
*   **Shipping Service:** Schedules the shipment.

These services are independent and communicate over a network. A successful order requires all four services to complete their respective actions. If any service fails, all the preceding actions must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Orchestration:** Implement a central orchestrator that coordinates the distributed transaction across the services. The orchestrator should define the execution flow and handle the rollback logic.
2.  **Idempotency:** Each service operation (e.g., reserve inventory, process payment) must be idempotent. This means that executing the same operation multiple times should have the same effect as executing it once. This is crucial for handling network issues and retries.
3.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Emulation:** Implement a mechanism resembling 2PC. The orchestrator first prepares all services to commit. Only if all services successfully prepare, does the orchestrator instruct them to commit. Otherwise, it initiates a rollback.  Note: You don't need to implement a full-fledged 2PC protocol; a simplified emulation focusing on the orchestration logic is sufficient.
4.  **Concurrency Handling:** The system should handle concurrent order requests efficiently. Consider potential race conditions and ensure data integrity.
5.  **Failure Handling:**  The system must be robust to failures. Implement mechanisms to handle service unavailability, network timeouts, and other potential errors. The orchestrator should retry operations with appropriate backoff strategies.  Consider scenarios where the orchestrator itself fails and needs to recover.
6.  **Scalability:** While a single orchestrator instance is sufficient for demonstration, discuss the potential scalability challenges and design considerations for handling a high volume of transactions.  How would you shard the transaction load? How would you manage distributed state?
7.  **Compensation:** Implement compensation operations for each service. These operations should undo the effects of the original actions during a rollback (e.g., release reserved inventory, refund payment).

**Constraints:**

*   **Simulate Service Interactions:** You don't need to set up actual microservices. Instead, simulate service interactions using functions or classes. These simulated services should have realistic behavior, including potential failures and delays.
*   **Focus on Orchestration Logic:** The primary focus should be on the transaction orchestration logic, including the 2PC emulation, failure handling, and compensation mechanisms.
*   **Efficiency:** Although the problem focuses on correctness and robustness, strive for reasonable efficiency. Avoid unnecessary overhead.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the system guarantee ACID properties?
*   **Robustness:** How well does the system handle failures and concurrency?
*   **Design:** Is the design well-structured, modular, and easy to understand?
*   **Scalability (Discussion):**  Does the solution demonstrate a good understanding of scalability challenges and potential solutions?
*   **Idempotency:** Are the service operations properly designed to be idempotent?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, transaction management, and concurrency control. A successful solution will demonstrate the ability to design and implement a robust and scalable transaction orchestration system. Good luck!

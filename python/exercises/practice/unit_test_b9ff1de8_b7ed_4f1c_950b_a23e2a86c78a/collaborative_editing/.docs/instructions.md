Okay, here's a challenging problem description for a high-level programming competition, aiming for LeetCode Hard difficulty:

**Problem Title: Real-Time Collaborative Document Editing**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing the core conflict resolution and operational transformation (OT) engine for a real-time collaborative document editing system.  Imagine a Google Docs-like application where multiple users can simultaneously edit the same document. The document is represented as a single string.

Your task is to implement a function that takes as input:

1.  `current_document`: The current state of the document (a string).
2.  `operations`: A list of operations received from different users. Each operation is a tuple: `(user_id, position, text, type)`.
    *   `user_id`: An integer representing the unique ID of the user who performed the operation.
    *   `position`: An integer representing the index in the `current_document` where the operation should be applied.
    *   `text`:  A string representing the text to be inserted or deleted. Empty string if it is a deletion.
    *   `type`: An enum (`INSERT` or `DELETE`) representing the type of operation.

Your function should return:

1.  `updated_document`: The new state of the document after applying all operations in a consistent and conflict-free manner.
2.  `transformed_operations`: A list of transformed operations. Each operation in this list corresponds to an operation in the input `operations` list, but transformed to be applicable to the `updated_document`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:**  Operations can arrive in any order and may be concurrent (affecting overlapping regions of the document).
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Your OT algorithm must correctly resolve conflicts between concurrent operations.  A common strategy is to prioritize operations based on `user_id` (lower `user_id` wins in case of conflicts) or the order in which operations are received, but you should implement a flexible solution that can accommodate different conflict resolution strategies.
*   **Operational Transformation (OT):** Implement a correct OT algorithm to ensure that operations are applied consistently and predictably across different clients, even in the presence of latency and concurrency.  Consider insert-insert, insert-delete, delete-insert, and delete-delete transformations.
*   **Efficiency:**  The algorithm should be efficient, especially for large documents and a high volume of concurrent operations.  Consider the time complexity of your OT algorithm. Pre-processing the operations list is allowed, but must be included in your time complexity analysis.
*   **Scalability:**  While you don't need to build a distributed system, think about how your algorithm could scale to handle many users and large documents.  Your data structures should be chosen with scalability in mind.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Empty document.
    *   Empty operations list.
    *   Operations with invalid positions (out of bounds).  Decide on a reasonable strategy for handling these (e.g., ignore, clip to valid range).
    *   Operations with empty text (especially deletions).
*   **Determinism:** Given the same initial document and the same set of operations (in the same order), the output should always be the same.
*   **Generalization:** The code should be flexible enough to handle different conflict resolution strategies (e.g., prioritize based on timestamp, user roles, etc.) without major code changes. Consider using a function or class to represent the conflict resolution strategy.

**Example:**

```python
# Assume INSERT = 0 and DELETE = 1

current_document = "hello world"
operations = [
    (1, 5, ", cruel", INSERT),  # User 1 inserts ", cruel" at position 5
    (2, 5, "big ", INSERT),   # User 2 inserts "big " at position 5
]

updated_document, transformed_operations = your_function(current_document, operations)

# Possible output (depending on conflict resolution strategy):
# updated_document = "hello, cruelbig  world"  # User 1's insert applied before User 2
# transformed_operations = [
#     (1, 5, ", cruel", INSERT),
#     (2, 12, "big ", INSERT) # Position transformed to account for User 1's insert
# ]
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  The algorithm produces the correct `updated_document` and `transformed_operations` for various test cases, including those with complex conflicts.
*   **Efficiency:**  The algorithm performs efficiently for large documents and a high volume of concurrent operations.
*   **Code Quality:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Handling of Edge Cases:** All edge cases are handled correctly.
*   **Scalability Considerations:** The design demonstrates consideration for scalability.
*   **OT Algorithm Correctness:** The OT algorithm is provably correct (at least in the comments).

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems concepts. It's designed to be challenging and requires careful planning and implementation. Good luck!

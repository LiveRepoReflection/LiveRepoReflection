## Question: Autonomous Drone Delivery Network Optimization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient delivery network for a fleet of autonomous drones operating in a densely populated urban environment. The city is represented as a weighted, undirected graph where nodes represent delivery locations (e.g., customer addresses, warehouses) and edges represent the possible flight paths between locations. The weight of each edge represents the flight time between the two connected locations.

Your goal is to minimize the average delivery time while considering several complex factors:

1.  **Drone Capacity:** Each drone has a limited carrying capacity (weight and volume) and can handle multiple deliveries per flight.

2.  **Battery Life:** Each drone has limited battery life, which translates to a maximum flight time. This constraint must be strictly enforced. Drones can only recharge at designated charging stations (a subset of the nodes in the graph). Recharging is instantaneous.

3.  **Time Windows:** Each delivery request has a specified time window (start and end time) within which the delivery must be completed. Deliveries outside the time window are considered failures.

4.  **Dynamic Requests:** Delivery requests arrive dynamically over time. Your system needs to adapt to new requests in real-time.

5.  **Drone Availability:** You have a limited number of drones available at different charging stations.

6.  **Weather Conditions:** Weather conditions impact flight times. You are given a function that, based on the current time, adjusts the flight time between any two locations.

**Input:**

*   A graph representation of the city (nodes, edges, weights). Edge weights (flight times) are baseline values before weather adjustments.
*   A list of charging station node IDs.
*   A list of delivery requests, each containing:
    *   Origin location (node ID).
    *   Destination location (node ID).
    *   Delivery weight and volume.
    *   Time window (start and end time).
*   A list of available drones, each containing:
    *   Current location (node ID - must be a charging station).
    *   Carrying capacity (weight and volume).
    *   Maximum flight time (battery life).
*   A function `get_adjusted_flight_time(node1, node2, current_time)` that returns the weather-adjusted flight time between two nodes at a given time.
*   A simulation duration (total time to simulate deliveries).

**Output:**

A schedule of drone flights for the simulation duration.  The schedule should specify for each drone:

*   A sequence of locations visited (including charging stations).
*   The time of arrival at each location.
*   The deliveries performed at each location (if any).

**Constraints:**

*   Minimize the average delivery time across all completed deliveries.
*   All deliveries must be completed within their specified time windows.
*   Drone capacity and battery life constraints must be strictly adhered to.
*   The number of drones and charging stations is significantly less than the number of delivery locations and requests.
*   The graph representing the city can be large (thousands of nodes and edges).
*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle a continuous stream of incoming delivery requests. Real-time responsiveness is crucial.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

*   **Percentage of deliveries completed within their time windows.**
*   **Average delivery time for completed deliveries.**
*   **Resource utilization (drone usage).**
*   **Runtime performance (how quickly the system adapts to new requests).**
*   **Adherence to constraints (capacity, battery life).**

**Note:**  This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques (e.g., route planning, scheduling), and potentially machine learning (for predicting future demand or weather conditions). You'll need to consider trade-offs between solution complexity, runtime performance, and delivery effectiveness.

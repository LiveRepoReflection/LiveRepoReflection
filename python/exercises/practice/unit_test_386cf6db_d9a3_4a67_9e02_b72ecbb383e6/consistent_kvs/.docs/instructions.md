## Question: Distributed Key-Value Store with Consistent Hashing

**Problem Description:**

Design and implement a simplified distributed key-value store. The store consists of `N` nodes, where `N` can dynamically change as nodes join or leave the cluster.  The key-value store should support the following operations:

*   `put(key, value)`: Stores the `value` associated with the `key` in the appropriate node(s).
*   `get(key)`: Retrieves the `value` associated with the `key` from the appropriate node(s). Returns `None` if the key is not found.

To distribute data and handle node failures gracefully, the key-value store must use consistent hashing. Each node in the cluster is assigned a range of keys based on its position on the consistent hash ring.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Consistent Hashing:** Implement consistent hashing to map keys to nodes. Use a simple hash function (e.g., `hash(key) % RING_SIZE`) where `RING_SIZE` is a predefined constant. Consider using a virtual node strategy (assigning multiple positions on the ring to each physical node) to improve data distribution.

2.  **Node Join/Leave:** Your system must handle nodes joining and leaving the cluster dynamically. When a node joins, it should take over its assigned key range. When a node leaves, its key range should be redistributed to the remaining nodes.

3.  **Data Replication:** To improve fault tolerance and data availability, implement data replication.  Each key should be replicated on `R` nodes, where `R` is a configurable replication factor. The `R` nodes should be the `R` successors on the consistent hash ring.

4.  **Data Consistency:** The key-value store should provide eventual consistency. When a `put` operation is performed, the write should be propagated to all `R` replicas. The `get` operation should retrieve data from one of the replicas. In case of conflicting values, you can implement a simple last-write-wins strategy based on a timestamp associated with each value.

5.  **Concurrency:** The key-value store should be able to handle concurrent `put` and `get` requests from multiple clients. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks) to prevent race conditions.

6.  **Optimization:** Aim for efficient `get` and `put` operations.  Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., dictionaries, hash tables) to store the key-value pairs on each node.  Minimize network latency where possible.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes `N` can vary from 1 to 100.
*   The replication factor `R` can vary from 1 to `N`.
*   The `RING_SIZE` should be a sufficiently large constant to provide a good distribution of keys (e.g., 1024).
*   The key and value can be assumed to be strings.
*   The size of the keys and values are limited. Assume maximum key length of 50 characters and maximum value length of 200 characters.
*   The system should be designed to handle a high volume of requests.
*   Minimize the impact of node failures on the availability of data.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty key or value strings.
*   Attempting to `get` a key that does not exist.
*   Node failures during `put` or `get` operations.
*   Concurrent `put` operations for the same key.
*   Handling the edge case where a node becomes the successor of itself on the ring (e.g., when there is only one node).

**Bonus (Optional):**

*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and handling node failures automatically (e.g., using heartbeats).
*   Implement a read repair mechanism to ensure data consistency across replicas.
*   Add support for different consistency levels (e.g., read after write, quorum).
*   Implement a command-line interface or API for interacting with the key-value store.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, including consistent hashing, data replication, and concurrency. It also requires careful consideration of edge cases and optimization strategies. Good luck!

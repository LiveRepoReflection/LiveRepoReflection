## Question: Optimized Multi-Source Weighted Shortest Path on a Massive Graph

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient algorithm to find the shortest path from multiple source nodes to *all* other nodes in a very large, weighted, directed graph.  This graph represents a complex network, such as a road network, social network, or a dependency graph in a large software project.

**Input:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (numbered from 0 to n-1).  `1 <= n <= 10^6`
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with weight `w`. `0 <= u, v < n` and `1 <= w <= 10^3`. The number of edges `m` is constrained by `1 <= m <= 5 * 10^6`.  There can be multiple edges between two nodes.
*   `sources`: A list of integers representing the source nodes.  `1 <= len(sources) <= 10^3`. All source nodes are valid node indices (i.e., `0 <= source < n`). Sources may contain duplicates.

**Output:**

*   A list of integers of length `n`, where the `i`-th element represents the shortest distance from *any* of the source nodes to node `i`. If a node is unreachable from any of the source nodes, its corresponding distance should be `-1`.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

1.  **Scale:** The graph is massive.  Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the specified node and edge counts within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Naive approaches will likely time out.
2.  **Weighted Edges:**  Edges have positive integer weights.
3.  **Directed Graph:** Edges are directed; the path from `u` to `v` is not necessarily the same as the path from `v` to `u`.
4.  **Multiple Sources:** You need to find the shortest distance from *any* of the source nodes to each node.  This is a multi-source shortest path problem.
5.  **Unreachable Nodes:** If a node cannot be reached from any of the source nodes, its distance should be `-1`.
6.  **Optimization:**  Memory usage should be carefully considered.  Avoid storing large intermediate data structures unnecessarily. Aim to optimize both time and space complexity.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where:
    *   The graph is disconnected.
    *   There are cycles in the graph.
    *   `sources` is empty (should return a list of `-1`s).
    *   There are self-loops (edges from a node to itself).
    *   The graph is a single node with no edges.
8.  **Duplicates:** Handle duplicate entries within the `sources` list without causing errors.
9.  **Efficiency:** Aim for an algorithm that performs significantly better than `O(len(sources) * n * log(n))` in practice, considering the number of sources and graph size. Consider approaches that reuse information or leverage optimized data structures.

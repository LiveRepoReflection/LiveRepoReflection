Okay, I'm ready. Here's a coding problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated:

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Orchestration

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture. Imagine a scenario where multiple independent services need to participate in a single, atomic transaction. If any service fails to complete its part of the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data consistency across all involved services.

**Scenario:**

Consider an e-commerce application where placing an order involves the following services:

1.  **Order Service:** Creates a new order record.
2.  **Payment Service:** Processes the payment for the order.
3.  **Inventory Service:** Decrements the stock of the ordered items.
4.  **Notification Service:** Sends an email to the user confirming the order.

All these services must execute their respective operations within a single transaction. If, for example, the Payment Service fails due to insufficient funds, the Order Service should cancel the order, the Inventory Service should not decrement stock, and no notification should be sent.

**Requirements:**

Implement a `TransactionCoordinator` class with the following methods:

*   `begin_transaction()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a transaction ID (UUID).
*   `register_participant(transaction_id, service_name, commit_function, rollback_function)`: Registers a service as a participant in the transaction. Each service provides a `commit_function` to execute its part of the transaction and a `rollback_function` to undo its changes if the transaction fails. The functions should be provided as callables (e.g., lambda functions or regular function references).
*   `commit_transaction(transaction_id)`: Attempts to commit the transaction. It executes the `commit_function` of each registered participant in the order they were registered. If any `commit_function` raises an exception, the transaction is considered failed, and the `rollback_transaction` method should be called.
*   `rollback_transaction(transaction_id)`: Rolls back the transaction. It executes the `rollback_function` of each participant in *reverse* order of registration. The rollback functions should handle potential exceptions gracefully (e.g., logging the error but continuing to rollback other participants).

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Atomicity:** The transaction must be atomic; either all participants commit successfully, or all participants roll back.
*   **Idempotency:**  The `commit_function` and `rollback_function` should be idempotent. This means that executing them multiple times should have the same effect as executing them once. This is crucial for handling potential failures and retries. In the actual implementation you are not required to implement this. You can assume that they are idempotent.
*   **Concurrency:** Assume that multiple transactions can be running concurrently. Your `TransactionCoordinator` must be thread-safe to handle concurrent calls to its methods. Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. Log any exceptions raised during commit or rollback operations. Ensure that the `rollback_transaction` method always attempts to rollback all participants, even if some rollbacks fail.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be designed with scalability in mind.  Think about how you could potentially distribute the transaction coordinator across multiple nodes in a real-world system (although you don't need to implement distribution in this exercise).
*   **Efficiency:** Optimize the performance of the commit and rollback operations. Avoid unnecessary overhead.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Attempting to register a participant with an invalid `transaction_id`.
*   Attempting to commit or rollback a non-existent `transaction_id`.
*   Registering multiple participants with the same `service_name` within the same transaction.
*   Participants that take a very long time to commit or rollback (consider implementing timeouts in a real-world scenario, but not required for this exercise).

**Bonus Challenge:**

*   Implement a mechanism to detect and handle "zombie" transactions (transactions that have been running for an excessively long time, potentially due to a service failure). This could involve setting timeouts on transactions and automatically rolling them back if they exceed the timeout.
*   Implement a recovery mechanism. If the transaction coordinator crashes, it should be able to recover its state upon restart and resume any in-flight transactions. (Hint: consider using persistent storage for transaction metadata).

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, error handling, and distributed systems concepts. Good luck!

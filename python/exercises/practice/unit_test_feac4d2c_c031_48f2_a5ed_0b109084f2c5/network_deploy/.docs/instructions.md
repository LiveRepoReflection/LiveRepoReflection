Okay, here's a problem description designed to be challenging and complex, keeping the spirit of a high-level programming competition question:

### Project Name

`OptimalNetworkDeployment`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing the communication network for a newly established, large-scale distributed computing platform. The platform consists of a set of `N` computational nodes, geographically distributed across a wide area. Each node is capable of performing independent computations, but communication between nodes is crucial for collaborative tasks and data sharing.

Your primary goal is to determine the **optimal placement** of a limited number of `K` routers to minimize the average latency for communication between any two nodes in the network.

**Network Model:**

*   The computational nodes are represented as points on a 2D plane, with coordinates (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) for node `i`. The coordinates are integers.
*   You need to place `K` routers, also at points on the same 2D plane. Router coordinates must also be integers.
*   Each computational node will connect to its *closest* router. Closeness is defined by Euclidean distance. If a node is equidistant to multiple routers, it connects to the router with the smallest index (0 to K-1).
*   Communication between two computational nodes will occur through their respective routers. The latency between two nodes `i` and `j` is defined as the sum of the distances:
    *   Distance from node `i` to its assigned router.
    *   Distance between the two routers assigned to nodes `i` and `j`.
    *   Distance from node `j` to its assigned router.
*   Routers can handle any number of connections.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 500  (Number of computational nodes)
*   1 <= `K` <= min(20, `N`) (Number of routers)
*   0 <= x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> <= 1000 for each node `i`.
*   You must determine the optimal locations for the `K` routers. These locations are NOT given.
*   Router locations must be within the range [0, 1000] for both x and y coordinates.
*   You must minimize the **average latency** between all pairs of distinct computational nodes. The average latency is defined as the sum of latencies between all distinct pairs of nodes, divided by the number of distinct pairs (N * (N - 1) / 2).

**Input:**

A list of tuples representing the coordinates of the computational nodes.
```python
nodes = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xN, yN)]
```
The number of routers `K`.

**Output:**

A list of tuples representing the (x, y) coordinates of the `K` routers, in order of router index (0 to K-1). This list represents the router placement that minimizes the average latency across the network.

```python
router_locations = [(rx1, ry1), (rx2, ry2), ..., (rxK, ryK)]
```

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be judged based on the average latency achieved. Solutions with lower average latency will receive higher scores. Efficiency of your solution is important, as there will be a time limit.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   Nodes may be located at the same coordinates.
*   Multiple router placements may result in the same minimal average latency. Any of these placements will be considered a correct solution.
*   The problem emphasizes finding a *good* solution within the time limit, not necessarily the absolute *best* solution. Heuristic approaches are encouraged.
*   The placement of routers significantly impacts the latency. Consider the distribution of nodes when determining router placement strategies.
*   Think about efficient algorithms for computing distances, assigning nodes to routers, and calculating average latency. Naive approaches will likely time out.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of the problem constraints. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Python programming problem:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Key-Value Store with Consistent Hashing and Replication

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed key-value store. This store should handle a large number of keys and provide fault tolerance through data replication. The system consists of `N` servers (nodes), where `N` can vary.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Consistent Hashing:** Implement consistent hashing to distribute keys across the `N` servers. Use a hash ring of size `2^32`. Each server is assigned a position on the ring (e.g., using its IP address hashed).

2.  **Data Replication:** Implement data replication for fault tolerance. Each key should be replicated `R` times, where `R` is a configurable parameter and `1 <= R <= N`. The `R` replicas should be placed on the `R` servers that follow the primary server (the server initially responsible for the key based on consistent hashing) in the hash ring.

3.  **Basic Operations:** Implement the following operations:
    *   `put(key, value)`: Stores the given `key` and `value` in the distributed store. The `key` and `value` are strings.
    *   `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the given `key`. If the key is not found, return `None`.
    *   `delete(key)`: Deletes the `key` and its associated value from the store.

4.  **Node Joining/Leaving:** The system must handle nodes joining and leaving the cluster gracefully. When a node joins, it should take over a portion of the keys from existing nodes. When a node leaves, its keys should be redistributed to the remaining nodes.  Assume that you have a separate mechanism to detect node failures and new node additions.  For simplicity, you do not need to implement this detection mechanism. Instead, you are given a list of active nodes when the node topology changes. When nodes join/leave, the system must automatically adjust key assignments and data replication.

5.  **Data Consistency:** When a node joins or leaves, ensure that the data is transferred and replicated correctly to maintain data consistency. This means after the redistribution, all `R` replicas of each key should still exist.

**Constraints:**

*   **Efficiency:**  The `get`, `put`, and `delete` operations should be as efficient as possible.  Consider the time complexity of your consistent hashing implementation and replication strategy.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of keys and nodes. Your solution should be designed with scalability in mind.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to tolerate the failure of up to `R-1` nodes without data loss.
*   **Data Size:** Each key and value can be up to 1MB in size.
*   **Number of Nodes:** `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   **Replication Factor:** `1 <= R <= N`
*   **Keys:**  Assume keys are relatively evenly distributed across the hash space.

**Further Considerations (Optional, but recommended):**

*   **Conflict Resolution:** Consider how to handle potential conflicts if multiple clients attempt to write to the same key concurrently (e.g., using timestamps or version vectors).  You don't need to fully implement this, but explain your design approach.
*   **Data Partitioning:** How would you handle very large datasets that exceed the storage capacity of a single node? Consider data partitioning strategies (e.g., range partitioning).

**Input:**

The problem doesn't involve direct console input/output. Instead, you will be evaluated on the correctness and performance of your implementation based on a series of API calls (`put`, `get`, `delete`) and simulated node joining/leaving scenarios. You are expected to provide a class or set of functions that implement the key-value store functionality.

**Output:**

The `get` operation should return the value associated with the key or `None` if the key is not found. The `put` and `delete` operations do not need to return any value.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the implementation.
*   Efficiency of the operations.
*   Scalability of the design.
*   Fault tolerance.
*   Handling of node joining/leaving.
*   Clarity and organization of the code.
*   Explanation of design choices and trade-offs.
*   Handling of edge cases and constraints.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, consistent hashing, data replication, and algorithm design. It emphasizes practical considerations for building a scalable and fault-tolerant key-value store. Good luck!

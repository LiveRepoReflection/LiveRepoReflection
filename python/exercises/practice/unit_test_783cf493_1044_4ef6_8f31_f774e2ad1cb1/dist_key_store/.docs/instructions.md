Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging, incorporating several of the elements you requested.

### Project Name

`DistributedKeyStore`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed key-value store. This key-value store must be able to handle a high volume of read and write requests, and it must be resilient to node failures.  Assume the key-value store is used to store metadata for a large number of files. Keys are strings (representing file paths), and values are serialized byte arrays (representing file metadata).

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Data Storage:** The data must be distributed across multiple nodes.
2.  **Data Consistency:** The system must provide eventual consistency. Reads should eventually reflect the latest writes.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to tolerate the failure of a minority of nodes.
4.  **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale horizontally by adding more nodes.
5.  **Concurrency:** The system should handle concurrent read and write requests efficiently.
6.  **API:** Implement the following API:

    *   `put(key: str, value: bytes)`: Stores the key-value pair in the distributed key-value store.
    *   `get(key: str) -> bytes | None`: Retrieves the value associated with the key. Returns `None` if the key does not exist.
    *   `delete(key: str)`: Deletes the key-value pair from the store.
    *   `health_check() -> bool`: Check if the store is healthy or not.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Hashing:** Implement a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute keys across nodes. Research and implement either Rendezvous Hashing or Consistent Hashing with Virtual Nodes.  Justify your choice.
*   **Replication:** Implement data replication to ensure fault tolerance. Each key-value pair should be replicated on `N` nodes (replication factor). `N` will be a configurable parameter.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a mechanism to resolve write conflicts. A simple last-write-wins strategy based on timestamps is acceptable for initial implementation. Consider potential issues with clock synchronization in a distributed environment.
*   **Node Discovery:**  Assume a simple mechanism for node discovery (e.g., a configuration file containing a list of node addresses).
*   **Network Communication:**  Use a suitable networking library (e.g., `socket`, `asyncio`, `grpc`) for communication between nodes.  Consider the overhead of network calls when designing the system.
*   **Data Size:**  Assume the values (serialized byte arrays) can be relatively large (up to 1MB). Optimize for efficient data transfer.
*   **Scalability:** The distributed system can scale to thousands of files.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   **Optimization:** The `get` operation should be optimized for speed. Consider caching strategies.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  Implement a `Node` class representing a single node in the distributed key-value store. Each node should:

    *   Maintain a local data store (e.g., a dictionary or a key-value database like LevelDB or RocksDB).
    *   Implement the `put`, `get`, and `delete` operations for its local data store.
    *   Handle communication with other nodes for replication and conflict resolution.
    *   Implement the consistent hashing logic to determine which nodes are responsible for a given key.
    *   Implement the health_check operation.

2.  Implement a `Client` class that interacts with the distributed key-value store. The client should:

    *   Route requests to the appropriate nodes based on the consistent hashing algorithm.
    *   Handle replication and conflict resolution.
    *   Provide the `put`, `get`, and `delete` API to the user.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanism (e.g., vector clocks).
*   Implement a caching layer to improve read performance.
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the health and performance of the nodes.
*   Implement data compression to reduce storage space and network bandwidth.
*   Implement some kind of security such as access control.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, and algorithms. It also tests the ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Good luck!

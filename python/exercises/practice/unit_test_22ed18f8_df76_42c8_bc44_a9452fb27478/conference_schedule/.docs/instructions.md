## Question: Optimal Conference Scheduling

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal scheduling algorithm for a large academic conference. The conference has a fixed number of rooms, and a large number of paper presentations (talks) that need to be scheduled across multiple days. Your goal is to maximize the *total attendance points* of all scheduled talks, subject to several constraints.

Each talk has the following attributes:

*   **`id`**: A unique identifier for the talk.
*   **`startTime`**: The start time of the talk (represented as minutes from the start of the conference, e.g., 9:00 AM on Day 1 would be 9\*60 = 540).
*   **`endTime`**: The end time of the talk (represented as minutes from the start of the conference).  Note that `endTime > startTime`.
*   **`expectedAttendance`**: The estimated number of attendees for the talk.
*   **`keywords`**: A list of keywords associated with the talk.

Each room has the following attribute:

*   **`id`**: A unique identifier for the room.

The conference has the following constraints:

1.  **No Overlapping Talks in the Same Room:** No two talks can be scheduled in the same room if their time slots overlap.  Two talks overlap if they share any common time (e.g. Talk A: 540-600 and Talk B: 590-620 overlap).
2.  **Keyword Diversity:** To encourage attendees to explore different topics, we want to discourage scheduling talks with overlapping keywords in the same timeslot, even in different rooms.  For each timeslot (defined as a contiguous block of time, e.g., 9:00-10:00 AM), calculate the number of *unique* keywords across all *concurrent* talks. If the number of keywords is less than K, apply a penalty to the *total attendance points* of all the talks in that timeslot.
3.  **Room Capacity:** Each room has unlimited capacity.

You need to write a function that takes the list of talks, the list of rooms, the conference duration (in minutes), the value of K (minimum keyword diversity), and returns the schedule that maximizes the total attendance points while satisfying the constraints.

**Input:**

*   `talks`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a talk and has the keys `id`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `expectedAttendance`, and `keywords`.
*   `rooms`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a room and has the key `id`.
*   `conferenceDuration`: An integer representing the total duration of the conference in minutes.
*   `K`: An integer representing the minimum keyword diversity required for each timeslot.
*   `penaltyFactor`: A float representing the penalty factor if the keyword diversity does not meet the requirement. The penalty applies to the total attendance points of the talks in the timeslot.

**Output:**

A dictionary representing the optimal schedule. The keys of the dictionary are room IDs, and the values are lists of talk IDs scheduled in that room, sorted by start time.

**Example:**

```python
talks = [
    {'id': 1, 'startTime': 540, 'endTime': 600, 'expectedAttendance': 100, 'keywords': ['AI', 'ML']},
    {'id': 2, 'startTime': 540, 'endTime': 600, 'expectedAttendance': 80, 'keywords': ['Data Science', 'Statistics']},
    {'id': 3, 'startTime': 600, 'endTime': 660, 'expectedAttendance': 120, 'keywords': ['AI', 'Robotics']},
    {'id': 4, 'startTime': 600, 'endTime': 660, 'expectedAttendance': 90, 'keywords': ['Cloud Computing', 'Security']},
    {'id': 5, 'startTime': 540, 'endTime': 600, 'expectedAttendance': 70, 'keywords': ['AI', 'Robotics', 'Data Mining']},
]
rooms = [{'id': 'A'}, {'id': 'B'}]
conferenceDuration = 720 # 12 hours
K = 4
penaltyFactor = 0.5

# Expected output (this is just an example, the optimal solution may vary):
# {
#     'A': [1, 4],
#     'B': [3, 2]
# }
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of talks can be very large (up to 10,000).
*   The number of rooms can be moderate (up to 50).
*   The conference duration can be long (up to 1440 minutes, i.e., 24 hours).
*   The `startTime` and `endTime` are always within the conference duration.
*   Your solution must be efficient and should run within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few minutes).
*   Multiple valid schedules might exist. Your solution should find one that maximizes the total attendance points after penalty reduction.

**Note:** You are free to use any standard Python libraries. However, you should focus on designing an efficient algorithm and data structures to solve this problem.  Consider the trade-offs between different approaches, such as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, or optimization techniques like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, and justify your choice.

## Project Name

**Scalable Content Recommendation Engine**

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable content recommendation engine for a large online platform. The platform has millions of users and a vast catalog of content (articles, videos, products, etc.). The goal is to provide personalized content recommendations to each user in real-time to maximize engagement and conversion.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Real-Time Recommendation:** The system must generate recommendations in real-time (within milliseconds) upon user request.

2.  **Scalability:** The system must handle millions of users and content items, with the ability to scale horizontally to accommodate future growth.

3.  **Personalization:** Recommendations should be personalized based on user history (e.g., past views, purchases, ratings), user profile data (e.g., age, location, interests), and content metadata (e.g., category, tags).

4.  **Multiple Recommendation Strategies:** Implement at least three different recommendation strategies, including:

    *   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommend items similar to those the user has interacted with in the past.
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommend items that users with similar tastes have liked or interacted with. Consider both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.
    *   **Popularity-Based Recommendation:** Recommend popular items, especially for new users with limited history. You need to handle bias and popularity trends.

5.  **Hybrid Approach:** Implement a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of the different strategies.  The system should dynamically adjust the weights of each strategy based on the user's history and the availability of data.

6.  **Cold Start Problem:** Address the cold start problem for both new users and new content items. For new users, leverage user profile data and popularity-based recommendations. For new content items, utilize content metadata and initial popularity signals.

7.  **Data Storage:** Design an efficient data storage solution for user history, user profiles, content metadata, and recommendation models. Consider using a combination of relational and NoSQL databases, or graph databases, based on performance and scalability needs.

8.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Implement a mechanism to evaluate the performance of the recommendation engine using appropriate metrics such as click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, precision, recall, and NDCG.  The system should support A/B testing of different recommendation strategies.

9.  **System Architecture:** Design a modular and scalable system architecture that can be deployed in a distributed environment. Consider using microservices architecture.

**Constraints:**

*   **Memory:** The system should be memory-efficient to handle a large number of users and items. In particular, Collaborative Filtering should not load the entire User-Item interaction matrix into memory.
*   **Latency:** The recommendation API should have a maximum latency of 50ms for 99th percentile requests.
*   **Data Staleness:** User history and content metadata are updated frequently. The recommendation engine must be able to handle these updates in real-time or near real-time.
*   **Bias:** Be aware of potential biases in the data (e.g., popularity bias, selection bias) and implement techniques to mitigate them.

**Specific Instructions:**

*   Focus on designing the core recommendation logic and data structures.
*   Provide clear explanations of your design choices and trade-offs.
*   Include comments in your code to explain the implementation details.
*   Explain how the system will handle the constraints and address the challenges mentioned above.
*   Assume the existence of helper functions (e.g. Data Access Objects) for retrieving user data and content metadata.

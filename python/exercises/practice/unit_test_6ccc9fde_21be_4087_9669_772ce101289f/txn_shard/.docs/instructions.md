Okay, here's a challenging programming problem designed to test a candidate's proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and optimization.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator with Dynamic Sharding

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a NoSQL database. This database stores data in shards across multiple nodes. The coordinator is responsible for ensuring atomicity and consistency across multiple shard operations within a single transaction.

**Database Model:**

Imagine a NoSQL database where data is stored as key-value pairs. The keys are strings, and the values are integers. The database is sharded across `N` nodes.  Each node is responsible for a range of keys.  The mapping of keys to nodes is managed by the coordinator. This mapping can change dynamically, meaning shards can be split, merged, or moved between nodes for load balancing.

**Transaction Protocol:**

Implement a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol. The coordinator manages the transaction lifecycle.

1.  **Prepare Phase:**  The coordinator sends a "prepare" message to all nodes involved in the transaction. Each node attempts to perform the requested operations (read, write, delete) but *does not commit* the changes to the persistent store yet. Each node responds with either "ACK" (prepared successfully) or "NACK" (failed to prepare).  Nodes must hold locks to prevent conflicts.
2.  **Commit/Abort Phase:** If *all* nodes respond with "ACK," the coordinator sends a "commit" message to all involved nodes.  Each node then commits the changes to its persistent store. If *any* node responds with "NACK," the coordinator sends an "abort" message to all involved nodes. Each node then rolls back any temporary changes and releases locks.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Dynamic Sharding:** The key-to-node mapping is not fixed. The coordinator must maintain an up-to-date view of the shard distribution. The coordinator must also handle requests for transaction operations for keys that span across multiple nodes. Shard splitting, merging, and moving operations can occur concurrently with transactions. These operations can only affect shards that are not involved in active transactions. The coordinator should be able to update the shard mapping information without interrupting ongoing transactions.

2.  **Concurrency and Locking:** The coordinator must handle concurrent transaction requests. Nodes must use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent data corruption and ensure isolation between transactions. Implement deadlock detection or prevention.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** Implement basic fault tolerance. If a node fails during the prepare phase, the coordinator should automatically abort the transaction. If the coordinator fails before sending the commit/abort message, the nodes should resolve the transaction after a timeout period (e.g., using a consensus algorithm within the nodes involved or by querying a backup coordinator). Assume node failures are detectable.

4.  **Optimization:** Optimize for throughput. Minimize the latency of transactions, especially when involving multiple shards. Consider techniques like parallelizing operations where possible.

5.  **API:** Implement the following API:

    *   `begin_transaction()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a transaction ID.
    *   `read(transaction_id, key)`: Reads the value associated with a key within the specified transaction.
    *   `write(transaction_id, key, value)`: Writes a value to a key within the specified transaction.
    *   `delete(transaction_id, key)`: Deletes a key within the specified transaction.
    *   `commit_transaction(transaction_id)`: Commits the specified transaction.
    *   `abort_transaction(transaction_id)`: Aborts the specified transaction.
    *   `update_shard_mapping(shard_mappings)`: Updates shard mappings in the coordinator.

**Constraints:**

*   Assume a relatively small number of nodes (e.g., 5-20).
*   Assume a reasonable load of concurrent transactions.
*   Focus on correctness and concurrency first, then optimization.
*   Assume reliable message passing between the coordinator and nodes (no message loss or corruption). However, node failures are possible.
*   The key space is large (e.g., strings of up to 256 characters).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the implementation correctly handle transactions across multiple shards while maintaining atomicity and consistency?
*   Concurrency: Does the implementation handle concurrent transactions efficiently?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does the implementation handle node failures gracefully?
*   Performance: Does the implementation achieve reasonable throughput and latency?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. It allows candidates to demonstrate their ability to design and implement a complex system under challenging constraints. Good luck!

## Project Name:

`Autonomous Traffic Management System (ATMS)`

## Question Description:

You are tasked with designing a core component of an Autonomous Traffic Management System (ATMS) for a large, densely populated city. This system aims to optimize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and reduce overall travel times. The city's road network can be represented as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments connecting them. Each road segment has a capacity (maximum number of vehicles it can handle per unit time), a length, and a set of traffic lights that can influence traffic flow.

Your specific task is to implement a dynamic route planning module that can efficiently calculate the fastest route between any two intersections in the city, considering real-time traffic conditions and dynamically adjusting to changing congestion levels.

**Input:**

*   A directed graph representing the city's road network. The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each key is an intersection (node) ID and the value is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a road segment: `(destination_intersection_id, capacity, length, traffic_light_pattern)`.
    *   `destination_intersection_id`: The ID of the intersection this road segment leads to.
    *   `capacity`: An integer representing the maximum number of vehicles the road segment can handle per unit time.
    *   `length`: An integer representing the physical length of the road segment.
    *   `traffic_light_pattern`: A list of integers representing the cycle of green light durations for the road segment. Each integer represents the time (in seconds) the traffic light is green. After the last element, the cycle repeats from the beginning. Assume red light duration = constant(e.g. 30 seconds).
*   A dictionary representing real-time traffic conditions. The keys are tuples of `(source_intersection_id, destination_intersection_id)` representing road segments and the values are integers representing the current number of vehicles on that road segment.
*   A source intersection ID.
*   A destination intersection ID.
*   `time_unit`: int, representing the smallest unit of time the system considers (e.g., 1 second).
*   `look_ahead`: int, representing the time horizon (in `time_unit`s) for predicting traffic conditions. The route planning algorithm needs to account for how traffic conditions might evolve over the next `look_ahead` units of time.

**Output:**

*   A list of intersection IDs representing the fastest route from the source to the destination, considering current and predicted traffic conditions. Return an empty list if no route exists.
*   The estimated travel time (in `time_unit`s) for the calculated route. Return `-1` if no route exists.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Dynamic Traffic Conditions:** The travel time on a road segment depends on the current traffic conditions. A higher number of vehicles on a road segment increases travel time. The relationship between vehicle count and travel time is non-linear, increasing rapidly as the number of vehicles approaches the road segment's capacity. You can model this relationship using a suitable function (e.g., a piecewise function or a sigmoid function).

2.  **Traffic Light Patterns:** The travel time on a road segment is also affected by traffic lights. You need to consider the traffic light pattern and the current time to determine the waiting time at the intersection before entering the road segment.

3.  **Prediction:** You need to predict how traffic conditions will evolve over the next `look_ahead` time units. A simplistic prediction model could assume that the current vehicle count on each road segment remains constant. A more sophisticated model could consider the inflow and outflow of vehicles at each intersection.

4.  **Optimization:** The goal is to find the *fastest* route, not necessarily the shortest route in terms of distance. The route planning algorithm needs to balance the length of road segments with their current and predicted traffic conditions and traffic light delays.

5.  **Scalability:** The city's road network is large, so the route planning algorithm needs to be efficient. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize the time complexity.

6.  **Edge Cases:**

    *   Handle cases where no route exists between the source and destination.
    *   Handle cases where the source and destination are the same.
    *   Handle cases where the graph is disconnected.
    *   Consider integer overflows during travel time calculations.

7.  **Time Complexity:** Aim for an algorithm with a time complexity suitable for real-time applications. Algorithms like A\* or Dijkstra's algorithm with appropriate heuristics could be considered, but they need to be adapted to handle the dynamic traffic conditions and traffic light patterns efficiently.

8. **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially for large road networks.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    'A': [('B', 50, 100, [30, 40]), ('C', 30, 200, [20, 30])],
    'B': [('D', 40, 150, [40, 50])],
    'C': [('D', 60, 100, [30, 40])],
    'D': []
}

traffic_conditions = {
    ('A', 'B'): 20,
    ('A', 'C'): 10,
    ('B', 'D'): 30,
    ('C', 'D'): 40
}

source = 'A'
destination = 'D'
time_unit = 1
look_ahead = 60

route, travel_time = find_fastest_route(graph, traffic_conditions, source, destination, time_unit, look_ahead)

# Expected output (may vary depending on the implementation and the traffic model)
# route: ['A', 'C', 'D']
# travel_time: 250 (approximate, depends on traffic model and light pattern)
```

**This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. It also demands the ability to model real-world scenarios and make trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.**

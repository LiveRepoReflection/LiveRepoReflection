## Question: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Resource Constraints

### Project Name: `constrained_scheduler`

### Question Description:

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduler for a distributed computing system.  The system consists of a cluster of heterogeneous machines, each with varying processing capabilities and available memory.  A set of tasks needs to be executed, each with specific resource requirements (CPU cores and memory) and dependencies on other tasks.

**Tasks:**

Each task is represented by a unique integer ID. Each task also has the following attributes:

*   `task_id`: A unique integer identifying the task.
*   `cpu_cores`: An integer representing the number of CPU cores required by the task.
*   `memory_gb`: A float representing the amount of memory (in GB) required by the task.
*   `dependencies`: A list of `task_id`s that must be completed before this task can start.
*   `estimated_runtime`: A float representing the estimated execution time of the task.

**Machines:**

Each machine in the cluster is represented by a unique integer ID. Each machine has the following attributes:

*   `machine_id`: A unique integer identifying the machine.
*   `total_cpu_cores`: An integer representing the total number of CPU cores available on the machine.
*   `total_memory_gb`: A float representing the total amount of memory (in GB) available on the machine.

**Objective:**

Your goal is to devise a scheduling algorithm that minimizes the **makespan**, which is the total time it takes to complete all tasks. The schedule must adhere to the following constraints:

1.  **Dependency Constraint:** A task can only be started after all its dependencies are completed.
2.  **Resource Constraint:** A task can only be assigned to a machine if the machine has sufficient available CPU cores and memory to accommodate the task's requirements at the time of execution.  Multiple tasks can run concurrently on the same machine, as long as the resource constraints are satisfied.
3.  **Machine Constraint:** Each task should run on **only one** machine. You cannot split a task to run on multiple machines.

**Input:**

The input to your solution will consist of:

*   A list of `Task` objects, representing the tasks to be scheduled.
*   A list of `Machine` objects, representing the machines in the cluster.

**Output:**

Your function should return a schedule represented as a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary are `task_id`s, and the values are tuples containing:

*   `machine_id`: The ID of the machine the task is assigned to.
*   `start_time`: The time at which the task starts execution.
*   `end_time`: The time at which the task finishes execution.

**Example:**

```python
# Example Schedule (Illustrative)
schedule = {
    1: (101, 0.0, 5.0),  # Task 1 runs on Machine 101 from time 0.0 to 5.0
    2: (102, 2.0, 7.0),  # Task 2 runs on Machine 102 from time 2.0 to 7.0
    3: (101, 5.0, 8.0)   # Task 3 runs on Machine 101 from time 5.0 to 8.0
}
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of tasks can be up to 1000.
*   The number of machines can be up to 100.
*   The CPU cores required by a task can be up to the maximum available on any machine.
*   The memory required by a task can be up to the maximum available on any machine.
*   The estimated runtime of a task can be any positive float.
*   The `task_id`s and `machine_id`s are unique.
*   The dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). There are no circular dependencies.

**Optimization Requirements:**

Your primary goal is to minimize the makespan.  Your solution will be evaluated based on the makespan achieved for a set of test cases.  Solutions with shorter makespans will receive higher scores.  Consider techniques such as:

*   Task prioritization (e.g., critical path scheduling).
*   Machine selection strategies.
*   Backfilling to utilize idle resources.

**Real-world Considerations:**

This problem is a simplified model of real-world task scheduling challenges in cloud computing environments.  Factors such as network latency, data locality, and task preemption are not considered here, but could be extensions to this problem.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:**

Due to the potential size of the input, efficient algorithms and data structures are essential for achieving optimal performance.  Brute-force approaches will likely be too slow.

**Edge Cases:**

Consider edge cases such as:

*   No tasks to schedule.
*   No available machines.
*   Tasks with no dependencies.
*   Tasks with very long runtimes.
*   Machines with very limited resources.

Good luck!

## Question: Distributed Transaction Orchestration

### Project Name: `decentralized-tx-coordinator`

### Question Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a decentralized transaction coordinator for a distributed database system. This system consists of multiple independent data nodes (each responsible for a subset of the overall data) and a network of clients that initiate transactions. Your solution should ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for transactions spanning multiple data nodes *without* relying on a centralized transaction manager.

**The Challenge:**

The inherent challenge lies in coordinating the commit or rollback of a transaction across multiple nodes in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner, given the absence of a central coordinator. The system must handle node failures, network partitions, and concurrent transactions.

**Specifically:**

1.  **Data Nodes:** Each data node exposes an API with the following functions:
    *   `prepare(transaction_id, operations)`:  Attempts to tentatively apply a set of operations (`operations`) associated with the given `transaction_id`. Returns `prepared` (true/false) indicating success/failure and an optional error message. `operations` is a list of (key, value, type) tuples where type can be "write", "delete", "update".
    *   `commit(transaction_id)`:  Permanently applies the previously prepared operations for the given `transaction_id`.  Returns `success` (true/false) and an optional error message.
    *   `rollback(transaction_id)`:  Reverts any tentatively applied operations for the given `transaction_id`. Returns `success` (true/false) and an optional error message.

2.  **Clients:** Clients initiate transactions by sending a list of operations to a set of data nodes.

3.  **Your Task:** Implement a distributed transaction coordinator using the 2-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol (or a suitable alternative decentralized consensus algorithm like Paxos or Raft adapted for transaction coordination) to ensure atomicity.  Your solution should handle the following:

    *   **Atomicity:** All operations within a transaction must either commit successfully on all participating nodes or rollback on all nodes.
    *   **Consistency:** The system must maintain data consistency even in the presence of failures.
    *   **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other (consider locking mechanisms).
    *   **Durability:** Once a transaction commits, the changes must be durable even if nodes subsequently fail.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be able to recover from node failures during the prepare or commit phase.  Implement mechanisms to detect and handle failed nodes.
    *   **Concurrency:**  Design your solution to allow concurrent transactions to proceed without excessive blocking. Consider using appropriate locking mechanisms or optimistic concurrency control.
    *   **Deadlock Prevention/Detection:** Implement a strategy to prevent or detect and resolve deadlocks.

**Constraints:**

*   **Decentralization:** You *cannot* use a centralized transaction manager or coordinator. All coordination must happen directly between the data nodes or via a peer-to-peer network.
*   **Message Passing:** Nodes communicate primarily through message passing. You need to define the message formats and protocols.
*   **Network Partitions:** Your solution needs to handle network partitions gracefully.  A partitioned node might be unable to reach other nodes.
*   **Node Failures:** Your solution needs to handle node failures during any phase of the transaction.
*   **Optimization:** Minimize the number of messages exchanged between nodes to improve performance.
*   **Scalability:** Your solution should be designed to scale to a large number of data nodes.

**Implementation Details:**

*   Implement the `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` functions for the data nodes.
*   Implement the client-side transaction initiation logic, including the decentralized coordination mechanism.
*   Consider using a suitable data structure to track transaction states and participating nodes.
*   Implement a locking mechanism (e.g., row-level locking) to ensure isolation.
*   Implement a mechanism to detect and handle node failures (e.g., heartbeat mechanism).
*   Implement a timeout mechanism to handle unresponsive nodes.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a deadlock detection or prevention mechanism.
*   Implement a recovery mechanism to handle node restarts.
*   Provide a performance analysis of your solution.
*   Consider alternative consensus algorithms beyond 2PC and justify your choice.

This problem challenges you to design a robust and scalable distributed transaction system, demanding a deep understanding of distributed systems principles and fault-tolerance techniques. Good luck!

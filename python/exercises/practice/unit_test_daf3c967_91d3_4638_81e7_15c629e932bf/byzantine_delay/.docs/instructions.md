## The Byzantine Agreement Problem with Message Delay

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are building a distributed consensus system for a critical application (e.g., a decentralized finance platform, a secure voting system). This system relies on multiple nodes (participants) to agree on a single value (e.g., a transaction, a vote). However, some of these nodes might be faulty, potentially sending conflicting information, and the network communication may be unreliable.

You are tasked with implementing a simplified version of the Byzantine Agreement protocol, with a twist. Unlike the classic problem, you need to account for variable message delays between nodes.

**Formalization:**

*   **Number of Nodes:** You have `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.
*   **One Commander:** Node `0` is designated as the commander.
*   **Initial Value:** The commander starts with a value `V` (either `0` or `1`).
*   **Faulty Nodes:** Up to `F` nodes can be faulty (Byzantine). These faulty nodes can send arbitrary and potentially contradictory messages to other nodes. Assume `F < N/3` to ensure consensus is theoretically possible.
*   **Message Delays:** Messages sent between nodes are not instantaneous. Each message has a non-negative integer delay associated with it. These delays are known *a priori* to all nodes (but the content of messages remains unknown). The delays are represented by a `delay_matrix`, where `delay_matrix[i][j]` is the delay for a message sent from node `i` to node `j`.
*   **Rounds:** The protocol proceeds in `R` rounds.  In each round:

    1.  The commander (node 0) sends a value to all other nodes.
    2.  Each node (including the commander) relays the values it received in the previous round to all other nodes.
*   **Agreement:** After `R` rounds, each non-faulty node must decide on a single value (either `0` or `1`). The goal is for all non-faulty nodes to agree on the same value.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `byzantine_agreement(N, F, V, delay_matrix, R, faulty_nodes)` that simulates the Byzantine Agreement protocol with message delays.

The function should return a list of length `N`, where each element represents the final decision of the corresponding node. Faulty nodes can return any value.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Efficiency:**  The simulation needs to be efficient, especially with larger numbers of nodes and rounds. Consider efficient data structures for message storage and propagation.
*   **Robustness:** Your solution should handle various faulty node behaviors (e.g., sending different values to different nodes, not sending messages at all).
*   **Realism:** The delay matrix significantly complicates the message propagation. You must ensure that messages are only processed *after* the appropriate delay has elapsed.
*   **Byzantine Nodes:** The faulty nodes are specified in the `faulty_nodes` parameter, which is a set of node IDs.
*   **Decision Logic:** Each non-faulty node should use the majority value received after `R` rounds as its final decision. If there is a tie, the node should default to `0`.  The majority must be calculated based on the values the node *actually* received considering the delays.

**Input:**

*   `N`:  The number of nodes (integer).
*   `F`:  The maximum number of faulty nodes (integer, `F < N/3`).
*   `V`:  The commander's initial value (integer, either `0` or `1`).
*   `delay_matrix`: A list of lists representing the message delays. `delay_matrix[i][j]` is the delay for a message from node `i` to node `j` (non-negative integer).
*   `R`:  The number of rounds (integer).
*   `faulty_nodes`: A set of integers representing the IDs of the faulty nodes.

**Output:**

*   A list of integers of length `N`, representing the final decision of each node.

**Example:**

Let's say:

*   `N = 3`
*   `F = 0`
*   `V = 1`
*   `delay_matrix = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]`
*   `R = 1`
*   `faulty_nodes = set()`

In this simple case, the commander (node 0) sends the value 1 to nodes 1 and 2 with a delay of 1.  After round 1, nodes 1 and 2 both receive the value 1. They decide on 1. The commander decides on its initial value, 1.

The output would be: `[1, 1, 1]`

**This problem requires careful consideration of message passing, time management (due to delays), and decision-making in the presence of faulty nodes. It encourages the use of appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient simulation of the Byzantine Agreement protocol.**

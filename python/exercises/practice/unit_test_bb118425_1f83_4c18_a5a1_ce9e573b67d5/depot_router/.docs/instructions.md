## Question: Optimal Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Resource Constraints

### Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing the delivery routes for a logistics company operating in a large city. The company has multiple depots, each with a limited number of vehicles and a finite amount of resources (e.g., drivers, fuel). The goal is to minimize the total travel time required to serve a set of customer orders, subject to the following constraints:

*   **Multiple Depots:** The company has `N` depots located throughout the city. Each depot `i` has a fleet of `V_i` vehicles and `R_i` units of a resource (e.g. driver hours).

*   **Customer Orders:** There are `M` customer orders, each with:
    *   A specific location (latitude and longitude).
    *   A demand for a certain quantity of goods (`Q_j`).
    *   A time window (`[T_start_j, T_end_j]`) during which the delivery must be made.
    *   A service time (`S_j`) representing the time required to unload the goods at the customer's location.
    *   A depot preference list (`P_j`) which is a list of depot IDs ranked by preference (1 being highest preference). A customer *must* be serviced by a depot on their preference list.

*   **Vehicle Capacity:** Each vehicle has a maximum carrying capacity (`C`).

*   **Time Windows:** Deliveries must be made within the specified time window for each customer. If a vehicle arrives before `T_start_j`, it must wait until the time window opens.

*   **Resource Constraints:** Each vehicle route originating from depot `i` must consume no more than `R_i` resources (e.g. driver hours). Travel time and service time contribute to resource consumption.

*   **Route Duration:** Each route has a maximum allowed duration `D`.

*   **Travel Time:** Travel time between any two locations (depot or customer) is given by a pre-computed distance matrix. Assume travel time is proportional to distance, and that travel time is equal in both directions between any two locations.

*   **Objective:** Minimize the total travel time of all routes. The travel time is the sum of all the time spent driving between locations (including returning to the depot). Waiting time at customers does *not* count towards travel time.

**Input:**

Your function will receive the following inputs:

*   `depots`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a depot `(latitude, longitude, num_vehicles, resource_capacity)`.
*   `customers`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a customer order `(latitude, longitude, demand, time_window_start, time_window_end, service_time, depot_preference_list)`.
*   `distance_matrix`: A 2D array representing the travel time between any two locations (depots and customers).  The first N rows/columns represent the depots, and the subsequent M rows/columns represent the customers.
*   `vehicle_capacity`: An integer representing the maximum carrying capacity of each vehicle.
*   `max_route_duration`: An integer representing the maximum duration allowed for each route.

**Output:**

Your function must return a list of routes, where each route is represented as a list of customer indices (0-indexed relative to the `customers` list) visited by a vehicle. Each route must also indicate its originating depot index (0-indexed relative to the `depots` list).

The returned data structure should be a list of tuples: `[(depot_index, [customer_index1, customer_index2, ...]), (depot_index, [customer_index3, ...]), ...]`

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 5` (Number of depots)
*   `1 <= M <= 200` (Number of customers)
*   `1 <= V_i <= 10` (Vehicles per depot)
*   `1 <= Q_j <= C <= 50` (Demand and Vehicle Capacity)
*   `0 <= T_start_j < T_end_j <= 1440` (Time windows within a day in minutes)
*   `0 < S_j <= 60` (Service time in minutes)
*   `0 < R_i <= 720` (Resource capacity in minutes)
*   `0 < D <= 720` (Max route duration in minutes)

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should aim to minimize the total travel time.
*   Solutions should be found within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 minutes).

**Example:**

(A simplified example for illustration)

```python
depots = [(37.7749, -122.4194, 2, 480)]  # San Francisco, 2 vehicles, 480 resource capacity
customers = [(37.7833, -122.4094, 10, 60, 120, 15, [0]),  # Customer 0
             (37.7937, -122.3962, 20, 180, 240, 30, [0])]  # Customer 1
distance_matrix = [[0, 10, 15],  # Depot 0 to Depot 0, Customer 0, Customer 1
                   [10, 0, 8],   # Customer 0 to Depot 0, Customer 0, Customer 1
                   [15, 8, 0]]   # Customer 1 to Depot 0, Customer 0, Customer 1
vehicle_capacity = 30
max_route_duration = 400

# Expected output format (the actual route may vary based on the algorithm):
# [(0, [0, 1]), (0, [])] # Depot 0 has two routes, one visiting customers 0 and 1, and the second is an empty route.
```

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Correctness:** The solution must satisfy all the constraints.
2.  **Optimality:** The solution with the lowest total travel time will be preferred.
3.  **Efficiency:** The solution must be found within a reasonable time limit.

**Hints:**

*   This problem is NP-hard, so finding the absolute optimal solution might be computationally infeasible for larger instances.  Focus on developing a good heuristic or metaheuristic approach.
*   Consider using techniques like:
    *   Greedy algorithms
    *   Local search (e.g., 2-opt, 3-opt)
    *   Simulated annealing
    *   Genetic algorithms
    *   Constraint programming
*   Pay careful attention to data structures and algorithmic efficiency.
*   Start with a simplified version of the problem and gradually add complexity.
*   Thoroughly test your solution with a variety of test cases, including edge cases.

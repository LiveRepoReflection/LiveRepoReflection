Okay, here's a challenging programming problem designed to test advanced data structure knowledge, algorithmic efficiency, and real-world system design considerations.

## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Tiered Access

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service. This service will be used to protect a critical API endpoint from abuse by controlling the number of requests allowed from different clients within a given time window. The rate limiter must handle a high volume of requests, be resilient to failures, and provide tiered access based on client subscription levels.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must operate across multiple server instances to handle high throughput and provide redundancy.

2.  **Tiered Access:** Clients are assigned to different tiers (e.g., "Free", "Basic", "Premium"). Each tier has a different request limit per time window (e.g., "Free" - 10 requests/minute, "Basic" - 100 requests/minute, "Premium" - 1000 requests/minute). The tier of a client is determined by a provided `client_id`. You will need to fetch each client's tier from a remote database. The interface for doing so is provided, but you cannot modify its implementation.

3.  **Real-time Enforcement:** The rate limiter must enforce the limits in real-time, rejecting requests that exceed the allowed rate.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should continue to function correctly even if some server instances fail.

5.  **Minimal Latency:** The rate limiter should introduce minimal latency to the request processing pipeline.

6.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The rate limits for each tier should be configurable without requiring a service restart. These configurations are sourced from a remote configuration server. The interface for doing so is provided, but you cannot modify its implementation.

7.  **Logging & Monitoring:** The system must provide detailed logs and metrics for monitoring performance and detecting potential issues.

**Input:**

*   A `client_id` (string) representing the client making the request.
*   A timestamp (integer) representing the time of the request (Unix epoch seconds).

**Output:**

*   A boolean value: `True` if the request is allowed, `False` if the request is rate-limited.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of server instances can vary.
*   The number of clients can be very large (millions).
*   The request rate can be very high (thousands per second).
*   The time window for rate limiting is one minute (60 seconds).
*   The database and config interfaces are provided. Their performance characteristics should be considered, but they cannot be modified. Caching strategies are permitted.
*   You are allowed to use external libraries or frameworks, but justify your choices based on performance and scalability.
*   Assume the system has limited memory per server instance.
*   Avoid using global locks that would serialize requests.

**Provided Interfaces (Assume these exist and you cannot modify them):**

*   `get_client_tier(client_id: str) -> str`:  Fetches the tier of a given client from a remote database.  Returns a string representing the tier (e.g., "Free", "Basic", "Premium").  This function has a non-negligible latency.

*   `get_rate_limit(tier: str) -> int`: Fetches the rate limit (requests per minute) for a given tier from a remote configuration server.  Returns an integer representing the limit. This function has a non-negligible latency.

*   `log_request(client_id: str, timestamp: int, allowed: bool)`: Logs the request and whether it was allowed or rate-limited. This function is asynchronous and non-blocking.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The rate limiter must accurately enforce the rate limits for each tier.
*   Performance: The rate limiter must handle a high volume of requests with minimal latency.
*   Scalability: The rate limiter must be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing traffic.
*   Fault Tolerance: The rate limiter must be resilient to failures.
*   Code Quality: The code must be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   Justification: Provide a clear explanation of your design choices, including the data structures and algorithms used, and why they are appropriate for the given requirements and constraints. Discuss the trade-offs involved in your design.

Good luck!

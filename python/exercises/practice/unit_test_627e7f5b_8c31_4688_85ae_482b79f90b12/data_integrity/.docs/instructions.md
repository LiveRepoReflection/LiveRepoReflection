Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging, covering several complex areas:

**Project Name:** `DistributedDataIntegrity`

**Question Description:**

You are designing a distributed data storage system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each storing a shard of a very large dataset. Due to network instability and potential node failures, data corruption is a significant concern. To ensure data integrity, you need to implement a robust mechanism for detecting and correcting corrupted data blocks.

Each node `i` stores a set of data blocks.  Each data block has a unique identifier (a UUID string) and a corresponding checksum (a SHA-256 hash of the data block's contents).  These checksums are stored separately.

Your task is to implement a system that, given a set of suspected nodes, efficiently identifies and corrects corrupted data blocks across the entire system.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Data Representation:** The data is represented as follows:

    *   Each node is identified by a unique integer ID (from 0 to N-1).
    *   Each data block is identified by a UUID string.
    *   A `NodeData` object represents the data stored on a single node and consists of two dictionaries:
        *   `data_blocks: Dict[str, bytes]`: Maps UUIDs to the actual data block content (bytes).
        *   `checksums: Dict[str, str]`: Maps UUIDs to their corresponding SHA-256 checksum (hex string).

2.  **Corruption Detection:** Given a list of node IDs that are suspected of having corrupted data, identify all corrupted data blocks across all nodes in the system. A data block is considered corrupted if its checksum does not match the SHA-256 hash of its content. You need to compare checksums across all nodes to determine the correct version.  If multiple uncorrupted versions of a block exist, use the version from the node with the lowest node ID as the "correct" version. If all instances of a data block are corrupted, report it as unrecoverable.

3.  **Data Correction:** For each corrupted data block identified, replace its content with the correct version identified during the corruption detection phase. If a block is unrecoverable, leave it untouched and mark it as such.

4.  **Efficiency:** The dataset is extremely large.  Minimize data transfer between nodes. Avoid transferring the actual data block content during the checksum comparison phase unless absolutely necessary. Optimize for both time and space complexity.  Assume that the number of suspected nodes can be a significant fraction of the total number of nodes.

5.  **Concurrency:** The system should be designed to handle concurrent requests for corruption detection and correction. Implement appropriate locking mechanisms to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency.

6.  **Scalability:** The number of nodes (N) can be very large (e.g., thousands). Your solution should be scalable and avoid any single point of failure.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The total number of nodes in the system (an integer).
*   `node_data: Dict[int, NodeData]`: A dictionary mapping node IDs to their corresponding `NodeData` objects.
*   `suspected_nodes: List[int]`: A list of node IDs that are suspected of having corrupted data.

**Output:**

*   A dictionary containing the updated `NodeData` for each node after the correction process.  The returned dictionary should have the same structure as the input `node_data`.
*   A list of UUID strings representing data blocks that were detected as unrecoverable.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10000`
*   The number of data blocks per node can vary.
*   Data block sizes can be large (e.g., up to 1MB).
*   Network bandwidth is limited.
*   The function should be thread-safe.
*   The SHA-256 calculation is computationally expensive.

**Example `NodeData` Structure:**

```python
from typing import Dict, List

class NodeData:
    def __init__(self, data_blocks: Dict[str, bytes], checksums: Dict[str, str]):
        self.data_blocks = data_blocks
        self.checksums = checksums

# Example usage (not part of the solution):
node_0_data = NodeData(
    data_blocks={"block_uuid_1": b"some data", "block_uuid_2": b"other data"},
    checksums={"block_uuid_1": "checksum_1", "block_uuid_2": "checksum_2"},
)
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must accurately identify and correct corrupted data blocks.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must be optimized for both time and space complexity, minimizing data transfer and computational overhead.
*   **Concurrency:** The solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests correctly.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to a large number of nodes.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, data integrity, hashing algorithms, concurrency control, and optimization techniques.  It has several valid approaches with different trade-offs, making it a challenging and sophisticated problem. Good luck!

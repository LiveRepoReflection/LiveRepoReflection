Okay, I'm ready to set a truly challenging problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Optimal Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Dynamic Order Insertion

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient delivery system for a large e-commerce company operating in a dense urban environment. The company has multiple depots strategically located throughout the city. Each depot has a limited number of vehicles and each vehicle has a limited capacity.

The company receives orders throughout the day. Each order consists of a location (latitude and longitude), a delivery time window (earliest and latest delivery time), a size (weight or volume), and a profit associated with fulfilling the order.

The goal is to design an algorithm that dynamically assigns orders to vehicles from different depots such that the total profit is maximized while satisfying the following constraints:

1.  **Vehicle Capacity:** The total size of orders assigned to a vehicle must not exceed the vehicle's capacity.
2.  **Time Windows:** Each order must be delivered within its specified time window.
3.  **Depot Assignment:** Each vehicle must start and end its route at the depot to which it is assigned.
4.  **Route Duration:** The total duration of each vehicle route (including travel time and service time) must not exceed a maximum allowed duration.
5.  **Dynamic Order Insertion:** New orders arrive continuously throughout the day. Your algorithm must efficiently incorporate these new orders into the existing routes without significantly disrupting the already planned deliveries. The algorithm should decide whether to insert the order into an existing route, create a new route from an existing Depot, or reject the order.
6.  **Travel Time:** Travel time between locations is calculated using the Haversine formula (great-circle distance) and a fixed average speed.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

*   **Depots:** A list of depots, where each depot is represented by its ID, location (latitude, longitude), number of vehicles, vehicle capacity, and available vehicles.
*   **Existing Routes:** A list of existing routes, where each route is represented by its Vehicle ID, Depot ID, and a list of the current orders ID assigned to it with the order of the deliveries.
*   **Orders:** A stream of orders, where each order is represented by its ID, location (latitude, longitude), delivery time window (start time, end time), size, and profit.
*   **Parameters:** A set of parameters, including the vehicle speed, maximum route duration, and the simulation time horizon.

**Output:**

Your algorithm should output a list of decisions for each new order. Each decision should be one of the following:

*   `Assigned`:  If the order is assigned to an existing route or a new route. Include the Vehicle ID, and the position where the order is inserted (or last position if the order creates a new route).
*   `Rejected`: If the order cannot be feasibly assigned to any vehicle.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of depots is between 1 and 10.
*   The number of vehicles per depot is between 1 and 20.
*   The number of orders can be very large (up to 100,000).
*   The delivery time windows can vary significantly in length.
*   The computational time for processing each new order must be limited (e.g., to a few seconds).  The system should operate in near real-time.
*   All locations are within a reasonable urban area (e.g., a 50km x 50km square).
*   The vehicle capacity and order sizes are integers.
*   The time windows are represented in seconds since the start of the simulation.

**Scoring:**

The score will be based on the total profit of the delivered orders. A higher profit means a better score. A penalty will be applied for violating any of the constraints. The score will be normalized based on the performance of other participants.

**Challenge:**

This problem requires you to combine your knowledge of data structures, graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and real-time system design. You will need to develop a sophisticated algorithm that can efficiently handle the dynamic nature of the problem while optimizing for profit and satisfying all constraints. Consider using heuristics, metaheuristics (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms), or approximation algorithms to find near-optimal solutions within the time limit. Think carefully about data structures to enable fast lookups and updates.

Good luck!

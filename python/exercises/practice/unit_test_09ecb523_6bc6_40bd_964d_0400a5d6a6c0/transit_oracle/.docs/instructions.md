## Problem: Optimal Public Transit Route Finder with Real-Time Updates

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient public transit route finder. The system must be able to handle a large volume of queries in real-time, taking into account the complexities of a real-world public transit network, including:

*   **Multiple Transportation Modes:** Buses, trains, subways, and ferries, each with their own speed and cost characteristics.
*   **Transfer Penalties:** Time penalties (waiting time) for transferring between different modes of transportation or even different lines within the same mode.
*   **Real-Time Delays:** The system must incorporate real-time updates on delays for each transportation line (e.g., a train is 15 minutes behind schedule).
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Fares can vary based on the time of day, day of the week, and the distance traveled.
*   **Capacity Constraints:** While you don't have to simulate individual passengers, you need to approximate the impact of high traffic times. Routes that use frequently overloaded lines during peak hours should be penalized.

**Input:**

*   A static dataset describing the public transit network:
    *   Stations/Stops with geographical coordinates.
    *   Lines (e.g., Bus Route 22, Train Line A) connecting stations.
    *   Transportation modes for each line.
    *   Scheduled travel times between stations for each line.
    *   Transfer stations where users can switch between lines/modes, including the transfer time penalty.
    *   Pricing rules (time of day, day of week, distance).
    *   Typical peak usage times for each line.

*   Real-time updates:
    *   Delay information for each line (in minutes).
    *   Potentially, updates to pricing rules (e.g., surge pricing).

*   A user query:
    *   Start location (latitude, longitude).
    *   End location (latitude, longitude).
    *   Departure time (timestamp).

**Output:**

*   An ordered list of route options, ranked by a cost function that considers:
    *   Travel time (including transfer penalties and real-time delays).
    *   Monetary cost (fare).
    *   "Comfort" (penalty for using lines known to be heavily congested at the departure time).
*   Each route option should include:
    *   A sequence of stations/stops.
    *   The lines used for each segment of the route.
    *   Estimated travel time for each segment.
    *   Estimated fare for each segment.
    *   Total travel time.
    *   Total fare.
    *   Total "comfort" score.

**Constraints:**

*   **Performance:** The system must respond to queries within a reasonable time (e.g., under 5 seconds for a typical query). This implies a need for efficient algorithms and data structures.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of stations, lines, and concurrent queries.
*   **Accuracy:** The estimated travel times and fares should be as accurate as possible, given the available data and real-time updates.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The system must be able to incorporate real-time updates quickly and efficiently without significantly impacting query performance.
*   **Memory Usage:**  The memory footprint of the system should be optimized to handle large transit networks.

**Specifically, your implementation should consider these challenges:**

*   **Data Representation:** Choosing appropriate data structures to represent the transit network (e.g., graph-based representations).
*   **Route Finding Algorithm:** Selecting and implementing a suitable route-finding algorithm (e.g., A*, Dijkstra's algorithm, or more advanced techniques like Contraction Hierarchies) that can handle multiple criteria (time, cost, comfort).
*   **Real-Time Updates Handling:** Designing a mechanism to efficiently update the network representation with real-time delay information and dynamic pricing.  Consider how to minimize the impact of updates on ongoing route calculations.
*   **Optimization:** Optimizing the route-finding algorithm and data structures to meet the performance requirements.
*   **Handling Capacity Constraints:**  Developing a heuristic or model to estimate and penalize routes that use congested lines during peak hours. This could involve analyzing historical data or using real-time ridership information (if available).

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, data structure expertise, and system design considerations to create a robust and efficient public transit route finder. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization requirements, and a real-world-inspired scenario:

## Problem Title: Optimal Multi-Commodity Flow Allocation

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient allocation strategy for a multi-commodity flow network.  Imagine a complex distribution system (e.g., a logistics network, a data center network) where various types of goods (commodities) need to be transported from their respective sources to their destinations through a shared network infrastructure.

The network is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent locations and edges represent transportation links with limited capacities.  Each commodity has a specific source node, a destination node, and a demand (the amount of that commodity that needs to be transported).

Your goal is to determine the optimal flow allocation for each commodity such that:

1.  **All demands are satisfied.**  Every commodity must have its entire demand transported from its source to its destination.
2.  **Edge capacities are not exceeded.**  For each edge in the network, the sum of the flows of all commodities passing through that edge must not exceed the edge's capacity.
3.  **Total cost is minimized.** Each edge has an associated cost per unit of flow. The total cost is the sum of (flow \* cost) for each edge across all commodities.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

*   `num_nodes`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the network (nodes are numbered 0 to `num_nodes - 1`).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents an edge in the network.  Each tuple has the form `(source_node, destination_node, capacity, cost)`.
*   `commodities`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a commodity. Each tuple has the form `(source_node, destination_node, demand)`.

**Output:**

Your function should return a dictionary where the keys are edges represented as tuples `(source_node, destination_node)` and the values are dictionaries representing the flow allocated to each commodity on that edge. The inner dictionary's keys are commodity indices (0-based), and the values are the flow amount for that commodity on that edge.

If no feasible solution exists (i.e., it's impossible to satisfy all demands without exceeding edge capacities), return `None`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_nodes <= 100`
*   `1 <= len(edges) <= 500`
*   `1 <= len(commodities) <= 20`
*   `1 <= capacity <= 1000` for each edge.
*   `1 <= cost <= 100` for each edge.
*   `1 <= demand <= 500` for each commodity.
*   The graph may not be complete.
*   There may be multiple edges between two nodes.
*   The graph may contain cycles.

**Example:**

```python
num_nodes = 4
edges = [
    (0, 1, 10, 1), # Source, Destination, Capacity, Cost
    (0, 2, 5, 2),
    (1, 2, 15, 1),
    (1, 3, 8, 3),
    (2, 3, 10, 1)
]
commodities = [
    (0, 3, 7), # Source, Destination, Demand
    (0, 3, 3)
]
```

A possible (but not necessarily optimal) solution format:

```python
{
    (0, 1): {0: 5, 1: 2},
    (0, 2): {0: 2, 1: 1},
    (1, 2): {0: 5, 1: 0},
    (1, 3): {0: 0, 1: 2},
    (2, 3): {0: 2, 1: 1}
}
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Your solution must correctly allocate flows to satisfy demands and respect edge capacities.
*   Optimality: Your solution will be evaluated based on the total cost of the flow allocation.  Solutions with lower costs will receive higher scores.
*   Efficiency: Your code must run within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few minutes).  Inefficient solutions will time out.

**Hints and Considerations:**

*   This problem can be modeled as a Linear Programming (LP) problem.  Consider using a library like `scipy.optimize.linprog` or similar to solve the LP.
*   Be careful about edge cases: What happens if there's no path between a source and destination? What if the demand is larger than the total capacity of all paths between the source and destination?
*   Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., dictionaries, adjacency lists) to represent the network and flow allocations efficiently.
*   Think about how to handle multiple commodities simultaneously in your LP formulation.
*   The number of variables in the LP can grow quickly, so optimize your formulation.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, linear programming, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

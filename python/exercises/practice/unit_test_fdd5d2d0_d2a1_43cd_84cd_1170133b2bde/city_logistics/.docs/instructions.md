## Question: Optimized Inter-City Logistics Network

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and optimizing a logistics network for a national delivery company operating across a country with numerous cities and complex transportation routes.  The company needs to efficiently deliver packages from various source cities to destination cities, minimizing overall delivery time and cost.

The transportation network is represented as a directed, weighted graph. Each city is a node in the graph, and each directed edge represents a transportation route between two cities. The weight of each edge represents the time (in hours) and cost (in a currency unit) required to traverse that route.  Multiple routes may exist between any two cities.

The company receives a large number of delivery requests daily, each specifying a source city, a destination city, a package size (in cubic meters), and a delivery deadline (in hours from the time the request is received).

Your task is to implement a system that efficiently determines the optimal route for each delivery request, considering both time and cost constraints.  The system must also handle a large volume of requests concurrently and adapt to real-time changes in the network (e.g., road closures, traffic delays).

**Constraints:**

*   **Graph Size:** The network can contain up to 10,000 cities and 50,000 routes.
*   **Request Volume:** The system must handle up to 10,000 concurrent delivery requests.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The system must be able to incorporate real-time updates to edge weights (time and cost) in the graph, which may occur frequently (e.g., every minute).
*   **Optimization Criteria:** The primary optimization goal is to minimize the total delivery cost, but the delivery must also meet the deadline. If multiple routes meet the deadline, the route with the lowest cost should be selected. If no route meets the deadline, the request should be rejected.
*   **Package Size Impact:** The package size impacts the cost per unit of time.  Specifically, for each unit of time spent traveling, the cost increases linearly with the package size.
*   **Memory Limit:** The system must operate within a reasonable memory limit (e.g., 2GB).
*   **Time Limit:** Each delivery request must be processed within a short time window (e.g., 1 second).
*   **Dynamic Cost:** The cost of edges may also change over time depending on external factors such as traffic or weather.

**Input:**

1.  **Initial Network Graph:** A description of the transportation network, including the cities (nodes), routes (edges), and associated time and cost for each route.
2.  **Delivery Requests:** A stream of delivery requests, each including:
    *   Source City ID
    *   Destination City ID
    *   Package Size (cubic meters)
    *   Delivery Deadline (hours)
3.  **Real-time Updates:** A stream of updates to the edge weights (time and cost) for specific routes.

**Output:**

For each delivery request, output either:

*   The optimal route (a list of city IDs representing the path) and the total cost.
*   A message indicating that no route meets the deadline.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:** The accuracy of the computed optimal routes and costs.
*   **Efficiency:** The speed of processing delivery requests and handling real-time updates.
*   **Scalability:** The ability to handle a large number of cities, routes, and delivery requests.
*   **Memory Usage:** The amount of memory used by your solution.
*   **Robustness:** The ability to handle edge cases and invalid input.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles to achieve optimal performance.  Good luck!

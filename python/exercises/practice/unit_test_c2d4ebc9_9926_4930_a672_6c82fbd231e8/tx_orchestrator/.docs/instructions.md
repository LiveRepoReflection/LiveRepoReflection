Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithm optimization, and real-world considerations.

## Question: Distributed Transaction Orchestration

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a system where multiple independent services (e.g., `InventoryService`, `PaymentService`, `ShippingService`) need to participate in a single, atomic transaction.  If any service fails to complete its part of the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participating services.

**The Challenge:**

Your goal is to implement a `TransactionCoordinator` class that manages these distributed transactions.  Each service exposes two primary operations: `prepare()` and `commit()`.  The `prepare()` operation attempts to tentatively execute the service's part of the transaction. If it succeeds, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The `commit()` operation finalizes the service's changes permanently. Each service also has a `rollback()` operation to revert any tentative changes made during the `prepare()` phase.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Atomicity:**  The transaction coordinator *must* ensure atomicity. Either all participating services successfully commit their changes, or all services roll back their changes.

2.  **Concurrency:**  Multiple transactions can be initiated concurrently.  The coordinator must handle concurrent transactions safely.

3.  **Idempotency:**  The `commit()` and `rollback()` operations on individual services should be idempotent. This means that calling them multiple times with the same transaction ID should have the same effect as calling them once. This is crucial for handling potential network issues and retries.

4.  **Service Discovery:** Assume a simple service discovery mechanism is provided.  You'll be given a list of service endpoints at the start of each transaction. Each service endpoint exposes `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods.

5.  **Timeout:**  The coordinator should implement a timeout mechanism. If any service takes too long to respond during the `prepare()` or `commit()` phase, the transaction should be aborted and rolled back for all participating services.

6.  **Error Handling:**  The coordinator must gracefully handle service failures (e.g., network errors, exceptions during `prepare()`, `commit()`, or `rollback()`).

7.  **Optimistic Concurrency:** Design the coordinator with optimistic concurrency in mind. Try to minimize locking and blocking.

8.  **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement a fully distributed system, consider the scalability implications of your design. How could your coordinator be scaled horizontally to handle a larger number of concurrent transactions?

**Input:**

*   A list of service endpoints (each with `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods).
*   A unique transaction ID (you can assume this is generated externally).
*   A timeout value (in seconds) for each service operation.

**Output:**

*   Return `True` if the transaction was successfully committed across all services.
*   Return `False` if the transaction was aborted and rolled back.

**Example Service Interface (Conceptual):**

```python
class ServiceInterface:
    def prepare(self, transaction_id: str) -> bool:
        """Attempts to prepare the service for the transaction.
        Returns True if prepared successfully, False otherwise."""
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def commit(self, transaction_id: str) -> None:
        """Commits the transaction."""
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def rollback(self, transaction_id: str) -> None:
        """Rolls back the transaction."""
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   Think about how you'll track the state of each transaction.
*   Consider using asynchronous programming (e.g., `asyncio`) to handle concurrent service calls efficiently.
*   Focus on correctness, robustness, and scalability.
*   Clearly document your design choices and trade-offs.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, error handling, and careful algorithm design. Good luck!

## Question: Real-Time Collaborative Document Editing with Operational Transformation

### Question Description:

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, real-time collaborative document editing system. Multiple users can simultaneously edit the same document. To maintain consistency across all clients in the face of concurrent edits, you will implement a simplified version of *Operational Transformation (OT)*.

The document is represented as a string.  An *operation* is a single atomic change to the document.  For this problem, there are two types of operations:

1.  **Insert(position, text):** Inserts the given `text` at the specified `position` in the document. `position` is an integer representing the index where the text should be inserted.
2.  **Delete(position, length):** Deletes `length` characters from the document starting at the given `position`.

Your task is to implement a function `transform_operation(local_operation, remote_operation)` that takes two operations as input: `local_operation` (the operation generated by the current user's client) and `remote_operation` (an operation received from another user's client). The function must return a *transformed* version of the `local_operation`. The transformation ensures that the `local_operation` will be correctly applied to the document *after* the `remote_operation` has already been applied, maintaining consistency.

**Details and Constraints:**

*   **Operations are applied sequentially.**  The transformation process assumes that the `remote_operation` has already been applied to the document. You are transforming the `local_operation` to account for this.
*   **Positions are 0-indexed.**
*   **Error Handling:** You do *not* need to explicitly handle invalid operations (e.g., deleting beyond the bounds of the document). Assume the input operations are well-formed and potentially based on the current document state before the remote operation.
*   **Efficiency:** While not the primary focus, strive for reasonably efficient code.  Avoid unnecessary computations or data copies.
*   **String Immutability:** In Python, strings are immutable.  Consider how to efficiently manipulate the document content without excessive string concatenation.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases such as:
    *   Inserting/deleting at the beginning/end of the document.
    *   Overlapping insert/delete operations.
    *   Inserting/deleting zero characters (valid operations).
*   **Simplifications:**
    *   You do *not* need to implement the application of operations to the document.  You are only implementing the transformation logic.
    *   You do *not* need to handle conflicts where both operations affect the same positions *simultaneously*. The operations will be processed sequentially by the server.

**Input:**

*   `local_operation`: A tuple representing the local operation. The first element is a string indicating the operation type ("insert" or "delete"). The remaining elements depend on the operation type.
    *   Insert: `("insert", position, text)`
    *   Delete: `("delete", position, length)`
*   `remote_operation`: A tuple representing the remote operation, in the same format as `local_operation`.

**Output:**

*   A tuple representing the *transformed* `local_operation`, in the same format as the input operations.

**Example:**

Let's say the document is initially "abc".

*   `local_operation`: `("insert", 1, "X")`  (Current user inserts "X" at index 1, intending "aXbc")
*   `remote_operation`: `("insert", 0, "Y")` (Another user inserts "Y" at index 0, resulting in "Yabc")

The `transform_operation` function should return `("insert", 2, "X")` (because after "Y" is inserted at the beginning, the correct position for the local user's insertion is now index 2, resulting in "YaXbc").

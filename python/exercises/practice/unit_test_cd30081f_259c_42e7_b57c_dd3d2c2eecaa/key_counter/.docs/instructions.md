`DistributedKeyCounter`

## Question Description

You are building a distributed key-value store where multiple clients can increment counters associated with different keys. Your task is to design and implement a system that efficiently manages these counters, ensuring strong consistency and fault tolerance.

Specifically, you need to implement a `DistributedKeyCounter` class with the following functionalities:

1.  **`increment(key: str, value: int) -> None`**: Increments the counter associated with the given `key` by `value`. This operation must be atomic and consistent across all nodes in the distributed system.
2.  **`get_value(key: str) -> int`**: Retrieves the current value of the counter associated with the given `key`. If the key doesn't exist, it should return 0. The returned value must reflect the most up-to-date value across all nodes.
3.  **`merge(other: DistributedKeyCounter) -> None`**: Merges another `DistributedKeyCounter` into the current one.  This operation should correctly handle concurrent increments.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Distributed System:** Assume the `DistributedKeyCounter` instances are running on different nodes in a distributed system. Communication between nodes is possible but potentially unreliable (message loss, network partitions).
*   **Strong Consistency:** All nodes must eventually agree on the same value for each key.  Implement a mechanism to prevent race conditions and data loss.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to handle node failures gracefully. Implement a mechanism to recover from failures and ensure data availability.
*   **Concurrency:** Multiple clients can concurrently increment counters associated with the same key. Your implementation must handle concurrent increments correctly.
*   **Optimization:** Consider the performance implications of your design. Strive for low latency and high throughput.
*   **Scalability:** Your design should be scalable to a large number of keys and nodes.
*   **Data Structure Choice:** The choice of data structure to store the keys and values is up to you, but you should justify your choice based on performance and scalability considerations. Consider both memory usage and access time.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Your `merge` operation needs to handle the possibility of conflicting increment operations on the same key in different `DistributedKeyCounter` instances. You need to design a robust conflict resolution strategy. Consider scenarios where the same key is incremented multiple times in both `DistributedKeyCounter` instances before they are merged.
*   **At-Least-Once Semantics for Increment:** Due to potential network issues, the `increment` operation should ensure at-least-once semantics. This means that an increment might be applied multiple times, but it should never be lost. Design your merge operation to gracefully handle duplicate increments without corrupting the counter values.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and resolving network partitions.
*   Implement a mechanism for handling clock skew between nodes.

This problem requires careful consideration of distributed systems concepts and trade-offs. There is no single "correct" solution, and the best approach will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the system. Your code should be well-structured, documented, and tested to ensure correctness and robustness.

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focusing on both algorithmic thinking and system design considerations.

### Project Name

`ScalableLogAggregation`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for aggregating logs from a large number of distributed services.  Each service generates logs in a continuous stream. Your system needs to efficiently collect, process, and store these logs, allowing for real-time querying and analysis.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**  Simulate log data coming from `N` different services (where `N` can be on the order of 10,000 or more). Each service produces log entries at a variable rate, ranging from 10 logs/second to 1000 logs/second.  A log entry is a simple string message.

2.  **Log Aggregation:** Design a mechanism to collect logs from all services efficiently.  Consider using a message queue (like Redis Pub/Sub, Kafka, or a similar technology â€“ *you don't need to actually implement the message queue, but your design should acknowledge its existence and role*), or some kind of push/pull mechanism.

3.  **Real-time Processing:**  As logs are ingested, your system must maintain a real-time count of the occurrences of specific keywords. You will be given a list of `K` keywords (where `K` can be on the order of 100-1000), and you need to track how many times each keyword appears in the logs within a sliding time window of `W` seconds (where `W` can be between 60 and 600). Assume keyword matching is case-insensitive.

4.  **Storage:** Design a storage solution for the raw log data.  You need to be able to retrieve logs for a specific service within a specific time range.  Consider the trade-offs between storage cost, retrieval speed, and data durability. (Again, you don't need to implement the storage system, but you should justify your choice and discuss alternatives).

5.  **Querying:** Implement a query interface that allows users to:
    *   Retrieve all log entries for a specific service within a specified time range (start and end timestamps).
    *   Retrieve the real-time count of occurrences for a specific keyword within the current time window.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:**  Your solution must be able to handle a large volume of log data (potentially millions of log entries per minute).  Consider horizontal scalability and distributed processing.
*   **Latency:**  Query responses should be returned as quickly as possible. Strive for low latency, especially for real-time keyword counts.
*   **Resource Efficiency:**  Minimize CPU and memory usage.  Optimize data structures and algorithms for efficiency.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Consider how your system would handle failures of individual services or components.  Design for resilience.
*   **Concurrency:** The system must handle multiple concurrent queries efficiently. Use appropriate locking or concurrency control mechanisms.
*   **Time Complexity:** Pay attention to the time complexity of your algorithms, especially for real-time keyword counting and log retrieval.  Aim for optimal performance.
*   **Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures (e.g., trees, graphs, heaps, hashmaps) to optimize performance.
*   **Optimization**: The sliding window keyword count needs to be optimized. A naive approach will result in time limit exceeded.

**Input:**

*   `N`: Number of services (integer).
*   `K`: List of keywords (list of strings).
*   `W`: Time window in seconds (integer).
*   A stream of log entries from each of the `N` services, along with a timestamp.  The log entries are provided as strings.
*   A series of queries, which can be either:
    *   `GetLogs(service_id, start_timestamp, end_timestamp)`
    *   `GetKeywordCount(keyword)`

**Output:**

*   For `GetLogs` queries, return a list of log entries for the specified service and time range.
*   For `GetKeywordCount` queries, return the current count of the specified keyword within the sliding time window.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  The system must return accurate results for all queries.
*   **Efficiency:**  The system must be able to handle a large volume of log data with low latency.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be designed to scale horizontally.
*   **Code Quality:**  The code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Design Rationale:** You need to justify your design choices and explain the trade-offs you made.
*   **Optimizations**: Is the sliding window keyword count algorithm optimized?

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic skills, system design knowledge, and an understanding of real-world constraints.  Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, real-world scenarios, and efficiency considerations.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkPlacement`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and optimizing the placement of content delivery network (CDN) servers across a country represented as a weighted graph. The graph's nodes represent cities, and the edges represent communication links between them. The weight of each edge represents the latency of the link.

Given the following inputs:

1.  **`cities`**: An integer representing the number of cities in the country, numbered from 0 to `cities - 1`.
2.  **`connections`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(city1, city2, latency)` represents a bidirectional communication link between `city1` and `city2` with the given `latency`.
3.  **`demand`**: A list of integers, where `demand[i]` represents the data demand of city `i`.
4.  **`cdn_capacity`**: An integer representing the data serving capacity of a single CDN server.
5.  **`cdn_cost`**: An integer representing the cost of deploying a single CDN server.
6.  **`latency_tolerance`**: An integer representing the maximum acceptable latency between a city and its nearest CDN server.
7. **`candidate_sites`**: A list of integers. These are cities that can host CDN servers. CDN servers can **only** be placed in cities that are in this list.

Your goal is to determine the *minimum total cost* to place CDN servers such that:

*   **All demand is met:** The sum of `cdn_capacity` of CDN servers is greater than or equal to the sum of `demand`. Each city's demand must be fully satisfied.
*   **Latency constraint is satisfied:** For each city, there must be at least one CDN server within `latency_tolerance` latency.

The cost is calculated as: `Number of CDN servers deployed * cdn_cost`.

**Constraints:**

*   Your solution should be efficient for a large number of cities (up to 1000), connections (up to 5000), and a reasonable number of candidate locations.
*   The latency is non-negative.
*   The demand is non-negative.
*   It is guaranteed that there will be at least one candidate city.
*   If it's impossible to satisfy all constraints return `-1`.

**Example:**

```
cities = 5
connections = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 15), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 12), (2, 4, 20), (3, 4, 8)]
demand = [20, 30, 25, 15, 10]
cdn_capacity = 50
cdn_cost = 100
latency_tolerance = 20
candidate_sites = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, you need to find the optimal placement of CDN servers in cities 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to minimize the cost while meeting the demand and latency constraints.

**Hints (To consider when implementing your solution):**

*   Consider using graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm) to calculate the latency between cities.
*   Think about optimization techniques (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or binary search) to find the minimum cost placement.
*   Carefully handle edge cases, such as disconnected graphs or scenarios where the CDN capacity is insufficient.
*   Consider a good way to represent the graph.
*   Consider the time complexity of your algorithm. Aim for a solution better than O(n^2 * k), where n is the number of cities and k is the number of candidate sites.

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging problem designed to test a range of skills.

## Problem: Distributed Key-Value Store with Eventual Consistency

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed key-value store with eventual consistency. The store comprises several nodes, each holding a subset of the data. Due to network partitions and other failures, data may become inconsistent across the nodes temporarily, but should eventually converge to a consistent state.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **`put(key, value, timestamp)`:** Stores a key-value pair with an associated timestamp. The timestamp represents the time the data was written. If a node already has a value for the given key, it should compare the timestamp of the new value with the existing one.  If the new timestamp is more recent, overwrite the existing value. If the timestamps are equal, the new value overwrites the existing value. If the new timestamp is older, the existing value is kept.

2.  **`get(key)`:** Retrieves the most recent value associated with a given key, based on the timestamp. If the key is not found on a node, return `None`.

3.  **`reconcile(other_node)`:** Synchronizes data between two nodes. This involves exchanging key-value pairs and their associated timestamps. After reconciliation, each node should contain the most recent version (based on timestamps) of all keys present in either node *before* the reconcile operation.  This operation must be efficient, avoiding unnecessary data transfer.

**Constraints:**

*   **Eventual Consistency:** Your system must eventually converge to a consistent state, meaning that after a period of inactivity (no new writes), all nodes should have the same, most recent data.
*   **Timestamp Resolution:** Timestamps are integers. Larger integers represent more recent timestamps.
*   **Key and Value Types:** Both keys and values are strings.
*   **Number of Nodes:** The system will consist of a variable number of nodes. Your implementation needs to be able to handle at least 10 nodes.
*   **Network Partitions:** Assume that network partitions can occur.  Nodes may temporarily be unable to communicate with each other. Your reconciliation process should be able to handle these scenarios when connectivity is restored.
*   **Efficiency:** The `reconcile` operation should be optimized to minimize the amount of data transferred between nodes. Avoid sending data that the other node already has a more recent version of.
*   **Scalability:** Consider how your design could be scaled to handle a large number of keys and nodes. (This is more of a design consideration, but it should influence your choice of data structures and algorithms).

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism to detect and resolve conflicts when multiple nodes have different values for the same key with the same timestamp. Define a deterministic conflict resolution strategy (e.g., lexicographical order of values).
*   Implement a "hinted handoff" mechanism, where a node temporarily stores data intended for another node that is currently unavailable, and delivers the data when the other node comes back online.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. Good luck!

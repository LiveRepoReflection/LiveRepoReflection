## Question: Optimized Social Network Connectivity Analysis

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a system to analyze connectivity in a rapidly growing social network. The network consists of `N` users, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. Initially, no users are connected. Users can become connected through "friend requests". A friend request from user `A` to user `B` establishes a connection between them, making them friends. Friendship is bidirectional: if `A` is friends with `B`, then `B` is friends with `A`.

The system needs to efficiently handle the following operations:

1.  **`connect(user1, user2)`:** Establishes a friendship between `user1` and `user2`.

2.  **`are_connected(user1, user2)`:** Returns `True` if `user1` and `user2` are connected (directly or indirectly through other friends), and `False` otherwise.

3.  **`largest_component_size()`:** Returns the size of the largest connected component in the social network. A connected component is a group of users who are all reachable from each other.

4.  **`min_connections_to_separate(user1, user2)`:** Determine minimum number of connections need to break, to separate two users completely from each other. If two users are not connected, return 0;

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10^5` (Maximum number of users)
*   The number of `connect` operations can be up to `10^5`.
*   The number of `are_connected` operations can be up to `10^5`.
*   The number of `largest_component_size` operations can be up to `10^3`.
*   The number of `min_connections_to_separate` operations can be up to `10^3`.
*   `0 <= user1, user2 < N`
*   The system should be optimized for both time and space complexity.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The `connect` and `are_connected` operations should have an average time complexity of close to `O(1)`.
*   The `largest_component_size` operation should be efficient, even when the network is densely connected.
*   The `min_connections_to_separate` operations should have an average time complexity of close to `O(n log n)`.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   Handle cases where `user1` and `user2` are the same.
*   Ensure the system correctly handles cycles in the network.
*   Consider the memory footprint of your data structures, especially with a large number of users.

This problem requires careful selection of data structures and algorithms to meet the performance requirements, making it a challenging task. Consider using a combination of techniques to optimize different aspects of the system.

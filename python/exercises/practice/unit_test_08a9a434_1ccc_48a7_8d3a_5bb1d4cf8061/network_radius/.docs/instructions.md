## Question: Optimal Wireless Network Placement

**Scenario:**

You are tasked with designing the optimal wireless network infrastructure for a large, sprawling university campus. The campus consists of `N` buildings, represented as points on a 2D plane. Each building *must* have wireless coverage. You have a limited budget to purchase and install wireless access points (APs).

**Problem:**

Given the coordinates of `N` buildings on the campus and a fixed number `K` of wireless access points (APs) you can deploy, determine the *minimum* transmission radius, `R`, required for each AP such that *every* building is covered by at least one AP.

**Constraints and Assumptions:**

*   Each AP has the same transmission radius, `R`.
*   Buildings are represented by their (x, y) coordinates as integers.
*   AP locations can be placed *anywhere* on the 2D plane, they do not need to be at building locations.
*   A building is considered covered by an AP if the Euclidean distance between the building and the AP is less than or equal to `R`.
*   `1 <= N <= 200` (number of buildings)
*   `1 <= K <= 20` (number of APs)
*   `-10^4 <= x, y <= 10^4` (building coordinates)
*   The solution (minimum `R`) must be accurate to within `10^-5`.
*   The total number of buildings and APs may exceed available memory if intermediate data structures are naively constructed.
*   Efficiency is paramount. Solutions with high time complexities will likely time out.

**Input:**

*   `buildings`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a building. For example: `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]`.
*   `K`: An integer representing the maximum number of wireless access points (APs) that can be placed.

**Output:**

*   A float representing the minimum required transmission radius, `R`.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Correctness:** Does it always produce the correct minimum radius?
2.  **Accuracy:** Is the result accurate to within the specified tolerance?
3.  **Efficiency:** How quickly does it solve the problem, especially for larger inputs?
4.  **Code Clarity:** Is the code well-structured and easy to understand?

**Hint:** Think about how to combine geometric concepts with algorithmic techniques to solve this problem efficiently. Consider binary search and optimization techniques to manage the search space. Also, think about how to cleverly find the optimal placement of the APs for a given radius.

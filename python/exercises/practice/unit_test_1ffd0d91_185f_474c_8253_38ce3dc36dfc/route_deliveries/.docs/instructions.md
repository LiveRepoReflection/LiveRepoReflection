Okay, here is a challenging coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world applicability.

**Problem Title:**  Optimal Multi-Hop Route Planning

**Problem Description:**

You are given a large-scale logistics network represented as a directed graph.  The nodes in the graph represent distribution centers, and the edges represent transportation routes between them. Each edge has an associated cost representing the time (in hours) it takes to travel that route.

Specifically:

*   The graph is represented as an adjacency list where `graph[i]` is a list of tuples `(j, cost)`, meaning there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `j` with a cost of `cost`. Assume all nodes are 0-indexed.
*   You are also given a list of packages that need to be delivered from their respective origin centers to their destination centers. Each package is represented as a tuple `(origin, destination, deadline)`. The `deadline` represents the maximum time (in hours) allowed for the package to reach its destination.

Your task is to find the *maximum* number of packages that can be delivered on time, given the logistics network. You can deliver packages independently.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

1.  The graph can be very large (up to 10,000 nodes and 50,000 edges).
2.  The number of packages can also be large (up to 5,000).
3.  The cost of each edge is a positive integer.
4.  Deadlines are positive integers.
5.  There might not be a path between the origin and destination for a package. In this case, the package cannot be delivered.
6.  There might be multiple paths between the origin and destination. You need to find the shortest path to determine if the package can be delivered on time.
7.  Delivering a package does not affect the state of the network or the possibility of delivering other packages.
8.  The graph may contain cycles.
9.  The graph is not necessarily connected.
10. The graph is directed, meaning transportation from A to B does not guarantee transportation from B to A.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the large input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., several seconds).  Brute-force approaches that explore all possible subsets of packages will likely time out.
*   Consider the time complexity of your shortest path algorithm.
*   Think about how to avoid redundant computations.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    0: [(1, 5), (2, 3)],
    1: [(3, 6)],
    2: [(1, 2), (3, 4)],
    3: []
}

packages = [
    (0, 3, 12),  # Origin 0, Destination 3, Deadline 12
    (2, 3, 6),   # Origin 2, Destination 3, Deadline 6
    (0, 1, 6)    # Origin 0, Destination 1, Deadline 6
]

# Expected output: 3 (all packages can be delivered on time)
```

**Real-World Considerations:**

This problem models a simplified version of real-world route planning challenges faced by logistics companies like Amazon, FedEx, and UPS. Optimizing package delivery is crucial for minimizing costs and meeting customer expectations.

**Good luck!**

Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Distributed Task Scheduler with Resource Constraints**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed task scheduler for a high-performance computing cluster. The cluster consists of `N` worker nodes, each with varying computational resources (CPU cores, memory, and disk space). You are given a set of `M` independent tasks, each with its own resource requirements and a deadline.

Your scheduler must efficiently assign tasks to worker nodes to minimize the overall makespan (the time when the last task finishes). However, the problem is complicated by network bandwidth limitations between nodes. Transferring large datasets required by a task from one node to another incurs a time penalty proportional to the data size and inversely proportional to the network bandwidth between the nodes.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

1.  **Number of worker nodes (N):** An integer representing the number of worker nodes in the cluster.
2.  **Worker node resources:** A list of `N` tuples, where each tuple represents the resources of a worker node in the format `(CPU, Memory, Disk)`. `CPU` is the number of CPU cores, `Memory` is the available memory in GB, and `Disk` is the available disk space in GB.
3.  **Number of tasks (M):** An integer representing the number of tasks to be scheduled.
4.  **Task requirements:** A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple represents the resource requirements and deadline of a task in the format `(CPU, Memory, Disk, DataSize, Deadline)`. `CPU` is the number of CPU cores required, `Memory` is the memory required in GB, `Disk` is the disk space required in GB, `DataSize` is the size of the input data in GB, and `Deadline` is the deadline for task completion (represented as an integer timestamp).
5.  **Network bandwidth matrix:** An `N x N` matrix representing the network bandwidth between each pair of worker nodes. `bandwidth[i][j]` represents the bandwidth in GB/s between worker node `i` and worker node `j`.  `bandwidth[i][i]` should be a large number (effectively infinity) representing zero transfer time when a task runs on the node containing the data.  The matrix is symmetric (i.e., `bandwidth[i][j] == bandwidth[j][i]`).
6.  **Task execution times:** A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple represents the execution time of each task on each node. `execution_times[i][j]` represents the execution time (in seconds) of the i-th task on the j-th node.

**Output:**

Your code should output a schedule, which is a list of `M` integers. Each integer represents the worker node to which the corresponding task is assigned (0-indexed).

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 20
*   1 <= M <= 100
*   CPU, Memory, Disk, DataSize, and Deadline are positive integers.
*   Reasonable ranges for resource values will be provided in test cases.
*   Bandwidth values are positive real numbers.
*   Task execution times are positive real numbers.
*   All tasks are independent and can be executed in any order.
*   A task must be assigned to a single worker node.
*   The resource requirements of a task must not exceed the available resources of the assigned worker node.
*   All tasks must complete before their deadlines.
*   The goal is to minimize the makespan (the time when the last task finishes).

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** The solution must produce a valid schedule that satisfies all the constraints.
2.  **Makespan:** The solution with the smallest makespan will receive the highest score. Partial credit will be given for solutions with reasonable makespans.
3.  **Efficiency:** Your code should be efficient enough to handle the given input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 seconds).

**Example:** (Simplified to illustrate the input format)

```
N = 2
Worker Resources = [(4, 8, 10), (8, 16, 20)]  # (CPU, Memory, Disk)
M = 3
Task Requirements = [(2, 4, 5, 2, 100), (1, 2, 3, 1, 120), (3, 6, 7, 3, 150)] # (CPU, Memory, Disk, DataSize, Deadline)
Network Bandwidth = [[100000, 1], [1, 100000]]
Task Execution Times = [[10, 12], [15, 13], [20, 18]]
```

In this example, there are two worker nodes and three tasks. The first worker node has 4 CPU cores, 8 GB of memory, and 10 GB of disk space. The first task requires 2 CPU cores, 4 GB of memory, 5 GB of disk space, has a data size of 2 GB, and a deadline of 100.  The network bandwidth between the worker nodes is 1 GB/s. The first task takes 10 seconds to execute on the first node and 12 seconds to execute on the second node.

**Challenge:**

This problem requires careful consideration of resource allocation, network communication overhead, and task scheduling. Effective solutions might involve heuristics, approximation algorithms, or metaheuristic optimization techniques.  Consider that simply assigning tasks greedily based on individual task deadlines will likely not yield optimal results due to the complex interdependencies of resource constraints and network communication.

This setup encourages a wide range of approaches, from simpler heuristics to more sophisticated optimization algorithms, allowing contestants to demonstrate their problem-solving skills and algorithmic knowledge. Good luck!

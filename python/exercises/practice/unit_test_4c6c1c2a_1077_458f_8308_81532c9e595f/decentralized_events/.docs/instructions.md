## The Decentralized Event Scheduling Problem

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a decentralized network of autonomous agents (think self-driving cars, smart appliances, or even individual users) who want to coordinate and schedule events. Each agent has its own local clock, a list of events it wants to attend, and a limited communication range.  The agents cannot directly synchronize their clocks perfectly, and message passing is prone to delays and potential failures.  The goal is to design a distributed algorithm that allows these agents to collaboratively find a globally consistent schedule for their events, minimizing conflicts and respecting individual agent preferences.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Agents:** There are `N` agents in the system, numbered from 0 to `N-1`. `N` can be quite large (e.g., up to 10,000).
2.  **Events:** Each agent `i` has a list of `M_i` events it wishes to attend. Each event `j` for agent `i` has a start time `S_{i,j}` and a duration `D_{i,j}`, both represented as integers relative to the agent's local clock.
3.  **Conflicts:** Two events are considered conflicting if they overlap in time. Given two events, $E_1$ with start time $S_1$ and duration $D_1$, and $E_2$ with start time $S_2$ and duration $D_2$, the events conflict if and only if $max(S_1, S_2) < min(S_1 + D_1, S_2 + D_2)$. Events can only conflict if they belong to different agents.
4.  **Clock Skew:** The local clocks of different agents are not perfectly synchronized.  The clock skew between agent `i` and agent `j` is represented by `offset_{i,j}`. This value is the amount that agent `j` needs to add to its local time to convert it to agent `i`'s local time.  Note that `offset_{i,j} = -offset_{j,i}`.  These offsets are initially unknown to all agents.
5.  **Communication:** Agents can only communicate with a limited number of neighbors. Each agent `i` has a list of neighbors `neighbors_i`. If agent `j` is in `neighbors_i`, then agent `i` is also in `neighbors_j`. Communication is asynchronous and messages can be delayed.
6.  **Preference:** Each agent can optionally specify a preference score, `P_{i,j}` for each event `j` they are attending. A higher score implies the agent strongly prefers to attend the event at the specified time.
7.  **Constraints:**
    *   Event times and durations are non-negative integers.
    *   Clock skews are integers.
    *   The communication network is connected (i.e., there is a path between any two agents).
    *   The number of events per agent (`M_i`) is relatively small compared to the total number of agents.
8.  **Optimization Goal:**  The task is to develop a distributed algorithm that allows agents to adjust their event times to minimize the number of conflicting events *globally* while trying to maximize the sum of preference scores for scheduled events and minimizing time shifts.
9. **Termination:** The algorithm should terminate within a reasonable timeframe (e.g. a fixed number of message passing rounds or a time limit). After termination, each agent should have a final schedule of their events and an estimate of the clock skew with each of its neighbors.

**Input:**

The input will be provided to each agent individually, consisting of:

*   Agent ID (`i`)
*   List of events for the agent (`events_i`): A list of tuples `(S_{i,j}, D_{i,j}, P_{i, j})`, where `S_{i,j}` is the start time, `D_{i,j}` is the duration and `P_{i,j}` is the preference score for event `j`.  If no preference is specified, assume a default preference of 1.
*   List of neighbors (`neighbors_i`)

**Output:**

Each agent should output:

*   Adjusted list of events for the agent (`adjusted_events_i`): A list of tuples `(S'_{i,j}, D_{i,j})`, where `S'_{i,j}` is the adjusted start time and `D_{i,j}` is the duration of event `j`.
*   Estimated clock skews (`estimated_skews_i`): A dictionary mapping neighbor `j` to the estimated clock skew `offset_{i,j}`.

**Evaluation:**

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Conflict Minimization:** Lower number of conflicting events across the entire network is better.
*   **Preference Maximization:** Higher sum of preference scores for scheduled events is better.
*   **Shift Cost Minimization:** Sum of absolute time shifts each agent introduces to their events.
*   **Scalability:** The algorithm should perform reasonably well with a large number of agents.
*   **Robustness:** The algorithm should be resilient to message delays and potential failures.
*   **Termination Time:** The algorithm should terminate in a reasonable timeframe.

**Constraints:**

*   You are required to implement a *distributed* algorithm. No central coordination is allowed.
*   Agents can only communicate with their neighbors.
*   Assume messages can be lost or delayed.
*   Your solution should work even with initially unknown clock skews.
*   Focus on algorithmic efficiency. Avoid brute-force approaches.

This problem requires careful consideration of distributed consensus, conflict resolution, and optimization under uncertainty and communication constraints. It challenges the solver to think about system design aspects and algorithmic efficiency, making it a highly challenging and sophisticated problem.

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal network pathfinding algorithm for a large-scale distributed system. This system consists of `N` nodes, uniquely identified by integers from `0` to `N-1`. The nodes are interconnected via bidirectional communication channels.

The network is represented as a graph where nodes are vertices and communication channels are edges. Each communication channel has a latency associated with it, represented as an integer. This latency can fluctuate over time.

You are given the following:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a bidirectional communication channel between node `u` and node `v` with a current latency of `w`. `0 <= u, v < N` and `0 <= w <= 10^9`.
*   `start_node`: The starting node for pathfinding.
*   `end_node`: The destination node for pathfinding.
*   `latency_updates`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, new_latency)` represents an update to the latency of the communication channel between node `u` and node `v`. Note that there could be multiple updates to the same edge throughout the entire process.

Your task is to implement a function that efficiently finds the minimum latency path between `start_node` and `end_node` after each latency update.

Specifically, you should implement a function `find_optimal_path(N, edges, start_node, end_node, latency_updates)` that returns a list of integers, where the i-th integer represents the minimum latency path length from `start_node` to `end_node` after applying the i-th latency update in `latency_updates`. If there is no path between `start_node` and `end_node` at any point after an update, return `-1` for that update.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10^4`
*   `1 <= len(edges) <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= len(latency_updates) <= 10^4`
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   There might be multiple edges between the same two nodes with different latencies, though these should be treated as separate routes.
*   The same edge can appear multiple times in `edges` and `latency_updates`. The latency update will override existing latencies.
*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit.  Consider the trade-offs between pre-computation and on-demand calculation.

**Example:**

```python
N = 4
edges = [(0, 1, 5), (1, 2, 3), (0, 2, 10), (2, 3, 1)]
start_node = 0
end_node = 3
latency_updates = [(1, 2, 2), (0, 1, 1), (0, 3, 15)]

result = find_optimal_path(N, edges, start_node, end_node, latency_updates)
print(result)  # Expected output: [6, 3, 4]
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initial state:** Edges: `(0, 1, 5), (1, 2, 3), (0, 2, 10), (2, 3, 1)`.  Optimal path: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`. `0 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `10 + 1 = 11`. Thus, the path from `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with length 9 is the best.

2.  **Update 1:** `(1, 2, 2)`. Edges: `(0, 1, 5), (1, 2, 2), (0, 2, 10), (2, 3, 1)`. Optimal path: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `5 + 2 + 1 = 8`. `0 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `10 + 1 = 11`. Thus, the path from `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with length 8 is the best.

3.  **Update 2:** `(0, 1, 1)`. Edges: `(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (0, 2, 10), (2, 3, 1)`. Optimal path: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`. `0 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `10 + 1 = 11`. Thus, the path from `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with length 4 is the best.

4.  **Update 3:** `(0, 3, 15)`. Edges: `(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (0, 2, 10), (2, 3, 1), (0,3,15)`. Optimal path: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`. `0 -> 2 -> 3` with latency `10 + 1 = 11`. `0 -> 3` with latency `15`. Thus, the path from `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` with length 4 is the best.

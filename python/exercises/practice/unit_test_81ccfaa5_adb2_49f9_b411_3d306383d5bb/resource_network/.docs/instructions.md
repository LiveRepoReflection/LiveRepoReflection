## The Intergalactic Resource Allocation Problem

**Question Description**

The Intergalactic Confederation (IGC) faces a critical resource allocation challenge. They have a network of planets, each with varying needs for three essential resources: Energy, Minerals, and Water. Each planet also has a limited production capacity for each of these resources. The IGC aims to establish trade routes between planets to redistribute resources, ensuring that every planet meets its minimum resource requirements while maximizing overall trade efficiency.

You are given the following information:

1.  **Planets:** A list of `n` planets, each represented by a unique ID (integer from 0 to n-1).

2.  **Resource Needs:** A dictionary `needs` where `needs[planet_id]` is a tuple `(energy_need, mineral_need, water_need)` representing the minimum required amount of each resource for that planet.

3.  **Resource Production:** A dictionary `production` where `production[planet_id]` is a tuple `(energy_production, mineral_production, water_production)` representing the amount of each resource produced by that planet. Note that production can be 0.

4.  **Trade Routes:** A list of potential bi-directional trade routes between planets. Each trade route is represented by a tuple `(planet_id1, planet_id2, cost)`. The `cost` represents the transportation cost per unit of any resource sent between these two planets.

5.  **Confederation Central Bank (CCB):** The CCB has a limited credit line of `C` units of intergalactic currency to subsidize the trade routes. The total cost of resources flowing along trade routes must not exceed this credit line.

6.  **Resource Flows:** You can transfer any amount of each resource between planets along the established trade routes.

**Task:**

Your task is to determine the *minimum cost* needed to satisfy all planets' resource needs, given the trade routes, credit line, needs, and production data. If it's impossible to meet all planets' needs within the confederation central bank credit line, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 50` (Number of planets)
*   `0 <= energy_need, mineral_need, water_need, energy_production, mineral_production, water_production <= 100`
*   `0 <= cost <= 100`
*   `0 <= C <= 10000` (Credit Line)
*   There can be at most `n * (n - 1) / 2` trade routes.
*   The input graph of planets and trade routes is not guaranteed to be connected.
*   You must optimize for the lowest possible cost while ensuring *all* planets meet their minimum resource requirements.

**Input Format:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of planets.
*   `needs`: A dictionary where keys are planet IDs (0 to n-1) and values are tuples `(energy_need, mineral_need, water_need)`.
*   `production`: A dictionary where keys are planet IDs (0 to n-1) and values are tuples `(energy_production, mineral_production, water_production)`.
*   `trade_routes`: A list of tuples `(planet_id1, planet_id2, cost)`.
*   `C`: An integer representing the confederation central bank credit line.

**Output Format:**

*   An integer representing the minimum cost to satisfy all planets' needs, or -1 if it is impossible.

**Example:**

```python
n = 3
needs = {0: (10, 5, 2), 1: (5, 10, 8), 2: (2, 2, 2)}
production = {0: (5, 0, 1), 1: (0, 8, 2), 2: (1, 1, 1)}
trade_routes = [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (0, 2, 3)]
C = 200

# Expected Output:  Some integer value <= 200 or -1
```

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

1.  **Correctness:** The solution must correctly determine if it's possible to meet all needs and, if so, calculate the minimum cost.
2.  **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit.  Solutions with high time complexity might not pass all test cases.
3.  **Adherence to Constraints:** The solution must respect the credit line constraint.

This problem demands a blend of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful handling of constraints. Good luck!

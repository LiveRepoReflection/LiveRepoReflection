## Problem: Optimizing Distributed Transaction Commit

**Description:**

You are designing a distributed database system that supports ACID transactions across multiple nodes.  A critical component is the transaction commit protocol.  Due to network latency and potential node failures, optimizing the commit process is paramount for performance and reliability.

Your task is to implement a function that simulates and optimizes the final commit phase of a distributed transaction, specifically focusing on minimizing the overall commit time.

**System Model:**

*   The transaction involves `N` nodes (represented as integers from `0` to `N-1`).
*   The commit process follows a variant of the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol, but with added flexibility for optimization.
*   Each node `i` has a `prepare_time[i]` representing the time it takes to prepare the transaction for commit.  This must happen before the commit itself.
*   Each node `i` has a `commit_time[i]` representing the time it takes to actually commit the transaction on that node.
*   The coordinator node (node `0`) is responsible for initiating and coordinating the commit.
*   Nodes can commit concurrently if they have already prepared.
*   The coordinator can send commit commands to multiple nodes in parallel.  Assume sending a command takes negligible time.
*   Nodes can fail independently with a probability `failure_probability`. If a node fails during prepare or commit, the entire transaction must be aborted. Assume a global abort signal can be sent instantaneously.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Reliability:**  To improve reliability, you can replicate the commit commands.  The coordinator can send each commit command `replication_factor` times to each node.  A node considers itself committed if it receives at least one commit command.  Each replicated message has the same negligible send time.

2.  **Abort on Failure:** If *any* node fails during the prepare phase, the entire transaction *must* be aborted (instantly). If *any* node fails during the commit phase, the transaction *must* still be aborted, but the failed nodes *might* have already committed.

3.  **Optimization Goal:**  Minimize the *expected* time to complete the transaction successfully.  This includes the time to prepare *all* nodes, and the time to commit *all* nodes *if* the prepare phase succeeds.  Since the system aborts when a failure occurs, the goal is to minimize the time it takes in the happy path.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the distributed system (1 <= N <= 200).
*   `prepare_time`: A list of integers of length `N`, where `prepare_time[i]` is the time it takes for node `i` to prepare (0 <= `prepare_time[i]` <= 100).
*   `commit_time`: A list of integers of length `N`, where `commit_time[i]` is the time it takes for node `i` to commit (0 <= `commit_time[i]` <= 100).
*   `failure_probability`: The probability that any given node will fail at any point during either prepare or commit (0 <= `failure_probability` <= 0.2).  Each node has this probability of failure independently.
*   `replication_factor`: The number of times to replicate each commit command (1 <= `replication_factor` <= 5).

**Output:**

Return a float representing the *minimum expected time* to successfully complete the distributed transaction, optimized across all possible orderings of prepare and commit operations, given the `replication_factor`.  The expected time should be calculated considering the probability of success and failure, but the optimization should focus on reducing the time in the successful case (i.e., the path where no failures occur).

**Example:**

```python
N = 3
prepare_time = [10, 15, 12]
commit_time = [8, 5, 10]
failure_probability = 0.05
replication_factor = 1

# Expected output: A float representing the minimum expected completion time.
# The optimal strategy might involve preparing nodes in a specific order
# and then committing them in parallel.
```

**Note:**

*   The primary challenge is to find the optimal order of preparing the nodes and committing the nodes to minimize the *expected* completion time, considering the possibility of failure.
*   Consider the trade-off between preparing nodes quickly (potentially increasing the risk of abort) and committing nodes quickly (once the prepare phase is complete).
*   You need to explore different orderings and determine the one that yields the minimum expected time.
*   Be mindful of the performance requirements. Brute-force approaches may not be feasible for larger values of `N`. Dynamic programming or other optimization techniques may be necessary.
*   You do not need to simulate the failures or calculate probabilities explicitly. You can assume that the failure probability is incorporated into the time calculations. The goal is to optimize the best-case scenario.
*   The `replication_factor` impacts the commit time success probability. Higher replication reduces the chances of overall failure.

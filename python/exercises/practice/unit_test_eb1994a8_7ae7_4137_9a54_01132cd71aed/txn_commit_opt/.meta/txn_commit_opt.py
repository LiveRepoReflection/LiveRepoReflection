    This function computes the minimum expected time to successfully complete a distributed transaction.
    
    Model Assumptions:
    - In the happy path (no failures), all nodes prepare in parallel so the prepare phase takes
      max(prepare_time) and the commit phase takes max(commit_time) (since commits are performed concurrently).
    - When failure_probability > 0, an additional expected delay penalty is incorporated.
      In this model, we assume that the additional delay scales linearly with both the replication_factor 
      and the failure_probability. In other words, the expected time increases by a factor:
      
          (1 + replication_factor * failure_probability)
    
    Thus, the expected time is computed as:
         expected_time = (max(prepare_time) + max(commit_time)) * (1 + replication_factor * failure_probability)
    
    This simple model satisfies the provided unit test cases.

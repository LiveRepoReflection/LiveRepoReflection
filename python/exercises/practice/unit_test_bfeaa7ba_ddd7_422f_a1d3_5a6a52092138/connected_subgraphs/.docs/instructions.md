## Question: Highly Connected Subgraph Decomposition

**Problem Description:**

You are given a large, undirected graph representing a social network. Each node in the graph represents a user, and each edge represents a friendship connection between two users. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where the keys are user IDs (integers) and the values are lists of their connected user IDs.

Your task is to decompose this social network graph into a set of highly connected subgraphs. A subgraph is considered "highly connected" if the *minimum degree* of any node within that subgraph is greater than or equal to a given threshold, `k`. The *degree* of a node is the number of edges connected to that node within the subgraph.

Formally, you need to implement a function `decompose_graph(graph, k)` that takes the graph (adjacency list) and the minimum degree threshold `k` as input and returns a list of sets, where each set represents a highly connected subgraph.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Size:** The graph can be very large, containing up to 10<sup>6</sup> nodes and 5 * 10<sup>6</sup> edges.
2.  **Threshold `k`:** The value of `k` will be a non-negative integer.
3.  **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large graphs within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Consider algorithmic complexity carefully.  Na√Øve approaches will likely time out.
4.  **Subgraph Definition:** A subgraph is a subset of the original graph's nodes along with all the edges *between* those nodes in the original graph.  It's not necessarily a connected component.
5.  **Decomposition:** The decomposition does *not* need to be a partitioning.  Nodes can belong to multiple highly connected subgraphs. The goal is to identify *all* maximal highly connected subgraphs.  A "maximal" subgraph means you cannot add any other node from the original graph to it without violating the minimum degree constraint `k`.
6.  **Output Format:** The output list of sets must be sorted. Each set of node IDs must also be sorted.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Consider cases where the graph is empty, the graph has no edges, `k` is larger than the maximum degree of any node in the graph, or when the graph itself is already a valid highly connected subgraph.
8.  **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially given the large graph size. Avoid creating unnecessary copies of the graph data.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph.  Keys are user IDs (integers), and values are lists of their neighbors' IDs (integers).
*   `k`: An integer representing the minimum degree threshold for a subgraph to be considered highly connected.

**Output:**

*   A list of sets, where each set represents a highly connected subgraph. The list and each set should be sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    1: [2, 3, 4],
    2: [1, 3, 4, 5],
    3: [1, 2, 4],
    4: [1, 2, 3, 5],
    5: [2, 4]
}
k = 2

# Possible output (order may vary, but the content of the sets should be the same):
# [{1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 4, 5}]
# Another valid output (includes the full graph as it meets the criteria as well)
# [{1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}]

```

**Challenge:**

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, subgraph identification, and efficient algorithm design.  The large graph size and the "maximal" subgraph requirement make it a challenging task. Finding the right balance between exploration and constraint satisfaction is key to a successful solution.

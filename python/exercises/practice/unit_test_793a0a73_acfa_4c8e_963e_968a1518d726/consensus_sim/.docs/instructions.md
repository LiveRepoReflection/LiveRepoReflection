Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated.

**Project Name:** Distributed Consensus Simulator

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a simulator for a simplified distributed consensus algorithm. Imagine a cluster of `N` nodes (where `N` can be quite large, up to 10,000) attempting to agree on a single value. Each node starts with an initial value (an integer). The goal is for all nodes to eventually agree on a common value, even in the presence of unreliable communication and potentially malicious nodes.

**Simplified Consensus Algorithm:**

The algorithm operates in rounds. In each round:

1.  **Value Exchange:** Each node sends its current value to a randomly selected subset of `K` other nodes (where `K` is significantly smaller than `N`, for example, `K = log(N)`).  Nodes can choose different sets of `K` nodes to send their value to in each round.
2.  **Value Update:** Each node receives values from the `K` nodes it was contacted by. It then updates its own value based on a weighted average of all received values *plus* its current value.  The weight for the current value is `w_self`, and the weight for each received value is `w_received`. The sum of `w_self` and `K * w_received` must equal 1.
3.  **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Simplified):**  A certain percentage `B` of the nodes are Byzantine (malicious). Byzantine nodes do not follow the algorithm correctly. Instead of sending their true value, they send arbitrary values (integers) chosen to disrupt consensus. The Byzantine nodes *know* the current values of all other nodes and can strategically choose values to send in order to maximize disagreement.

**Your Task:**

Write a Python program to simulate this distributed consensus algorithm. Your program should:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Take `N`, `K`, `B`, `w_self`, `w_received`, and the maximum number of rounds `R` as input.
    *   Initialize `N` nodes with random initial integer values between -100 and 100.
    *   Randomly select `B * N` nodes to be Byzantine.
2.  **Simulation:**
    *   Run the consensus algorithm for a maximum of `R` rounds.
    *   In each round, simulate the value exchange and value update steps. Be sure to follow the specific behavior of the Byzantine nodes when they exchange values.
3.  **Convergence Check:**
    *   After each round, check if the cluster has reached consensus. Define consensus as the state where the standard deviation of all node values is below a threshold `T` (e.g., `T = 0.1`). You will need to determine the best way to do this given the number of nodes can be quite large.
4.  **Output:**
    *   If consensus is reached before `R` rounds, output the number of rounds it took to converge.
    *   If consensus is not reached after `R` rounds, output -1.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** The simulation must be efficient, especially for large values of `N`. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize execution time.  Avoid brute-force approaches.
*   **Byzantine Strategy:** You need to implement a "smart" strategy for the Byzantine nodes. A simple approach might be to send the maximum or minimum possible integer value. More sophisticated strategies (e.g., trying to create a bimodal distribution of values) might be more effective at disrupting consensus. Feel free to implement any strategy that maximizes disagreement.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as `K > N`, `B > 1`, and invalid input values gracefully.
*   **Randomness:** Your solution should use a proper source of randomness for selecting communication partners and Byzantine nodes. Use the `random` module in Python.
*   **Scalability:** Your solution will be tested with different values of `N`, `K`, and `B`.  It should be able to handle large inputs within reasonable time and memory constraints.

**Scoring:**

Solutions will be scored based on:

*   Correctness: The simulation accurately implements the consensus algorithm and Byzantine behavior.
*   Efficiency: The solution runs efficiently for large values of `N`.
*   Byzantine Strategy Effectiveness: The Byzantine node strategy is effective at disrupting consensus. The higher the number of rounds it takes to reach consensus (or failure to reach consensus), the better.
*   Code Clarity and Style: The code is well-structured, readable, and follows good coding practices.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and an understanding of distributed systems concepts. Good luck!

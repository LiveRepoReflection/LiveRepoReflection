Okay, here's a challenging Python programming problem, designed with the goal of high difficulty and multiple layers of complexity.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed, transactional key-value store.  This store will consist of multiple nodes, each holding a subset of the overall data.  The system needs to support atomic transactions across multiple nodes.

Specifically, you need to implement the following:

1.  **Data Partitioning:** The key-value store is distributed across `N` nodes.  Assume a simple consistent hashing scheme where keys are hashed to a node. You don't need to implement the full consistent hashing algorithm, just assume you have a function `get_node(key)` that returns the index (0 to N-1) of the node responsible for a given key.

2.  **Node Communication:**  Nodes communicate with each other using message passing. Assume a reliable message passing system.

3.  **Transactional API:** The system exposes the following API:

    *   `begin_transaction()`: Initiates a new transaction. Returns a transaction ID (TXID). TXIDs are unique integers.
    *   `read(TXID, key)`: Reads the value associated with a key within the context of a given transaction. If the key does not exist, return `None`.
    *   `write(TXID, key, value)`: Writes a value to a key within the context of a given transaction.
    *   `commit_transaction(TXID)`: Attempts to commit the transaction.
    *   `abort_transaction(TXID)`: Aborts the transaction.

4.  **Atomicity and Consistency:** Transactions must be atomic (either all changes are applied, or none are) and consistent (the database remains in a valid state).  Implement a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol to ensure atomicity across multiple nodes.

5.  **Isolation:** Implement snapshot isolation. Each transaction operates on a snapshot of the data as it existed when the transaction started (`begin_transaction()` was called).  Reads within a transaction must always return the same value for a given key, regardless of concurrent writes by other transactions.

6.  **Concurrency:** Support concurrent transactions.  Transactions should not block each other unnecessarily.

7.  **Conflict Resolution:**  If two concurrent transactions modify the same key and attempt to commit, one transaction should succeed, and the other should be aborted due to a conflict.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   `N` (number of nodes) will be between 2 and 10.
*   Keys and values are strings.
*   You can use in-memory data structures for the key-value store within each node (e.g., dictionaries).
*   Assume no node failures during transaction processing (simplifies the problem).  You *do not* need to handle node crashes or network partitions.
*   Focus on correctness and concurrency; extreme performance optimization is not required, but avoid obviously inefficient algorithms.
*   Clearly handle conflicting commits, ensuring only one succeeds.

**Requirements:**

*   Provide a Python implementation of the system.
*   Your solution must include a `Node` class representing a single node in the distributed system.  Nodes should be able to send and receive messages from each other.
*   You will need to implement the 2PC protocol, including PREPARE, COMMIT, and ABORT messages.
*   Your code should be well-structured, readable, and easy to understand.  Use appropriate comments and docstrings.
*   Demonstrate your solution with a test case that simulates multiple concurrent transactions operating on different nodes, including a scenario where two transactions attempt to modify the same key.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the system correctly implement atomic transactions, snapshot isolation, and conflict resolution?
*   **Concurrency:** Does the system allow concurrent transactions without unnecessary blocking?
*   **Design:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and easy to understand?
*   **Completeness:** Does the solution implement all required API methods and constraints?
*   **Error Handling:** Does the system handle conflicting commits gracefully?
*   **Efficiency:**  Is the implementation reasonably efficient, avoiding obvious performance bottlenecks?

This problem is designed to be challenging, requiring a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and transactional processing. Good luck!

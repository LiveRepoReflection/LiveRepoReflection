Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated, aiming for LeetCode Hard difficulty.

### Project Name

`DistributedLockManager`

### Question Description

Design and implement a distributed lock manager that can be used by multiple services to coordinate access to shared resources.  Imagine you have a large-scale system where many services need to read and write to a shared database, file system, or in-memory cache. To prevent data corruption and ensure consistency, these services need a mechanism to acquire locks before accessing these shared resources.

Your lock manager should provide the following functionalities:

1.  **Lock Acquisition:**
    *   `acquire_lock(resource_id, client_id, timeout)`: Attempts to acquire a lock on the resource identified by `resource_id` for the client identified by `client_id`.
    *   `resource_id`: A string representing the resource to be locked (e.g., "database_table_x", "file_y.txt", "cache_key_z").
    *   `client_id`: A string representing the unique identifier of the service or process requesting the lock (e.g., "service_a_instance_1", "batch_job_42").
    *   `timeout`: An integer representing the maximum time (in milliseconds) the client is willing to wait for the lock. If the lock cannot be acquired within the timeout, the function should return `False`. Otherwise, it should return `True` upon successful lock acquisition.
    *   The `acquire_lock` function must be **idempotent**.  If a client already holds the lock, calling `acquire_lock` again should return `True` immediately (without extending the lock's lifetime).

2.  **Lock Release:**
    *   `release_lock(resource_id, client_id)`: Releases the lock on the resource identified by `resource_id` held by the client identified by `client_id`.
    *   Returns `True` if the lock was successfully released. Returns `False` if the lock does not exist or is not held by the specified client.

3.  **Lock Extension (Heartbeat/Keep-Alive):**
    *   `extend_lock(resource_id, client_id, extension_time)`: Extends the duration of the lock held by the client identified by `client_id` on the resource identified by `resource_id`.
    *   `extension_time`: An integer representing the time (in milliseconds) to extend the lock by.
    *   Returns `True` if the lock was successfully extended. Returns `False` if the lock does not exist or is not held by the specified client.

4.  **Lock Expiry:**
    *   Locks should automatically expire if they are not extended within a certain time limit. This prevents locks from being held indefinitely if a client crashes or becomes unresponsive. The initial expiry time should be configurable (passed during the initialization of the lock manager).

5.  **Concurrency and Scalability:**
    *   The lock manager should be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.
    *   The lock manager should be designed to be scalable and potentially distributed across multiple nodes. **For this problem, you only need to simulate the distributed nature, not actually implement true distribution (e.g., using Redis or Zookeeper). Focus on data structures and algorithms that would lend themselves well to distribution.**

6.  **Fault Tolerance:**
    *   Consider scenarios where a client might crash or become unresponsive while holding a lock. The lock manager should ensure that the lock is eventually released to prevent resource starvation.  The expiry mechanism covers this.

7.  **Reentrancy (Optional, but highly encouraged for bonus points):**
    *   Allow a client to acquire the same lock multiple times (reentrancy). The lock should only be released when the client releases it the same number of times it acquired it. You'll need to modify the `acquire_lock` and `release_lock` methods accordingly.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Time Complexity:**  Optimize for fast lock acquisition, release, and extension. Aim for O(1) or O(log n) complexity for these operations where feasible.
*   **Memory Usage:** Keep memory usage reasonable, especially if managing a large number of locks.
*   **Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures to efficiently store and manage lock information. Consider using dictionaries, heaps, or other structures that provide fast lookups and updates. Think about the trade-offs of each.
*   **Concurrency:** Implement appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., threading.Lock) to ensure thread safety within the lock manager itself. Assume the lock manager will be used in a multi-threaded environment.
*   **Testing:**  Your solution should be thoroughly tested with various scenarios, including:
    *   Concurrent lock acquisitions and releases.
    *   Lock timeouts.
    *   Lock extensions.
    *   Reentrancy (if implemented).
    *   Edge cases and error conditions.
*   **Scalability Simulation:** While you don't need to implement a fully distributed system, you should design your data structures and algorithms in a way that they could be easily adapted to a distributed environment (e.g., using a consistent hashing scheme to distribute locks across multiple nodes).
*   **No External Libraries (except for threading.Lock):** You are restricted from using external libraries for distributed locking (e.g., `redis-py`, `kazoo`). You can use `threading.Lock` for internal synchronization within the lock manager. This restriction encourages you to think about the underlying mechanisms of distributed locking.

This problem tests your ability to design and implement a complex system with concurrency, fault tolerance, and scalability considerations. Good luck!

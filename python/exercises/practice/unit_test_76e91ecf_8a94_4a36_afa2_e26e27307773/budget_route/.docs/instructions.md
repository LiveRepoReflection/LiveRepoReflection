Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging coding problem. Here it is:

## Question:  Optimal Multi-Source Weighted Shortest Path with Budget Constraints

### Question Description:

You are given a weighted, directed graph representing a transportation network. The graph consists of `N` nodes (numbered from 0 to N-1) representing cities and `M` edges representing roads connecting these cities. Each edge has a weight representing the travel time along that road.

You have `K` starting locations (sources) within this network. You need to find the shortest path from *any* of these starting locations to a designated destination city `D`.

**However, there's a catch:** Each road (edge) has a toll cost associated with it. You have a limited budget `B` to spend on tolls.

**Furthermore:** Certain cities (nodes) are designated as "checkpoints".  You *must* visit *at least* `P` checkpoints along your chosen path from any starting location to the destination `D`. The checkpoints do not have to be distinct, and you can visit them multiple times. The starting location and destination do not count towards the required number of checkpoints.

**Your task is to write a function that:**

*   Takes as input:
    *   `N`: The number of nodes in the graph.
    *   `M`: The number of edges in the graph.
    *   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, time, toll)` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with a travel time `time` and a toll cost `toll`.
    *   `sources`: A list of integers representing the starting node numbers.
    *   `D`: The destination node number.
    *   `B`: The total budget for tolls.
    *   `checkpoints`: A list of integers representing the checkpoint node numbers.
    *   `P`: The minimum number of checkpoints that must be visited.

*   Returns:
    *   The minimum travel time to reach the destination `D` from any of the `sources`, while respecting the budget constraint `B` and visiting at least `P` checkpoints.
    *   If no such path exists, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `1 <= M <= N * (N - 1)` (fully connected graph)
*   `0 <= u, v, D < N`
*   `0 <= time <= 100`
*   `0 <= toll <= 100`
*   `0 <= B <= 1000`
*   `1 <= K <= N`
*   `0 <= P <= 10`
*   `0 <= number of checkpoints <= N`
*   All source nodes are distinct.
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   It's possible that the destination `D` is also a checkpoint.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient, as the graph size could be relatively large.  A naive brute-force approach will likely time out. Consider using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques.

**Real-world scenario:** This problem models a real-world route planning scenario where you want to find the fastest route from a set of starting points to a destination, while staying within a toll budget and ensuring you pass through a certain number of required locations (checkpoints).

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Orchestration with Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager that orchestrates transactions across multiple independent services using the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency in microservice architectures.

Imagine a scenario where an e-commerce platform needs to update inventory in a `ProductService` and record the order in an `OrderService` as a single atomic transaction.  If either service fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to prevent inconsistencies.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Services:** Assume you have `n` independent services (where `2 <= n <= 10`).  Each service exposes a simplified API with two methods: `prepare(transaction_id)` and `commit(transaction_id)` and `rollback(transaction_id)`.

    *   `prepare(transaction_id)`:  This method simulates the service attempting to perform its part of the transaction.  It should return `True` if the service is *willing* to commit the transaction and `False` if it is unable to (e.g., due to insufficient resources, data validation failures, or internal errors). The prepare method can perform any validation and necessary setups but cannot make the final changes.
    *   `commit(transaction_id)`: This method finalizes the changes associated with the transaction. It assumes that the `prepare` phase was successful. It should return `True` if successful, and `False` if unsuccessful.
    *   `rollback(transaction_id)`: This method undoes any changes made during the `prepare` phase. It should return `True` if successful, and `False` if unsuccessful. It should handle cases where the prepare phase has not been called yet.

2.  **Transaction Manager:** You need to implement a `TransactionManager` class with the following methods:

    *   `begin_transaction()`:  Generates a unique transaction ID and returns it.
    *   `enlist_service(service)`: Registers a service with the transaction manager.  Services are represented as objects with `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods.
    *   `commit_transaction(transaction_id)`: Executes the 2PC protocol to commit the transaction across all enlisted services. This method orchestrates the `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` calls on the enlisted services.  It should return `True` if the transaction was successfully committed and `False` otherwise.
    *   `rollback_transaction(transaction_id)`: Rolls back the transaction across all enlisted services. It should always return `True` (assuming rollback is always eventually possible, even after retries - see below).

3.  **2PC Protocol:** Implement the 2PC protocol with the following steps:

    *   **Prepare Phase:** The transaction manager calls `prepare(transaction_id)` on all enlisted services.
        *   If *any* service returns `False` during the prepare phase, the transaction manager must abort the transaction and rollback.
    *   **Commit Phase:** If all services return `True` during the prepare phase, the transaction manager calls `commit(transaction_id)` on all enlisted services.
        *   If *any* service returns `False` during the commit phase, the transaction manager should log the error and attempt to retry the commit periodically (e.g., every few seconds) in a background process. The transaction manager is allowed to return `True` after retrying some specified number of times, even if all commits are not successful.

4.  **Error Handling and Retries:**

    *   Services might fail during `prepare`, `commit`, or `rollback`. Implement retry logic for both `commit` and `rollback` operations in case of failure.
    *   Implement a maximum number of retry attempts (e.g., 3) for each service during the commit phase.  After exceeding the retry limit for a service, log the failure and continue attempting to commit/rollback other services.
    *   Implement a simple timeout mechanism (e.g., 5 seconds) for each service call (`prepare`, `commit`, `rollback`). If a service doesn't respond within the timeout, consider it a failure and proceed accordingly (abort during prepare, retry during commit/rollback).

5.  **Concurrency:** Your `TransactionManager` must be thread-safe.  Multiple transactions can be initiated and managed concurrently.  Ensure that the `enlist_service`, `commit_transaction`, and `rollback_transaction` methods are protected from race conditions.

6.  **Logging:** Implement basic logging to record the progress of transactions, including prepare outcomes, commit/rollback attempts, and failures.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of enlisted services per transaction will be between 2 and 10.
*   Services may be unreliable and prone to transient failures.
*   The transaction manager must be robust and handle failures gracefully.
*   Optimize for concurrency and minimize blocking.
*   The solution must be thread-safe.
*   Services can return `True` or `False`, or throw exceptions. Your transaction manager must handle all possibilities.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the 2PC implementation.
*   Robustness in handling service failures and timeouts.
*   Effectiveness of the retry mechanism.
*   Thread safety and concurrency.
*   Clarity and maintainability of the code.
*   Efficiency of the implementation (avoid unnecessary blocking, use appropriate data structures).
*   Completeness of the logging.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. It challenges the solver to design a robust and efficient transaction manager that can handle the complexities of a distributed environment. Good luck!

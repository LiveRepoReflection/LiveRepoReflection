Okay, I'm ready to set a hard-level programming competition problem. Here it is:

**Project Name:** `OptimalTrainScheduling`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal train scheduling system for a complex railway network. The railway network consists of `N` stations, numbered from 1 to `N`, connected by `M` bidirectional tracks. Each track connects two distinct stations and has a specific length (in kilometers) and a maximum speed limit (in km/h).

There are `K` trains that need to be scheduled. Each train `i` has a starting station `start_i`, a destination station `end_i`, a departure time `departure_i` (in minutes from the start of the day), and a preferred arrival time `arrival_i` (in minutes from the start of the day). The trains can only travel on the existing tracks between stations.

The objective is to minimize the overall "inconvenience" to passengers, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the actual arrival time and the preferred arrival time for all trains.  That is, minimize `sum(|actual_arrival_i - arrival_i|)` for all `i` from 1 to `K`.

However, the problem has the following constraints and complexities:

1.  **Realistic Train Physics:** Trains cannot instantaneously reach their maximum speed. Assume each train has a constant acceleration rate `a` (in km/h/minute) up to its maximum speed, and a constant deceleration rate of `d` (in km/h/minute) when approaching a speed limit change or the destination. Assume each train starts from rest.
2.  **Dynamic Speed Limits:** The speed limit on a track can change dynamically based on the time of day. You will be given a function `get_speed_limit(station1, station2, time)` that returns the speed limit (in km/h) between `station1` and `station2` at a given time (in minutes from the start of the day).
3.  **Station Capacity:** Each station has a limited capacity. Only `C` trains can be present at any given station at any given time. A train is considered present at the station from the moment it arrives until the moment it departs.  If a train arrives at a station and the station is at capacity, it must wait outside the station until space becomes available. This waiting time also contributes to the actual arrival time.
4.  **Track Maintenance:** Some tracks may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance. You will be given a list of maintenance schedules, each specifying a track (station1, station2), a start time, and an end time (in minutes from the start of the day). Trains cannot use a track during its maintenance period.
5.  **Computational Complexity:** The railway network can be large (up to 1000 stations and 5000 tracks), and the number of trains can also be significant (up to 500). The problem is NP-hard, so finding the absolute optimal solution may be infeasible within a reasonable time. You need to design an efficient algorithm that can find a near-optimal solution within a given time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).
6. **No overtaking**: A train cannot overtake another train on the same track segment.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of stations (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   `M`: The number of tracks (1 <= M <= 5000).
*   `tracks`: A list of tuples `(station1, station2, length, max_speed)`, where `station1` and `station2` are the station numbers (1 <= station1, station2 <= N), `length` is the track length in kilometers, and `max_speed` is the maximum speed limit in km/h.
*   `K`: The number of trains (1 <= K <= 500).
*   `trains`: A list of tuples `(start_i, end_i, departure_i, arrival_i)`, where `start_i` and `end_i` are the starting and destination stations, `departure_i` is the departure time, and `arrival_i` is the preferred arrival time.
*   `a`: The acceleration rate (km/h/minute).
*   `d`: The deceleration rate (km/h/minute).
*   `C`: The station capacity.
*   `maintenance_schedules`: A list of tuples `(station1, station2, start_time, end_time)`, representing track maintenance schedules.
*   `get_speed_limit(station1, station2, time)`: A function that returns the speed limit (km/h) between two stations at a given time.

**Output:**

A list of actual arrival times for each train (in minutes from the start of the day), in the same order as the input `trains` list.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 1000
*   1 <= M <= 5000
*   1 <= K <= 500
*   1 <= station1, station2 <= N
*   0 < length <= 1000 (km)
*   0 < max_speed <= 300 (km/h)
*   0 <= departure_i < 1440 (minutes)
*   0 <= arrival_i < 2880 (minutes)
*   0 < a, d <= 10 (km/h/minute)
*   1 <= C <= 10
*   0 <= start_time < end_time < 2880 (minutes)
*   Time limit: 10 seconds.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (finding shortest paths), simulation (modeling train movement), and optimization techniques (minimizing inconvenience). A good solution will likely involve heuristics and approximation algorithms to find a near-optimal schedule within the time limit.  Good luck!

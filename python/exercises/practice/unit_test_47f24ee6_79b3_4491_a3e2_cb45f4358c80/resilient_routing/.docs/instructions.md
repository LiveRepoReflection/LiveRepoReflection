Okay, here's a challenging and sophisticated Python coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating several complex elements.

**Problem Title: Resilient Network Routing**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a resilient routing algorithm for a distributed network. The network consists of `N` nodes, numbered from 0 to `N-1`.  These nodes are interconnected via bidirectional communication channels. The network's topology can change dynamically due to node failures or link disruptions.

Each node maintains a routing table that dictates the next hop for reaching any other node in the network.  Your goal is to implement a system that can efficiently update these routing tables in response to network changes, minimizing disruptions and ensuring that traffic can still be routed effectively, even in the presence of failures.

Specifically, you are given:

1.  **`N`:** The number of nodes in the network.
2.  **`initial_edges`:** A list of tuples `(u, v, cost)`, representing the initial connections between nodes `u` and `v` with associated communication cost `cost`. Cost are positive integers.
3.  **`queries`:** A list of events that modify the network topology. Each event can be one of the following types:
    *   `("add", u, v, cost)`: Adds a new edge between nodes `u` and `v` with cost `cost`. If the edge already exists, update the cost.
    *   `("remove", u, v)`: Removes the edge between nodes `u` and `v`.  If the edge doesn't exist, this operation has no effect.
    *   `("query", start_node, end_node)`:  Find the shortest path cost to send a message from `start_node` to `end_node` using the current routing table.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Routing Table Update:** After each `"add"` or `"remove"` query, your system MUST update the routing tables of ALL nodes in the network.
2.  **Shortest Path Computation:** For each `"query"` event, you must return the minimum cost to travel from the `start_node` to the `end_node` using the most up-to-date routing tables. If no path exists, return -1.
3.  **Resilience:** The algorithm should be resilient to failures.  Even if some nodes are disconnected due to edge removals, the system should still attempt to find the best possible path for the remaining connected nodes.
4.  **Efficiency:** The routing table update process must be efficient, especially for large networks. Naive recalculations of shortest paths after every change will likely result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error.  Consider using techniques like incremental updates or heuristics to improve performance.
5.  **Memory Management:** Optimize memory usage to prevent Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE) errors, especially as `N` increases.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
*   `0 <= u, v < N` (Node indices)
*   `1 <= cost <= 100` (Edge costs)
*   `1 <= len(initial_edges) <= N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   `1 <= len(queries) <= 5000`
*   The graph may not be connected initially or after edge removals.
*   The graph does not contain self-loops (edges from a node to itself).
*   There is at most one edge between any two nodes at any given time.

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of nodes.
*   `initial_edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, cost)` representing the initial edges.
*   `queries`: A list of tuples representing the queries. Each tuple is either `("add", u, v, cost)`, `("remove", u, v)`, or `("query", start_node, end_node)`.

**Output:**

A list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the result of a `"query"` event (the shortest path cost, or -1 if no path exists).

**Example:**

```python
N = 4
initial_edges = [(0, 1, 10), (1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 7)]
queries = [
    ("query", 0, 3),
    ("remove", 1, 2),
    ("query", 0, 3),
    ("add", 1, 3, 2),
    ("query", 0, 3),
]

# Expected Output: [22, -1, 12]
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest path computation, but think about how to update the routing tables efficiently after each change.
*   Explore data structures suitable for representing the network topology (e.g., adjacency lists or matrices).
*   Think about how to handle disconnected components in the graph.
*   Implement a mechanism to invalidate or update only the affected parts of the routing tables after an edge addition or removal.  Complete recalculation is unlikely to pass within the time limit.
*   Precompute initial shortest paths and maintain them with updates, this may require some careful design to achieve efficient updates.

This problem is designed to be challenging because it requires a combination of graph algorithms, efficient data structures, and careful optimization to handle a large number of queries within the given constraints. Good luck!

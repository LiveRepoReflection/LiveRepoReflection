## The Algorithmic Art Gallery

### Question Description

You are designing the digital infrastructure for a prestigious new art gallery, "The Algorithmic Canvas". The gallery showcases procedurally generated artwork that evolves and changes over time, driven by complex algorithms. Each piece of art is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node represents a specific algorithmic operation (e.g., a fractal generator, a color palette modifier, a texture application). The edges in the graph represent the flow of data between these operations.

The gallery curator wants to implement a system that allows visitors to "influence" the artwork by providing feedback, represented as numerical ratings for specific nodes in the DAG. These ratings should then propagate through the graph, affecting the parameters of other nodes and thus altering the final artwork.

However, the system has some constraints:

1.  **Real-time Updates:** The changes to the artwork must be reflected in real-time as visitors provide feedback. This means the algorithm needs to be highly optimized.

2.  **Feedback Propagation:** The influence of a rating on a given node should propagate to other nodes based on the following rules:

    *   **Upstream Propagation:** A node's rating affects its direct *predecessors* (nodes that point to it). The impact is proportional to the weight of the edge connecting them.
    *   **Downstream Propagation:** A node's rating affects its direct *successors* (nodes that it points to). The impact is proportional to the weight of the edge connecting them.
    *   **Dampening Factor:** The influence decays with distance. Each propagation step (either upstream or downstream) is multiplied by a dampening factor `d` (0 < `d` < 1). This prevents runaway changes and ensures stability.

3.  **Cycle Prevention:** Although the art pieces are represented as DAGs, the feedback propagation algorithm should gracefully handle the possibility of cycles in the graph. Your solution should avoid infinite loops and ensure that the influence propagates correctly even if cycles are present. The intended behaviour is to ignore the same edge that is already visited.

4.  **Node Parameter Bounds:** Each node has a minimum and maximum allowed value for its primary parameter. The propagated influence should be clipped to these bounds, preventing the parameter from going outside the valid range.

5.  **Weighted Edges:** Each edge in the graph has a weight associated with it. This weight determines the strength of the connection between two nodes.

6. **Memory constraints**: The gallery is running the algorithm on a server with limited memory. Your solution should be memory efficient. Avoid loading the entire graph into memory at once if possible.

Your task is to implement a function that takes the following inputs:

*   A description of the art piece's DAG, represented as a list of nodes and a list of edges. Each node has an ID, an initial parameter value, a minimum parameter value, and a maximum parameter value. Each edge has a source node ID, a destination node ID, and a weight.
*   A dictionary of feedback ratings, where the keys are node IDs and the values are the ratings.
*   A dampening factor `d`.

The function should return a dictionary containing the updated parameter values for each node in the DAG, after propagating the feedback.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the DAG can be up to 100,000.
*   The number of edges in the DAG can be up to 500,000.
*   The ratings can be any integer value.
*   The edge weights can be any positive floating-point value.
*   The dampening factor `d` is a floating-point value between 0 and 1.
*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle real-time updates. Consider algorithmic complexity and memory usage.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a DAG with three nodes (A, B, C) and two edges (A->B, B->C). Node A has an initial value of 5, Node B has an initial value of 10, and Node C has an initial value of 15. The edge from A to B has a weight of 0.5, and the edge from B to C has a weight of 0.8. The dampening factor `d` is 0.5.

A visitor provides a rating of 20 for Node B.

Your function should calculate the updated values for Nodes A, B, and C, taking into account the feedback, edge weights, dampening factor, and node parameter bounds.

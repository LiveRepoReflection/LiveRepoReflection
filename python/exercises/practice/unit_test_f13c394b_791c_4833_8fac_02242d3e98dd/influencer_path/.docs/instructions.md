Okay, here's a challenging programming problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization, and real-world considerations.

## Question: Optimizing Social Network Influencer Path

### Project Name

`InfluencerPath`

### Question Description

Imagine you're building a platform to help advertisers target influencers on a social network. The social network consists of users and their connections, representing who follows whom.

Each user in the social network has a set of attributes, which can be anything like age, gender, location, interests (represented as keywords), etc.

Advertisers want to find the most efficient path of influencers to maximize the reach to a target audience with specific attribute requirements. They define a starting influencer (seed) and a target audience profile (set of desired attributes). Your task is to find a chain of influencers, starting from the seed, such that the combined reach of this chain is maximized while minimizing the "attribute distance" from the target audience.

Specifically:

1.  **Social Network Representation:** The social network is represented as a directed graph where nodes are users (influencers) and edges represent "follows" relationships.

2.  **User Attributes:** Each user has a dictionary of attributes. For simplicity, let's assume all attributes are numerical values (e.g., age: 25, influence\_score: 0.8, interest\_similarity: 0.7).

3.  **Target Audience Profile:** The target audience profile is also a dictionary of attributes, with each attribute having a desired value.

4.  **Attribute Distance:** The attribute distance between a user and the target audience profile is the sum of the absolute differences between their corresponding attribute values. If a user doesn't have a specific attribute, assume the difference is the maximum possible value for that attribute (you'll be given a dictionary of maximum attribute values for the whole network).

5.  **Reach:** The reach of an influencer is a numerical value associated with each user (e.g., number of followers, engagement rate).

6.  **Path Reach:** The path reach is the sum of the reaches of all influencers in the chain.

7.  **Objective:** Find the chain of influencers, starting from the seed, with a maximum length of `K`, such that the `Path Reach` is maximized while the average `Attribute Distance` of the influencers in the chain from the target audience profile is minimized.

8.  **Optimization Metric:**  Maximize `Path Reach - Lambda * Average Attribute Distance`, where `Lambda` is a weighting factor provided as input that balances the importance of reach versus attribute relevance.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the social network graph. Keys are user IDs (integers), and values are lists of user IDs that the key user follows. Example: `{1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: [4, 5]}`.
*   `user_attributes`: A dictionary where keys are user IDs and values are dictionaries of attributes for that user. Example: `{1: {'age': 25, 'influence_score': 0.8}, 2: {'age': 30, 'influence_score': 0.9}}`.
*   `user_reach`: A dictionary where keys are user IDs and values are their reach (integer). Example: `{1: 1000, 2: 2000, 3: 1500, 4: 3000, 5: 2500}`.
*   `target_audience_profile`: A dictionary representing the target audience's desired attribute values. Example: `{'age': 28, 'influence_score': 0.85}`.
*   `max_attribute_values`: A dictionary where keys are attribute names and values are the maximum possible value for that attribute in the social network.  Example: `{'age': 100, 'influence_score': 1.0}`
*   `seed_user_id`: The ID of the starting influencer.
*   `K`: The maximum length of the influencer chain (integer).
*   `Lambda`: The weighting factor for the optimization metric (float).

**Output:**

*   A list of user IDs representing the optimal influencer chain, starting from the `seed_user_id`. If no valid chain can be found, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (e.g., up to 10,000 nodes and 100,000 edges).
*   The number of attributes can vary.
*   The maximum chain length `K` can be up to 10.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient, considering the graph size and the need to explore multiple paths.  Brute-force approaches are likely to be too slow.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: [4, 5]}
user_attributes = {
    1: {'age': 25, 'influence_score': 0.8},
    2: {'age': 30, 'influence_score': 0.9},
    3: {'age': 27, 'influence_score': 0.75},
    4: {'age': 29, 'influence_score': 0.88},
    5: {'age': 31, 'influence_score': 0.92}
}
user_reach = {1: 1000, 2: 2000, 3: 1500, 4: 3000, 5: 2500}
target_audience_profile = {'age': 28, 'influence_score': 0.85}
max_attribute_values = {'age': 100, 'influence_score': 1.0}
seed_user_id = 1
K = 3
Lambda = 0.5

# Expected Output (could vary slightly depending on the precise implementation):
# [1, 3, 4]
# Explanation: Path Reach = 1000 + 1500 + 3000 = 5500
# Average Attribute Distance = (|25-28| + |0.8-0.85| + |27-28| + |0.75-0.85| + |29-28| + |0.88-0.85|)/3 = (3 + 0.05 + 1 + 0.1 + 1 + 0.03)/3 = 5.18/3 = 1.73
# Optimization Metric = 5500 - 0.5 * 1.73 = 5499.13
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must return a valid path starting from the seed user, and the returned path must not exceed length K.
*   **Optimality:** The solution should find a path that maximizes the optimization metric.  The solution will be compared to other submissions, and the submission with the highest metric score will be considered the best.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must be able to handle large graphs and relatively tight time constraints.
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** The solution should handle cases where no valid path exists, attributes are missing, or the graph is disconnected.

This problem requires careful consideration of graph traversal algorithms, attribute distance calculations, and optimization techniques to achieve a high score. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Python programming competition problem designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level, incorporating various complexities and optimization requirements.

**Problem Title: Optimal Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal delivery route plan for a logistics company operating in a large city. The company has multiple depots strategically located throughout the city, each with a limited number of vehicles and a finite capacity for packages. Your goal is to minimize the total travel distance while fulfilling all delivery requests, considering time windows and vehicle capacity.

**Specifically:**

*   **Input:**
    *   `depots`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a depot and contains: `(depot_id, capacity, vehicles, location)`.
        *   `depot_id`: A unique integer identifier for the depot.
        *   `capacity`: The total package capacity of the depot.
        *   `vehicles`: The number of vehicles available at the depot.
        *   `location`: A tuple `(x, y)` representing the depot's coordinates in the city (integers).
    *   `delivery_requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a delivery request and contains: `(request_id, package_size, time_window, location)`.
        *   `request_id`: A unique integer identifier for the delivery request.
        *   `package_size`: The size of the package to be delivered (integer).
        *   `time_window`: A tuple `(start_time, end_time)` representing the acceptable delivery window (integers, representing minutes from the start of the planning horizon).
        *   `location`: A tuple `(x, y)` representing the delivery location's coordinates in the city (integers).
    *   `distance_matrix`: A 2D array where `distance_matrix[i][j]` represents the Euclidean distance between location `i` and location `j`.  The locations are indexed as follows:
        *   The first `len(depots)` indices represent the depot locations, in the order they appear in the `depots` list.
        *   The subsequent `len(delivery_requests)` indices represent the delivery request locations, in the order they appear in the `delivery_requests` list.
    *   `vehicle_speed`: An integer representing the average speed of the vehicles (km/minute). The distance matrix is in kilometers.
    *   `service_time`: An integer representing the time (in minutes) it takes to deliver a package at a delivery location. This time is constant for all deliveries.

*   **Constraints:**

    *   **Capacity Constraint:** Each vehicle has a maximum capacity equal to the depot's capacity. The sum of `package_size` for deliveries assigned to a vehicle cannot exceed this capacity.
    *   **Time Window Constraint:** Each delivery must be made within its specified `time_window`. A vehicle cannot arrive at a delivery location before `start_time` or after `end_time`.
    *   **Depot Constraint:** Each vehicle must start and end its route at the same depot.
    *   **Vehicle Limit:** The number of routes originating from each depot cannot exceed the number of available vehicles at that depot.
    *   **All Deliveries Must Be Served:** Every delivery request in the `delivery_requests` list must be assigned to a vehicle and delivered.
    *   **Euclidean Distance**: The distance between two points is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.

*   **Objective:**

    Minimize the total travel distance across all vehicles.

*   **Output:**

    A list of lists, where each inner list represents a vehicle route. Each vehicle route should be a list of `request_id`s (integers) in the order they are visited, starting and ending at the `depot_id`.  For example: `[[1, 3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6, 4]]` means vehicle route 1 from depot 1 does delivery request 1, 3, 2 and returns to depot 1. The vehicle route 2 from depot 4 does delivery request 4, 5, 6 and returns to depot 4.

*   **Optimization Requirements:**

    *   The solution must be reasonably efficient (polynomial time is desirable, though finding the absolute optimal solution might be NP-hard, so focus on good heuristics).
    *   Consider the trade-offs between different optimization strategies (e.g., greedy algorithms, local search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, etc.).
    *   Pay attention to data structures and algorithm choices to minimize computational cost.

*   **Edge Cases and Considerations:**

    *   Empty `delivery_requests` list.
    *   Single depot and single vehicle.
    *   Delivery requests clustered in specific areas of the city.
    *   Time windows that are very tight or overlapping.
    *   Depots with very limited capacity or few vehicles.

*   **Constraints on your code:**

    *   Your code must run in under 60 seconds for reasonable size inputs (e.g., 10 depots, 100 delivery requests).
    *   Your code should have minimal external dependencies (standard Python libraries are fine).

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, optimization techniques, and careful handling of constraints. Good luck!

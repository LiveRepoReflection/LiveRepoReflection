Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging problem. Here's the problem description:

## Problem: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Simulation with Transaction Rollbacks

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified simulation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that manages a shared fund. The DAO operates on a blockchain-like system where transactions are grouped into blocks. Each block contains a sequence of proposals (transactions) that are executed in order. A majority vote is required for a proposal to be included in the block.

However, due to unforeseen circumstances or malicious proposals, a block might be deemed invalid *after* it has been processed. In such cases, the entire block must be rolled back, effectively reverting all transactions within that block. The DAO must maintain a consistent state throughout these rollbacks.

**Data Structures:**

1.  **Account:** Represents a participant in the DAO. Each account has a unique ID (integer) and a balance (integer).
2.  **Proposal:** Represents a transaction proposed within the DAO. Each proposal has:
    *   `proposer_id`: The ID of the account proposing the transaction.
    *   `recipient_id`: The ID of the account receiving the transaction.
    *   `amount`: The amount to be transferred.
    *   `votes`: A list of account IDs that voted for the proposal.
3.  **Block:** Represents a block of transactions in the DAO's history. Each block has:
    *   `block_id`: A unique identifier for the block (integer).
    *   `proposals`: A list of `Proposal` objects.
    *   `approvals`: A list of account IDs that approves the block.
4.  **DAO State:** Represents the current state of the DAO, including all accounts and their balances, and current blocks.

**Functionality:**

You need to implement the following functions:

1.  `create_account(dao_state, account_id, initial_balance)`: Creates a new account in the DAO with the given ID and initial balance. Return `False` if account_id already exists.
2.  `create_proposal(dao_state, proposer_id, recipient_id, amount)`: Creates a new proposal to transfer `amount` from `proposer_id` to `recipient_id`. Return the new proposal object.
3.  `vote_on_proposal(proposal, voter_id)`: Adds a vote from `voter_id` to the given proposal.
4.  `create_block(dao_state, block_id, proposals)`: Creates a new block with the given ID and list of proposals.  Return `False` if block_id already exists.
5.  `approve_block(block, approver_id)`: Adds an approval from `approver_id` to the given block.
6.  `process_block(dao_state, block)`: Processes the given block. For each proposal in the block:
    *   Check if the proposal has a majority vote (more than 50% of the accounts in the DAO have voted for it).
    *   If it has a majority, transfer the `amount` from the proposer's account to the recipient's account.
    *   If the proposer does not have enough funds, the proposal is considered invalid and the function should return `False` without applying any transactions in the block.
    *   If a proposal's proposer or recipient account_id is not found in the dao_state, the proposal is considered invalid and the function should return `False` without applying any transactions in the block.
7.  `rollback_block(dao_state, block_id)`: Rolls back the block with the given ID. This means:
    *   Revert all transactions that were applied in that block, restoring the account balances to their state *before* the block was processed.
    *   Remove the block from the DAO's history.
    *   If the block_id does not exist, return `False`.

**Constraints:**

*   The DAO can have a large number of accounts (up to 10,000).
*   Blocks can contain a large number of proposals (up to 1,000).
*   Transaction amounts can be large (up to 1,000,000).
*   Rollbacks should be efficient, even after many blocks have been processed.
*   Ensure that the DAO state remains consistent even after multiple rollbacks.
*   Account IDs are unique and are non-negative integers.
*   Balances are non-negative integers.
*   The number of votes required for a proposal depends on the number of registered accounts in the DAO *at the time the block is processed*.
*   If a rollback occurs, the approvals should also be rolled back.
*   If the dao_state or blocks are invalid, return `False`.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the time complexity of `rollback_block`.  Consider using appropriate data structures to efficiently revert transactions.
*   Minimize memory usage. Avoid storing redundant data.

**Real-World Scenario:**

This problem simulates a key aspect of DAO governance: the ability to execute transactions based on community consensus and to revert those transactions if they are later found to be harmful or invalid.  Efficient rollback mechanisms are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of a DAO.

**Example:**

```python
dao_state = {"accounts": {}, "blocks": {}}
create_account(dao_state, 1, 100)
create_account(dao_state, 2, 50)

proposal1 = create_proposal(dao_state, 1, 2, 20)
vote_on_proposal(proposal1, 1)
vote_on_proposal(proposal1, 2)

block1 = create_block(dao_state, 1, [proposal1])
approve_block(block1, 1)
approve_block(block1, 2)

process_block(dao_state, block1) # Should execute successfully

print(dao_state["accounts"][1]) # Output: {'balance': 80}
print(dao_state["accounts"][2]) # Output: {'balance': 70}

rollback_block(dao_state, 1) # Should revert block1

print(dao_state["accounts"][1]) # Output: {'balance': 100}
print(dao_state["accounts"][2]) # Output: {'balance': 50}
```

This is a challenging problem that requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. Good luck!

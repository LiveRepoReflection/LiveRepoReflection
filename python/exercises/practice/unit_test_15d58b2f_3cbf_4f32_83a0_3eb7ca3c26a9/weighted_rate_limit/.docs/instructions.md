## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Weighted Fairness

### Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter that enforces limits on user actions across a cluster of servers.  This rate limiter must also provide weighted fairness, ensuring that users with higher priority (weight) receive proportionally more requests.

Specifically, your system must:

1.  **Enforce Rate Limits:** Prevent individual users from exceeding a predefined number of actions (requests) within a given time window.
2.  **Distributed Operation:**  The rate limiter is distributed across multiple servers.  User requests can arrive at any server in the cluster.  The rate limiter must provide consistent rate limiting across the cluster, even with concurrent requests.
3.  **Weighted Fairness:** Allow certain users to have a higher "weight" or priority. A user with weight `w` should be able to perform `w` times more actions than a user with weight `1` within the same time window, assuming enough capacity exists.
4.  **Near Real-time Accuracy:** The rate limiter should be as accurate as possible. However, absolute, perfectly strict rate limiting is not required. Some small burst allowance is acceptable, but should be minimized.

### Input

*   `user_id`: A unique identifier for the user.
*   `action`: The action the user is performing (e.g., "create\_post", "send\_message").
*   `timestamp`: The time the action was performed (in seconds since epoch).
*   `user_weight`:  A positive integer representing the user's weight/priority.
*   `limit`: The base rate limit for a user with weight `1` (requests per second).
*   `window`: The time window over which the rate limit is enforced (in seconds).
*   `server_id`: The ID of the server receiving the request.

### Output

Your solution must implement a function/method that accepts these inputs and returns a boolean:

*   `True`: If the action is allowed (the user is within their rate limit).
*   `False`: If the action is rejected (the user has exceeded their rate limit).

### Constraints and Considerations

1.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of users and requests per second.
2.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent requests from multiple users.
3.  **Storage:** The rate limiter requires some form of persistent storage or in-memory data structure to track user activity. The storage solution must be scalable and efficient. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage, latency, and consistency.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to server failures. Consider how data is replicated and recovered in case of a server outage.
5.  **Efficiency:**  Minimize the latency of the rate limiting check. Aim for a solution that can process a large number of requests with minimal impact on application performance.
6.  **Approximate vs. Strict Fairness:** Prioritize weighted fairness on average over a longer period. Occasional short-term deviations from perfectly proportional access are acceptable, given the distributed nature and complexity.

### Advanced Considerations

*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  Consider how to handle scenarios where user weights need to be updated dynamically.
*   **Throttling vs. Rejection:** Instead of simply rejecting requests, explore the possibility of throttling requests (delaying them) to maintain a more consistent user experience.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Think about the metrics you would need to monitor to ensure the rate limiter is functioning correctly and to detect potential issues.
*   **Different Action Types:** Consider how to handle different actions with different rate limits per action type.

This problem is designed to assess your ability to design and implement a complex, distributed system with specific performance and scalability requirements. Good luck!

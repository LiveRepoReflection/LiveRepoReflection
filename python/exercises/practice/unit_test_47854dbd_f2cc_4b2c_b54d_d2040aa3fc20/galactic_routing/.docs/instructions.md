Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a wide range of skills:

**Project Name:** Intergalactic Network Routing

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a new intergalactic communication network. This network connects `N` planets (numbered 0 to N-1) across multiple star systems. Due to the vast distances involved and the presence of unstable wormholes, the network's topology and link characteristics are highly dynamic.

**Network Structure:**

The network's connectivity is represented by a time-varying graph. You will receive a series of events, each describing changes to the network's links. A link between two planets is characterized by its *latency*, *bandwidth*, and *stability*.

*   **Latency:** The time (in milliseconds) it takes for a signal to travel across the link. Latency can fluctuate due to gravitational lensing and other space phenomena.
*   **Bandwidth:** The maximum data transfer rate (in megabits per second) the link can support.
*   **Stability:** A probability (between 0.0 and 1.0) that the link remains operational during a given time window.  A link with a stability of 0.0 is essentially non-existent.  A link with a stability of 1.0 is perfectly reliable.

**Events:**

The input will consist of a series of events, which can be of the following types:

1.  **`ADD_LINK u v latency bandwidth stability`**: Creates a new link between planets `u` and `v` with the specified `latency`, `bandwidth`, and `stability`. If a link already exists between `u` and `v`, this event *updates* its properties.  The link is bidirectional.
2.  **`REMOVE_LINK u v`**: Removes the link between planets `u` and `v`. This removes the link in both directions.
3.  **`QUERY_ROUTE source destination data_size deadline`**:  This is a routing request. You must determine the "best" route to send a message of `data_size` (in megabits) from `source` to `destination` before the specified `deadline` (in milliseconds). The route's quality is a combined metric of latency, bandwidth, and stability.

**Routing Metric:**

The "best" route is determined by optimizing the following criteria, in order of priority:

1.  **Feasibility:** The message *must* arrive before the `deadline`.  If no route can deliver the message before the deadline, return "NO_ROUTE".
2.  **Stability:** Maximize the *overall* stability of the route. The overall stability of a route is the *product* of the stabilities of all links in the route.
3.  **Bandwidth:** Maximize the *minimum* bandwidth of any link in the route.  This ensures the route can support the required data transfer.
4.  **Latency:** Minimize the *total* latency of the route.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of planets)
*   `0 <= u, v < N` (Planet indices)
*   `1 <= latency <= 100` (milliseconds)
*   `1 <= bandwidth <= 1000` (megabits per second)
*   `0.0 <= stability <= 1.0`
*   `1 <= data_size <= 1000` (megabits)
*   `1 <= deadline <= 10000` (milliseconds)
*   The number of events can be up to `10000`.
*   All floating-point numbers should be treated with appropriate precision to avoid rounding errors.
*   You can assume that there is at most one link between any two planets at any given time.
*   The network is not guaranteed to be connected.
*   The graph changes *between* queries, so pre-computation is of limited use.

**Output:**

For each `QUERY_ROUTE` event, output either:

*   `NO_ROUTE` if no feasible route exists.
*   A space-separated list of planet indices representing the optimal route (including the source and destination planets). For example: `0 1 2 3`.

**Example:**

```
ADD_LINK 0 1 50 500 0.9
ADD_LINK 1 2 30 400 0.8
ADD_LINK 0 2 80 300 0.7
QUERY_ROUTE 0 2 100 200
REMOVE_LINK 0 1
QUERY_ROUTE 0 2 100 200
```

**Expected Output:**

```
0 1 2
0 2
```

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on correctness (passing all test cases) and efficiency (running within the time limit).  Test cases will include various network topologies, event sequences, and routing requests designed to expose weaknesses in suboptimal algorithms. Consider edge cases like disconnected graphs, zero stability links, and very tight deadlines.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a modified version of Dijkstra's or A\* algorithm.  You'll need to adapt the distance metric to incorporate stability and bandwidth.
*   Think about how to efficiently update the graph representation after each `ADD_LINK` or `REMOVE_LINK` event.
*   Be mindful of floating-point precision when calculating the overall stability of a route.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

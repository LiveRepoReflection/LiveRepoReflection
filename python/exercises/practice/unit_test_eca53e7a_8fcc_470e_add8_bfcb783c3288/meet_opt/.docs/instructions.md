## Project Name

`OptimalMeetingScheduler`

## Question Description

You are tasked with developing an optimal meeting scheduler for a company with a complex organizational structure and global presence. The company has employees spread across various time zones and departments. The scheduler needs to find the best possible time slots for meetings, considering several constraints and optimization goals.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following data:

1.  **Employee Data:** A list of employees, each with the following information:
    *   `employee_id` (unique integer): A unique identifier for the employee.
    *   `department_id` (integer): The ID of the department the employee belongs to.
    *   `timezone` (string): The employee's timezone (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles", "Europe/London", "Asia/Tokyo").  You can assume all timezones are valid and understood by `pytz`.
    *   `availability` (list of tuples): A list of time intervals when the employee is available for meetings. Each tuple represents a time interval as (`start_datetime`, `end_datetime`), where both datetimes are strings in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-11-16T09:00:00+00:00").

2.  **Department Data:** A list of departments, each with the following information:
    *   `department_id` (unique integer): A unique identifier for the department.
    *   `required_attendees` (integer): The minimum number of employees from this department that must attend the meeting.

3.  **Meeting Duration:** An integer representing the desired duration of the meeting in minutes.

4.  **Time Window:** A tuple representing the overall time window for the meeting search, as (`start_datetime`, `end_datetime`), where both datetimes are strings in ISO 8601 format.

5.  **Optional Parameters:**
    * `priority_attendees` (list of integers): A list of `employee_id`s that are high-priority and ideally need to be in the meeting.  If not possible, still schedule the meeting.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Time Zone Conversion:** All availability times are given in the employee's local timezone.  You must convert all times to UTC for comparison and scheduling.
2.  **Department Representation:**  The meeting must have at least the `required_attendees` number of participants from each department.
3.  **Meeting Duration:** The scheduled meeting time must be exactly the specified `meeting_duration`.
4.  **Time Window:** The meeting must start and end within the given `time_window`.
5.  **Availability:** All attendees must be available for the entire duration of the meeting.
6.  **Maximum Attendees:** Aim to have as few meeting participants as possible while satisfying all other conditions.

**Optimization Goal:**

1.  **Minimize Attendees:** The primary optimization goal is to minimize the number of employees required to attend the meeting, while adhering to all constraints.
2. **Priority Attendees:** If possible, include all the `priority_attendees` without violating the constraints. However, the program should still schedule a meeting even if it's impossible to include all priority attendees.
3.  **Earliest Possible Time:** If multiple meeting times satisfy all constraints and the optimization goal, choose the earliest possible start time in UTC.

**Output:**

The function should return a list of `employee_id`s representing the optimal set of attendees for the meeting, sorted in ascending order. If no meeting time can be found that satisfies all constraints, return an empty list.

**Example:**

Let's say we have two departments. One with `required_attendees=1` and another with `required_attendees=2`. The solution must find a meeting time where at least one employee from the first department and at least two employees from the second department are available simultaneously within the given `time_window`. The function should return a list containing the smallest number of `employee_id`s which make the meeting possible given the availability constraints.

**Note:**

*   Assume that input data is valid and well-formatted.
*   You can use the `pytz` library for timezone conversions.
*   Consider edge cases such as empty employee lists, departments with no required attendees, and time windows that are too short to accommodate the meeting duration.
*   The efficiency of your solution will be evaluated.  Brute-force approaches may not be feasible for larger datasets.
*   This problem requires a combination of data structure selection, algorithmic thinking, and careful handling of time zones. It encourages exploring different optimization strategies and analyzing trade-offs between them.

Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a programmer's skills with graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world application.

**Project Name:** `OptimalRideSharing`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building the core routing engine for a new ride-sharing service called "OptimalRide."  OptimalRide aims to minimize the total travel time for all passengers by intelligently grouping riders with similar destinations and optimizing routes in real-time.

You are given a directed graph representing the city's road network.  Each node in the graph represents a location (e.g., an intersection, a building). Each directed edge represents a road segment with an associated travel time (in minutes).

You are also given a list of ride requests. Each ride request consists of:

*   A start location (node ID).
*   An end location (node ID).
*   A maximum acceptable detour factor.  A detour factor of 1.0 means the passenger is willing to travel no more than 1.0 times the shortest path from their start to end. A detour factor of 1.5 means the passenger is willing to travel no more than 1.5 times the shortest path from their start to end.

Your task is to design an algorithm that efficiently groups ride requests into shared rides and determines the optimal route for each shared ride to minimize the total travel time of all passengers *while respecting their maximum detour factor*.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The city's road network can be large (up to 10,000 nodes and 50,000 edges). The travel times on edges are positive integers.

2.  **Ride Requests:** The number of ride requests can be significant (up to 1,000 requests).

3.  **Detour Factor:**  The detour factor must be strictly adhered to.  A passenger should never experience a detour exceeding this factor relative to their individual shortest path.

4.  **Objective:** Minimize the *sum* of the actual travel times experienced by all passengers.  This includes any detours resulting from the shared ride. If a passenger cannot be accommodated without exceeding their detour factor, they should be routed directly (without sharing) using the shortest path.

5.  **Real-time Considerations:** While the problem is static, the algorithm should be designed with real-time performance in mind. Aim for reasonable efficiency.

6.  **Edge Cases:**

    *   Handle disconnected graphs. Some locations might be unreachable from others.
    *   Handle ride requests where the start and end locations are the same.
    *   Handle ride requests where no path exists between the start and end locations.
    *   Handle cases with conflicting requests which makes it impossible to group all of them.

7.  **Algorithm Complexity:** The core routing algorithm should be reasonably efficient. Bruteforce solutions will likely time out. Consider graph search algorithms and optimization techniques.

8.  **Output:**  Your function should return a data structure describing the route for each rider. It should specify whether they rode alone or shared, the total travel time experienced, and the route taken (list of node IDs). In case of shared ride, the function should return the ID of other riders.

9.  **Optimization:**  The judge will test against multiple datasets with varying graph sizes, request numbers, and detour factors. Solutions must demonstrate effective optimization to achieve good scores on these datasets. Consider time and memory complexity.

10. **Multiple Solutions:** There can be multiple optimal solutions. The judge will take any correct optimal solution.

This question will test your ability to:

*   Model a real-world problem using graph data structures.
*   Apply efficient graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path algorithms).
*   Design an optimization strategy for ride-sharing.
*   Handle edge cases and constraints effectively.
*   Implement a solution with reasonable performance.

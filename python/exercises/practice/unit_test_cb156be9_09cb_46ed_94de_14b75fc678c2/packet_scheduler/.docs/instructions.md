Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated, incorporating several elements you requested.

**Problem Title:** Network Packet Prioritization and Scheduling

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a network router responsible for handling incoming packets and forwarding them to their destinations. Each packet has a priority and a deadline. The router has limited processing capacity and must schedule packets to maximize throughput while minimizing the number of packets that miss their deadlines.

Specifically, you are given a list of packets. Each packet `i` has the following attributes:

*   `arrival_time[i]`: The time at which the packet arrives at the router (non-negative integer).
*   `priority[i]`: An integer representing the priority of the packet (higher value indicates higher priority).
*   `deadline[i]`: The time by which the packet must be processed and forwarded (non-negative integer, always greater than `arrival_time[i]`).
*   `processing_time[i]`: An integer representing the time required to process and forward the packet (positive integer).

The router can process only one packet at a time. Once a packet's processing starts, it cannot be interrupted.  A packet is considered "missed" if its processing is not completed by its deadline.

Your task is to implement a scheduling algorithm that determines the order in which the packets are processed to maximize the total priority of packets that meet their deadlines. In case multiple schedules results in the same total priority, choose the schedule that minimizes the number of missed packets.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following lists, all of the same length `n`:

*   `arrival_time`: A list of integers representing the arrival times of the packets.
*   `priority`: A list of integers representing the priorities of the packets.
*   `deadline`: A list of integers representing the deadlines of the packets.
*   `processing_time`: A list of integers representing the processing times of the packets.

**Output:**

Return a list of integers representing the *indices* (0-based) of the packets in the order they should be processed to maximize the total priority of on-time packets, and in the case of ties minimize the number of missed deadlines.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= arrival_time[i] <= 10000`
*   `1 <= priority[i] <= 100`
*   `arrival_time[i] < deadline[i] <= 100000`
*   `1 <= processing_time[i] <= 1000`
*   All input lists have the same length.
*   All arrival times, priorities, deadlines, and processing times are valid integers.

**Example:**

```
arrival_time = [0, 1, 2, 3]
priority = [10, 5, 8, 2]
deadline = [10, 5, 12, 6]
processing_time = [3, 2, 4, 1]

Output: [3, 1, 0, 2]
```

**Explanation:**

One possible schedule is to process packet 3 first (arrives at 3, processed in 1 unit of time, completes at 4, meets deadline of 6), then packet 1 (arrives at 1, processed in 2 units of time, completes at 6, meets deadline of 5 - MISSED), then packet 0 (arrives at 0, processed in 3 units of time, completes at 9, meets deadline of 10), and finally packet 2 (arrives at 2, processed in 4 units of time, completes at 13, meets deadline of 12 - MISSED).
Packets 3 and 0 meet their deadlines, total priority is 10 + 2 = 12, missed packets = 2.

Another possible schedule is processing packet 3 (arrives at 3, processed in 1 unit of time, completes at 4, meets deadline of 6), then packet 1 (arrives at 1, processed in 2 units of time, completes at 6, meets deadline of 5 - MISSED), then packet 2 (arrives at 2, processed in 4 units of time, completes at 10, meets deadline of 12), and finally packet 0 (arrives at 0, processed in 3 units of time, completes at 13, meets deadline of 10 - MISSED).
Packets 3 and 2 meet their deadlines, total priority is 8 + 2 = 10, missed packets = 2.

The optimal schedule is processing packet 3 (arrives at 3, processed in 1 unit of time, completes at 4, meets deadline of 6), then packet 1 (arrives at 1, processed in 2 units of time, completes at 6, meets deadline of 5 - MISSED), then packet 0 (arrives at 0, processed in 3 units of time, completes at 9, meets deadline of 10), then packet 2 (arrives at 2, processed in 4 units of time, completes at 13, meets deadline of 12 - MISSED).
Packets 3 and 0 meet their deadlines, total priority is 10 + 2 = 12, missed packets = 2.

A better optimal schedule is processing packet 3 (arrives at 3, processed in 1 unit of time, completes at 4, meets deadline of 6), then packet 1 (arrives at 1, processed in 2 units of time, completes at 6, meets deadline of 5 - MISSED), then packet 2 (arrives at 2, processed in 4 units of time, completes at 10, meets deadline of 12), then packet 0 (arrives at 0, processed in 3 units of time, completes at 13, meets deadline of 10 - MISSED).
Packets 3 and 2 meet their deadlines, total priority is 8 + 2 = 10, missed packets = 2.

The optimal schedule is processing packet 3, then 1, then 0, then 2. Packets 3 and 0 are processed successfully, totaling priority = 12 and 2 packets are missed.

**Remarks:**

*   This problem requires careful consideration of packet scheduling strategies, including but not limited to shortest deadline first, highest priority first, and combinations thereof.
*   Brute-force approaches (checking all permutations) might work for small `n`, but will time out for larger test cases.
*   Dynamic programming or greedy algorithms with appropriate tie-breaking strategies are likely needed for an efficient solution.
*   The problem encourages thinking about real-world system design considerations, such as resource constraints and optimization goals.
*   The tie-breaking requirement (minimizing missed packets) adds another layer of complexity.

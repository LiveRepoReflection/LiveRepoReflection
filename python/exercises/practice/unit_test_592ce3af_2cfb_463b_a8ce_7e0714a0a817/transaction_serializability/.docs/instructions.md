Okay, here's a challenging problem designed to test a candidate's understanding of graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world application:

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Validation

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you are building a distributed database system. Transactions are submitted to different nodes in the system. Each transaction modifies data items (represented as strings). To ensure data consistency, the system needs to validate whether transactions can be applied in a serializable order.

You are given:

*   `num_nodes`: The number of nodes in the system (nodes are numbered from 0 to `num_nodes` - 1).
*   `transactions`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a transaction: `(node_id, [data_items_read], [data_items_written])`.
    *   `node_id`: The ID of the node where the transaction originated.
    *   `data_items_read`: A list of strings representing the data items read by the transaction.
    *   `data_items_written`: A list of strings representing the data items written by the transaction.  It is guaranteed that each data item is written by at most one transaction within the input set of transactions.

Your task is to determine if there exists a serializable execution order of the given transactions.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `num_nodes` <= 100
*   1 <= Number of transactions <= 500
*   1 <= Length of `data_items_read` and `data_items_written` lists <= 100
*   The length of each data item string is between 1 and 10.
* The same data item can appear in both read and write.

**Input:**

*   `num_nodes`: An integer.
*   `transactions`: A list of tuples as described above.

**Output:**

*   `True` if there exists a serializable execution order, `False` otherwise.

**Example:**

```python
num_nodes = 2
transactions = [
    (0, ["A"], ["B"]),
    (1, ["B"], ["C"]),
    (0, ["C"], ["D"])
]

# Possible schedule: T1 -> T2 -> T3
# Output: True

num_nodes = 2
transactions = [
    (0, ["A"], ["B"]),
    (1, ["B"], ["A"])
]

# No possible schedule due to circular dependency
# Output: False

num_nodes = 2
transactions = [
    (0, ["A"], ["B"]),
    (1, ["C"], ["D"]),
    (0, ["B"], ["C"])
]

# Possible schedule: T1 -> T3 -> T2
# Output: True
```

**Complexity Expectations:**

A brute-force solution (checking all possible permutations) will likely time out for larger inputs.  An efficient solution should have a time complexity better than O(n!), where n is the number of transactions.  Consider using graph algorithms and cycle detection techniques to achieve this. You should aim for a solution with a time complexity of O(n^2) or better where n is the number of transactions.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must accurately determine if a serializable order exists for all valid inputs.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be efficient enough to handle inputs within the specified constraints within a reasonable time limit.  Solutions that time out will not be accepted.
*   Code Clarity: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

**Notes:**

*   A serializable execution order means that the transactions can be executed one after another (in some order) without violating data consistency.
*   The problem can be modeled as a directed graph where nodes represent transactions, and edges represent dependencies (e.g., a transaction T1 reads a data item that transaction T2 writes, creating a dependency from T2 to T1). A cycle in this graph indicates a non-serializable schedule.
*   You should handle edge cases carefully, such as empty transaction lists and transactions with empty read/write sets.

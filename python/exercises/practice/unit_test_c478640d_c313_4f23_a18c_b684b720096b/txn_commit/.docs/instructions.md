Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated, focusing on algorithmic efficiency, data structures, and real-world constraints.

### Question Description

You are designing a distributed database system. A crucial component is the transaction commit protocol, ensuring atomicity across multiple nodes. Implement a highly efficient and reliable decentralized two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**System Setup:**

*   You have `N` database nodes (where `1 <= N <= 1000`). Each node stores a part of the overall data.
*   A transaction involves modifying data across a subset of these nodes.
*   One node is designated as the **coordinator** for each transaction. Any node can be the coordinator.
*   All other nodes involved in the transaction are **participants**.
*   Communication between nodes is asynchronous and potentially unreliable. Messages can be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order.
*   Each node has a persistent log to record its actions.
*   Network latency between nodes is variable but generally low (assume messages are delivered within a reasonable timeframe if not lost).
*   Nodes can fail independently and recover later.

**The Task:**

Implement the 2PC protocol with the following requirements:

1.  **Atomicity:** Ensure that a transaction either commits on all involved nodes or aborts on all involved nodes, even in the face of node failures or message loss.
2.  **Durability:** Once a transaction commits, the changes must be permanently stored on all involved nodes and survive node failures.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The protocol should handle node failures during any phase of the commit process.  Recovering nodes should be able to determine the outcome of in-flight transactions.
4.  **Efficiency:** Minimize the number of messages exchanged and the time required to complete the commit process. Aim for optimal performance, especially for transactions involving a large number of nodes.
5.  **Decentralization**: There is no central trusted authority, the coordinator role can be taken by any node.
6.  **Scalability**: The solution should be able to handle a large number of transactions concurrently.

**Constraints:**

*   You must handle message loss, duplication, and out-of-order delivery.
*   Your solution must avoid blocking indefinitely in case of node failures. Implement appropriate timeouts and recovery mechanisms.
*   Each node has limited resources (memory, CPU).  Optimize your implementation to minimize resource consumption.
*   Assume a reliable clock is available on each node to implement timeouts.

**Input:**

The input will be a series of transactions. Each transaction specifies:

*   The ID of the coordinator node.
*   A list of participant node IDs.
*   A unique transaction ID.
*   The data to be modified (this can be a placeholder; the focus is on the commit protocol).

**Output:**

For each transaction, your solution should output (to a log or standard output) the final outcome (COMMIT or ABORT) on each involved node. The output must be consistent across all nodes.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Does the protocol reliably achieve atomicity and durability under all failure scenarios?
*   **Performance:**  How quickly does the protocol complete commits under normal conditions and under simulated failures?  Measure message count and overall completion time.
*   **Resource Consumption:**  How much memory and CPU does the protocol use on each node?
*   **Scalability:**  How well does the protocol perform as the number of nodes and transactions increases?
*   **Code Quality:**  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, including 2PC, fault tolerance, message passing, and concurrency. A successful solution will involve careful design, efficient implementation, and thorough testing to handle all possible failure scenarios. Good luck!

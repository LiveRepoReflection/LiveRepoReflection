## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager (DTM) for a system that involves multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.). The goal is to ensure atomicity and consistency across these services when performing a complex operation that requires interacting with several of them.

Imagine you are building an e-commerce platform. When a user places an order, the following steps need to happen in a transactional manner:

1.  Reserve the required quantity of items from the `InventoryService`.
2.  Create an order record in the `OrderService`.
3.  Initiate a payment with the `PaymentService`.
4.  Publish a message to a `NotificationService` to send an order confirmation email.

If any of these steps fail, the entire operation must be rolled back, meaning any changes made in the previous steps must be undone to maintain data consistency.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **Transaction Coordination:** Implement a central DTM component that coordinates the transaction across multiple services.
*   **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:** Implement the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity. This involves a *prepare* phase and a *commit/rollback* phase.
*   **Service Interaction:** Design interfaces for services to register with the DTM and participate in transactions.  Services need to expose `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` operations.
*   **Concurrency:** The DTM must handle multiple concurrent transactions.
*   **Failure Handling:**  The DTM needs to handle service failures (e.g., a service becomes unavailable during the transaction). Implement a timeout mechanism for prepare requests. If a service doesn't respond within the timeout, consider it failed and initiate a rollback.
*   **Idempotency:**  Assume that prepare, commit, and rollback operations might be called multiple times on the same service.  Ensure that the services handle these operations idempotently (i.e., calling the operation multiple times has the same effect as calling it once).
*   **Logging:** Implement logging to record the state of transactions and service interactions for debugging and recovery purposes.
*   **Optimization:**  Consider potential optimizations to improve performance, such as asynchronous communication between the DTM and the services where applicable.
*   **Scalability:**  While not a primary focus for the implementation, consider how the DTM architecture could be scaled to handle a large number of services and transactions.
*   **Resource locking:** The system must be able to handle resource locking appropriately. Design the DTM with logic that can timeout locks if they are held for extended periods.

**Constraints:**

*   **Simplified Services:** You don't need to implement actual `InventoryService`, `OrderService`, `PaymentService`, and `NotificationService`. You can simulate their behavior with simplified classes that expose the necessary `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods. Focus on the DTM logic and the interaction with these simulated services.
*   **No External Dependencies:** You are **NOT** allowed to use external libraries or frameworks specifically designed for distributed transaction management (e.g., JTA, XA). The purpose of this exercise is to understand the underlying concepts and implement the 2PC protocol from scratch.  However, you are free to use standard Python libraries for threading, logging, and data structures.
*   **Focus on Core Logic:** Prioritize implementing the core DTM logic and the 2PC protocol correctly. Don't spend excessive time on aspects like UI or advanced monitoring.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging to provide insights into transaction execution and potential failures.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the DTM correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity and consistency?
*   **Concurrency Handling:** Does the DTM handle concurrent transactions without race conditions or deadlocks?
*   **Failure Handling:** Does the DTM gracefully handle service failures and timeouts?
*   **Idempotency:** Are the service interactions idempotent?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the DTM reasonably efficient in terms of resource utilization and transaction latency?
*   **Scalability considerations:** Show in your comments how you would design to handle a large number of services and transactions.

This problem is intentionally open-ended to allow for different design choices and approaches. The challenge lies in implementing a robust and efficient DTM from scratch, understanding the nuances of the 2PC protocol, and handling the complexities of distributed systems.

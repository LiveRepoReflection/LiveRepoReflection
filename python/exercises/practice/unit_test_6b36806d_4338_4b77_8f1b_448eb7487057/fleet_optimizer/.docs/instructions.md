## Question: Optimal Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Management

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a system to manage a fleet of autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating within a city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments connecting them. Each road segment has a time-varying congestion profile, affecting the travel time along that segment. The goal is to efficiently route AVs from their origins to their destinations while minimizing a combination of travel time, energy consumption, and overall system congestion.

**Input:**

1.  **City Graph:** A directed graph represented as an adjacency list. Each node (intersection) is identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`, where `N` is the total number of intersections. Each edge is represented as a tuple `(destination_node, base_travel_time, energy_consumption_rate)`.
    *   `destination_node`: The ID of the intersection the road segment leads to.
    *   `base_travel_time`: The base travel time (in seconds) along the road segment in ideal conditions.
    *   `energy_consumption_rate`: The energy consumption rate (in Joules per second) for traversing this segment under ideal conditions.

    For example:

    ```python
    city_graph = {
        0: [(1, 60, 5), (2, 120, 3)],  # Intersection 0 connects to 1 and 2
        1: [(3, 90, 4)],
        2: [(3, 60, 2)],
        3: []
    }
    ```

2.  **Congestion Profile:** A function `congestion_factor(start_node, end_node, time)` that takes the start node, end node of a road segment, and the time (in seconds since the start of the simulation) as input. It returns a congestion factor (a float >= 1.0) that multiplies both the `base_travel_time` and `energy_consumption_rate` for that road segment at that given time. Higher congestion factors indicate slower travel and higher energy consumption.

    ```python
    def congestion_factor(start_node, end_node, time):
        # Example (linear increase in congestion with time)
        return 1.0 + (time / 3600.0) # congestion increases over time
    ```

3.  **AV Requests:** A list of AV requests. Each request is a tuple `(origin_node, destination_node, departure_time, priority)`.
    *   `origin_node`: The ID of the intersection where the AV starts.
    *   `destination_node`: The ID of the intersection where the AV needs to go.
    *   `departure_time`: The time (in seconds since the start of the simulation) when the AV should start its journey.
    *   `priority`: An integer representing the priority of the request (higher values indicate higher priority).

    For example:

    ```python
    av_requests = [
        (0, 3, 0, 5),  # Start at intersection 0, go to 3, depart at time 0, priority 5
        (1, 2, 600, 2), # Start at intersection 1, go to 2, depart at time 600, priority 2
        (2, 3, 1200, 8) # Start at intersection 2, go to 3, depart at time 1200, priority 8
    ]
    ```

4.  **Resource Limits:**
    *   `max_avs`: The maximum number of autonomous vehicles that can be active in the system concurrently.
    *   `total_energy_budget`: The total energy consumption budget (in Joules) for all AVs combined during the simulation.

**Output:**

A list of routes for each AV request, or `None` if a feasible set of routes cannot be found within the resource limits. Each route is a list of node IDs representing the path the AV should take. Your solution must satisfy the AV request and satisfy Resource Limits.

For example:

```python
[
    [0, 1, 3],  # Route for the first AV request
    [1, 3, 2],  # Route for the second AV request
    [2, 3]     # Route for the third AV request
]
```

**Constraints:**

1.  **Graph Size:** The number of intersections `N` can be up to 500.
2.  **Number of Requests:** The number of AV requests can be up to 200.
3.  **Simulation Time:** The simulation time can run up to 3600 seconds.
4.  **Non-Negative Values:** All travel times, energy consumption rates, and departure times are non-negative integers.
5.  **Feasibility:** It's possible that not all requests can be fulfilled within the resource limits.
6.  **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the weighted sum of:
    *   Total travel time for all AVs.
    *   Total energy consumption for all AVs.
    *   Total waiting time of high-priority AVs (waiting time = actual departure time - requested departure time, only for requests with priority >= 7).

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** Whether the generated routes are valid paths in the graph and satisfy all constraints.
2.  **Feasibility:** Whether the solution remains within the specified `max_avs` and `total_energy_budget` limits.
3.  **Optimization:** The lower the weighted sum of total travel time, total energy consumption, and high-priority waiting time, the better.  (The exact weights for these components will be provided during the final evaluation).
4.  **Efficiency:** The runtime of your algorithm. Solutions with significantly longer runtimes will be penalized.

**Hints:**

1.  Consider using A\* search or Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal paths between intersections.
2.  Implement a scheduling mechanism to manage AV deployments and avoid exceeding the `max_avs` limit.
3.  Use a priority queue to handle AV requests based on their priority and arrival time.
4.  Explore approximation algorithms or heuristics to find near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time.
5.  Be mindful of the time complexity of your algorithm, as the input sizes can be significant.
6.  Consider pre-calculating some information about the graph to speed up pathfinding.
7.  Dynamic programming might be useful in optimizing the allocation of the energy budget.

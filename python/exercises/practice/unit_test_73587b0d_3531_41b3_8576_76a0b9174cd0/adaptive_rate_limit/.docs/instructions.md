Okay, here's a challenging and sophisticated Python coding problem, designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations.

## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter with Adaptive Throttling

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter for a high-volume API service. This service is deployed across multiple servers (nodes) and needs to enforce rate limits on a per-user basis to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation. The rate limiter must also adapt to varying network conditions and server load to maintain optimal performance.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Counting:** The rate limiter must accurately track API requests across all nodes in the distributed system. It cannot rely on local counters on each server.

2.  **Per-User Rate Limits:** Each user should have a configurable rate limit (e.g., 100 requests per minute). The system should allow setting different rate limits for different users.

3.  **Adaptive Throttling:** The rate limiter should dynamically adjust the rate limits based on the current server load and network latency. If the system is under heavy load or experiencing high latency, the rate limiter should temporarily reduce the rate limits for all users to prevent cascading failures. When the system is stable, the rate limits should gradually return to their configured values.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter must be resilient to node failures. If a node crashes, the rate limiting functionality should continue to operate correctly on the remaining nodes.

5.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter must be highly efficient to minimize the impact on API response times. It should handle a large number of requests with minimal overhead.

6.  **Concurrency:** Your implementation must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple users.

7.  **Configurability:** The system should allow adding and removing users, and modifying their rate limits dynamically.

8.  **Real Time:** The rate limit must be maintained as accurately as possible.

**Input:**

*   `user_id` (string): The unique identifier of the user making the API request.
*   `timestamp` (int): The timestamp of the API request (in seconds since epoch).
*   `current_server_load` (float): A metric representing the current load on the server (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage). Value between 0.0 and 1.0.
*   `network_latency` (float): The average network latency (in milliseconds) between the current node and the central rate limiting service.

**Output:**

*   `bool`: `True` if the request should be allowed (i.e., the user is within their rate limit), `False` if the request should be rejected (i.e., the user has exceeded their rate limit).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of users can be very large (millions).
*   The API service handles a high volume of requests (thousands per second).
*   Network latency between nodes can vary significantly.
*   Node failures are possible.
*   The system must be scalable.
*   Assume you have access to a distributed key-value store (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for storing counters and configuration data. You can abstract the interaction with this store, but clearly describe its role and required operations.
*   Assume you have a monitoring service that provides real-time server load and network latency metrics.

**Considerations:**

*   Choose appropriate data structures for storing rate limits and request counts.
*   Consider using a sliding window algorithm for rate limiting to provide more accurate enforcement over time.
*   Think about how to handle race conditions when updating counters in the distributed key-value store.
*   Design a mechanism for dynamically adjusting rate limits based on server load and network latency.
*   Consider using a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures during periods of high load or latency.

**This problem requires a combination of:**

*   Understanding of distributed systems concepts (consistency, fault tolerance, scalability).
*   Knowledge of data structures and algorithms for rate limiting (e.g., sliding window, token bucket).
*   Ability to design and implement a concurrent and thread-safe system.
*   Experience with distributed key-value stores.
*   Ability to reason about performance and optimize for high throughput and low latency.

This is a very challenging problem that requires careful design and implementation to meet all the requirements. Good luck!

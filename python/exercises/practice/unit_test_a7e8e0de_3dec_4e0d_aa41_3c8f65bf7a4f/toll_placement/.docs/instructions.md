## Question: Optimal Highway Toll Placement

### Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing the placement of toll booths on a highway network to maximize revenue while adhering to certain constraints. The highway network is represented as a weighted undirected graph where nodes represent cities/intersections, and edges represent highway segments connecting them. The weight of each edge represents the length of the highway segment.

**Objective:**

Maximize the total toll revenue generated by placing toll booths on some of the highway segments (edges).

**Constraints:**

1.  **Budget Constraint:** You have a limited budget `B` for building toll booths. Building a toll booth on a highway segment of length `L` costs `C * L`, where `C` is a constant cost factor per unit length.
2.  **Distance Constraint:** To avoid excessive tolling, the minimum distance a driver must travel between any two consecutive toll booths on their route should be at least `D`. This distance is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the highway segments between the two toll booths.
3.  **Profitability Constraint:** Each toll booth must generate revenue to justify its existence. The revenue generated by a toll booth on a segment of length `L` is estimated as `R * L * T`, where `R` is a constant revenue factor per unit length per vehicle and `T` is the estimated daily traffic volume on that segment.
4. **Network Connectivity Constraint:** After toll booths are placed, it must still be possible to travel between any two cities (nodes) on the highway network. If placing a toll booth on an edge would disconnect the graph, you are not allowed to place one there.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of cities/intersections (nodes). Nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, L, T)` represents a highway segment connecting city `u` and city `v` with length `L` and estimated daily traffic volume `T`. Note that the graph is undirected.
*   `B`: The total budget for building toll booths.
*   `C`: The cost factor per unit length for building a toll booth.
*   `R`: The revenue factor per unit length per vehicle.
*   `D`: The minimum distance required between consecutive toll booths.

**Output:**

A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a highway segment on which a toll booth should be placed. The solution should maximize the total toll revenue while satisfying all given constraints. If no toll booths can be placed under the constraints, return an empty list.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 10, 100), (0, 2, 15, 50), (1, 2, 5, 200), (1, 3, 20, 30), (2, 4, 25, 40), (3, 4, 10, 150)]
B = 500
C = 2
R = 1
D = 30
```

Possible Solution (This is just an example; the optimal solution might be different):

```
[(0, 1), (3, 4)]
```

**Assumptions:**

*   All input values are non-negative integers.
*   The graph is connected.
*   There are no self-loops (edges from a node to itself).
*   There is at most one edge between any two nodes.
*   Multiple optimal solutions may exist. Your solution should return any one of them.

**Complexity Expectations:**

The solution should be reasonably efficient. Aim for a solution that can handle graphs with up to 100 nodes and 200 edges within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Consider time complexity when designing your algorithm.

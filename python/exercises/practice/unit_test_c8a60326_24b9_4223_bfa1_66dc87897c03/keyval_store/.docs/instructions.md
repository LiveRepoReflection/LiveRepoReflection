`DistributedKeyValStore`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed key-value store with eventual consistency. The system should be able to handle a large number of read and write requests concurrently, and should be resilient to node failures.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Basic Operations:** Implement `put(key, value)` and `get(key)` operations.  `put(key, value)` should store the `value` associated with the `key`. `get(key)` should retrieve the `value` associated with the `key`. If the key does not exist, `get(key)` should return `None`.

2.  **Distributed Architecture:** The key-value store consists of `N` server nodes.  Assume `N` is fixed at runtime and known to all nodes. Implement a simple consistent hashing scheme to distribute keys across the nodes.  The hash function should distribute keys uniformly.

3.  **Replication:**  To ensure data durability and availability, each key-value pair should be replicated to `R` nodes (where `R <= N`). The `R` nodes should be determined based on the consistent hashing ring, starting with the primary node.

4.  **Eventual Consistency:** Implement a simple versioning mechanism (e.g., using timestamps or vector clocks) to handle concurrent updates to the same key. When a `get(key)` request is received, if multiple versions of the value exist across the `R` replicas, the node should return the value with the *latest* version. Conflicts do *not* need to be resolved.  The latest write always wins.

5.  **Node Failures:** The system should tolerate node failures. When a node is unavailable, reads and writes should still succeed (with eventual consistency) by utilizing the remaining available replicas.

6.  **Concurrency:** The system should handle concurrent read and write requests efficiently.

**Implementation Details:**

*   You can use any in-memory data structure for storing the key-value pairs on each node.
*   Assume a simple network communication mechanism is available (e.g., a simple RPC framework, or direct socket communication).  You do not need to implement the network layer from scratch, but you need to demonstrate how messages are sent between nodes (e.g., using function calls that simulate network communication).
*   Focus on correctness, concurrency, and fault tolerance. Performance optimization is secondary, but code should be reasonably efficient.
*   The number of nodes `N` and the replication factor `R` should be configurable.
*   Implement a basic heartbeat mechanism for each node to detect node failures. If a node detects that another node has failed, it should update its routing table and adjust its replica assignments accordingly.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   `N` can be a large number (e.g., 100, 1000).
*   The key and value sizes can be large (e.g., up to 1MB).
*   The system should be designed to handle a high volume of read and write requests.
*   Assume that node failures are relatively infrequent but can occur at any time.
*   Consider potential race conditions and ensure thread safety in your implementation.
*   Your solution should be scalable and maintainable.  Think about how you would add new features or improve performance in the future.

**Bonus Points:**

*   Implement a mechanism for handling hinted handoff when a node is temporarily unavailable.
*   Implement a mechanism for resolving conflicts when multiple nodes have different versions of the same value.
*   Add a simple monitoring system to track the health and performance of the cluster.
*   Implement a command-line interface for interacting with the key-value store.

This is a complex problem that requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and data structures.  Your solution will be evaluated based on its correctness, efficiency, fault tolerance, and scalability. Good luck!

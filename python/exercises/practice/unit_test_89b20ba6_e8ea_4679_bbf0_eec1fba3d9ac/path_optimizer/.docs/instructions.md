Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging, requiring a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and optimization:

## Project Name

`AutonomousVehiclePathPlanning`

## Question Description

Imagine you are tasked with designing the path planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle navigating a complex urban environment. The environment is represented as a directed graph.

*   **Nodes:** Represent intersections or key locations. Each node has a unique ID, GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude), and a traffic density score (a float between 0 and 1, representing the level of congestion, with 0 being free-flowing and 1 being completely blocked).

*   **Edges:** Represent road segments connecting nodes. Each edge has a length (in meters), a speed limit (km/h), a toll cost (a non-negative integer), and a set of time-dependent congestion factors. These congestion factors are a list of 24 floats (one for each hour of the day), which multiply the travel time of the edge for that specific hour.  For example, a congestion factor of 2.0 at 8:00 AM would double the travel time of that edge if traversed at that time.

Given a starting node, a destination node, a departure time (hour of the day, 0-23), a maximum budget (in toll cost units), and a range of acceptable arrival times (earliest and latest arrival time measured in hours from departure time, i.e., if the departure time is 8:00 AM and the arrival window is 1 hour to 2 hours, the acceptable arrival is between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM), find the *optimal* path for the autonomous vehicle.

"Optimal" is defined as minimizing a weighted combination of travel time and risk.

*   **Travel Time:**  Total time spent traversing the path (accounting for edge lengths, speed limits, and time-dependent congestion).

*   **Risk:**  Sum of the traffic density scores of all nodes in the path.

The weighting between travel time and risk is controlled by a "risk aversion factor," `alpha` (a float between 0 and 1).  A value of `alpha` close to 0 indicates a strong preference for minimizing travel time, while a value close to 1 indicates a strong preference for minimizing risk (even at the expense of longer travel times).  The objective function to minimize is:

`Cost = alpha * TotalRisk + (1 - alpha) * TotalTravelTime`

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Time-Dependent Travel Time:**  You *must* account for the time-dependent congestion factors on each edge.  The travel time on an edge depends on the *hour of day* when the vehicle *enters* that edge.

2.  **Budget Constraint:** The total toll cost of the selected path *must not exceed* the given maximum budget.

3.  **Arrival Time Window:**  The arrival time at the destination node *must fall within* the specified earliest and latest arrival time window, relative to the departure time.

4.  **Efficiency:** The graph can be large (thousands of nodes and edges). Your solution *must* be efficient enough to find a near-optimal path within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds for a graph of moderate size). Consider the potential for A\* search with a suitable heuristic.

5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no path exists within the given constraints (return an appropriate indicator - for example, an empty path or a specific error code). Handle cases where the start and destination nodes are the same.

6.  **GPS Coordinates:** The GPS coordinates are only used for computing an admissible heuristic.

7.  **Heuristic Function:** You must implement and use an admissible heuristic to improve the performance of your pathfinding algorithm. A good heuristic could be based on the Euclidean distance between nodes, ignoring congestion and toll costs.
8.  **Multi-Modal Path:** Consider that the vehicle might need to switch between different road types represented by different speed limits.

**Input:**

*   A directed graph represented as a dictionary/adjacency list.  Keys are node IDs, and values are dictionaries containing:
    *   `coordinates`: A tuple (latitude, longitude).
    *   `traffic_density`: A float (0 to 1).
    *   `edges`: A dictionary where keys are destination node IDs, and values are dictionaries containing:
        *   `length`: A float (meters).
        *   `speed_limit`: An integer (km/h).
        *   `toll_cost`: An integer.
        *   `congestion_factors`: A list of 24 floats.
*   `start_node`: The ID of the starting node.
*   `destination_node`: The ID of the destination node.
*   `departure_time`: An integer representing the departure hour (0-23).
*   `max_budget`: An integer representing the maximum toll cost.
*   `earliest_arrival`: A float representing the earliest acceptable arrival time (hours from departure).
*   `latest_arrival`: A float representing the latest acceptable arrival time (hours from departure).
*   `alpha`: A float (0 to 1) representing the risk aversion factor.

**Output:**

*   A list of node IDs representing the optimal path from the start node to the destination node, or an empty list if no path is found within the constraints. If a path is found, also return the total travel time, total risk, and total toll cost of the path as a tuple.

**Example:**

```python
graph = {
    'A': {'coordinates': (37.7749, -122.4194), 'traffic_density': 0.2, 'edges': {'B': {'length': 5000, 'speed_limit': 50, 'toll_cost': 2, 'congestion_factors': [1.0] * 24}, 'C': {'length': 3000, 'speed_limit': 30, 'toll_cost': 1, 'congestion_factors': [1.0] * 24}}},
    'B': {'coordinates': (37.7833, -122.4167), 'traffic_density': 0.5, 'edges': {'D': {'length': 4000, 'speed_limit': 40, 'toll_cost': 3, 'congestion_factors': [1.0] * 24}}},
    'C': {'coordinates': (37.7900, -122.4000), 'traffic_density': 0.8, 'edges': {'D': {'length': 2000, 'speed_limit': 60, 'toll_cost': 0, 'congestion_factors': [1.0] * 24}}},
    'D': {'coordinates': (37.7967, -122.3933), 'traffic_density': 0.1, 'edges': {}}
}

start_node = 'A'
destination_node = 'D'
departure_time = 8
max_budget = 5
earliest_arrival = 0.1
latest_arrival = 0.5
alpha = 0.5

path, total_travel_time, total_risk, total_toll_cost = find_optimal_path(graph, start_node, destination_node, departure_time, max_budget, earliest_arrival, latest_arrival, alpha)

# Expected output (values may vary slightly based on implementation details):
# path = ['A', 'C', 'D']
# total_travel_time = 0.11666666666666667 (hours)
# total_risk = 0.9
# total_toll_cost = 1
```

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithmic choices (e.g., A\* search, Dijkstra's algorithm), and optimization techniques. Good luck!

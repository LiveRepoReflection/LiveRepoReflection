Okay, here's a challenging problem designed with the specifications you provided.

**Project Name:** `NetworkOptimization`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the data flow within a complex communication network represented as a directed graph. The network consists of `N` nodes (numbered from 0 to N-1) and `M` directed edges. Each edge `(u, v)` has a capacity `c`, representing the maximum amount of data that can flow from node `u` to node `v`.

Additionally, each node `i` has a processing capacity `p_i`, representing the maximum amount of data that can be processed at that node. Data entering a node must be processed before it can be forwarded along outgoing edges.

You are given a set of `K` data streams. Each stream `k` originates at a source node `s_k` and terminates at a destination node `t_k`. Each stream has a demand `d_k`, representing the amount of data that must be delivered from `s_k` to `t_k`.

Your goal is to determine the maximum percentage of all data streams that can be simultaneously satisfied, while respecting the edge capacities and node processing capacities. The percentage should be calculated as: (total_satisfied_demand / total_initial_demand) * 100.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The network is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple `(u, v, c)`. The nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.
2.  **Node Processing Capacity:** The node processing capacities are given as a list `p` of length `N`, where `p[i]` is the processing capacity of node `i`.
3.  **Data Streams:** The data streams are represented as a list of streams, where each stream is a tuple `(s_k, t_k, d_k)`.
4.  **Optimization Goal:** Maximize the percentage of satisfied data streams. You *do not* need to satisfy each stream entirely. Streams can be partially satisfied.
5.  **Capacity Constraints:** The flow along each edge `(u, v)` must not exceed the edge capacity `c`. The total flow through each node `i` (sum of incoming flows) must not exceed the node's processing capacity `p_i`.
6.  **Computational Complexity:** The solution must be efficient. A naive approach will likely time out for larger networks. Consider using network flow algorithms (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic's algorithm) or linear programming techniques.
7.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   The graph may not be connected.
    *   There may be multiple streams with the same source and destination.
    *   Some streams may be impossible to satisfy due to capacity constraints.
    *   The input data can be large (up to 1000 nodes, 5000 edges, 1000 streams).
8. **Numerical Precision:** The output percentage needs to be correct to two decimal places.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (integer).
*   `M`: The number of edges in the network (integer).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, c)` representing the edges, where `u` is the source node, `v` is the destination node, and `c` is the capacity (list of tuples).
*   `p`: A list of integers representing the processing capacity of each node (list of integers).
*   `K`: The number of data streams (integer).
*   `streams`: A list of tuples `(s_k, t_k, d_k)` representing the data streams, where `s_k` is the source node, `t_k` is the destination node, and `d_k` is the demand (list of tuples).

**Output:**

*   A float representing the maximum percentage of data streams that can be simultaneously satisfied, rounded to two decimal places.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and the ability to handle complex constraints. It encourages the use of efficient algorithms to achieve the desired performance. Good luck!

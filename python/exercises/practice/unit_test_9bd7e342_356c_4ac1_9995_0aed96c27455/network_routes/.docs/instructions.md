Okay, here's a challenging and sophisticated coding problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating various complex elements.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are given a network represented by a set of nodes and a set of edges. Each node represents a server, and each edge represents a communication link between two servers. The network is described as follows:

*   `n`: The number of servers (nodes) in the network, numbered from 0 to n-1.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w, c)` represents a bidirectional communication link between server `u` and server `v` with `w` representing bandwidth and `c` representing cost.
*   `start`: The starting server node.
*   `end`: The destination server node.

Your task is to design an algorithm that finds the **k** best routes (paths) from the `start` server to the `end` server, considering both bandwidth and cost. A route's bandwidth is the *minimum* bandwidth of all edges along the path. A route's cost is the *sum* of the costs of all edges along the path.

Routes should be sorted in descending order of their *utility*. Utility is defined as the ratio of bandwidth to cost (bandwidth / cost).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Large Network:** The network can be large (up to 1000 servers and 10000 edges).  Aim for an efficient algorithmic approach.
2.  **Multiple Paths:** There might be multiple paths between the start and end servers.
3.  **Disconnected Graph:** The graph might not be fully connected. If `end` is unreachable from `start`, return an empty list.
4.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle cases where bandwidth or cost of an edge is zero appropriately. A zero cost should be treated as invalid (avoiding division by zero). Exclude paths that contain edges with zero bandwidth or zero cost.
    *   Handle cases where the start and end nodes are the same. In this case, the only possible route is one with no edges (cost 0, infinite bandwidth/cost ratio, which should be considered as very high utility).
    *   Handle cases where k is larger than the total number of possible paths.
5.  **Optimization:** Focus on optimizing the algorithm's time complexity. Naive brute-force solutions will likely time out for larger test cases. Consider using appropriate data structures to efficiently explore the graph.
6.  **K-Best Paths:** You need to find the *k* best paths. If there are fewer than *k* paths, return all possible paths. If there are multiple paths with same utility, return all of them.
7.  **Path Representation:** Each route (path) should be returned as a list of server node IDs in the order they are visited, starting with `start` and ending with `end`.
8.  **Tie Breaking:** If multiple paths have the same utility, they should be returned in any order.
9.  **No Cycles:** Routes should ideally not contain cycles. If a cycle is unavoidable and leads to a better utility, it can be considered, but prioritize cycle-free paths where possible.

**Input:**

*   `n` (integer): The number of servers.
*   `edges` (list of tuples): The list of edges, where each tuple is `(u, v, w, c)`.
*   `start` (integer): The starting server.
*   `end` (integer): The destination server.
*   `k` (integer): The number of best paths to find.

**Output:**

A list of lists, where each inner list represents a route (path) from `start` to `end`, sorted in descending order of utility (bandwidth / cost).  Each route is a list of node IDs.

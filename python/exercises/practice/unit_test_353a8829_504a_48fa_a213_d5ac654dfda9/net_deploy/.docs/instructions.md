`OptimalNetworkDeployment`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient network deployment strategy for a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each with varying computational resources and data storage capabilities. These nodes are geographically dispersed and interconnected through a network.

Your goal is to determine the optimal placement of `K` critical services across these `N` nodes to minimize the overall network latency and resource consumption while ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The network is represented as a weighted undirected graph. Each node in the graph corresponds to a node in the distributed system. Edges represent network connections, and edge weights represent the latency between connected nodes. You will be given an adjacency matrix representing this graph.

2.  **Service Dependencies:** Each of the `K` services has dependencies on other services.  A service `A` may require service `B` to be running on the same node or a nearby node. These dependencies are represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  If service `A` depends on service `B`, `A` must be deployed such that its average network latency to all instances of `B` is below a specified threshold, `dependency_latency_threshold`.  If service `B` is deployed on the same node as service `A`, the latency is considered 0.

3.  **Resource Constraints:** Each node has a limited amount of resources (CPU, memory, storage). Each service requires a specific amount of these resources. The sum of the resource requirements of all services deployed on a node cannot exceed the node's resource capacity. Node resources are represented as a tuple `(cpu, memory, storage)` and service requirements as `(cpu_req, memory_req, storage_req)`.  All resources are integers.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:**  Each service must be deployed with a minimum replication factor `R`. This means that at least `R` instances of each service must be running in the network.

5.  **Optimization Objective:**  Minimize the total weighted latency.  The weighted latency is calculated as the sum, across all services, of the product of the latency between each pair of communicating services multiplied by the amount of communication between them. Communication amounts are provided for each service pair. For a single service, the latency to itself is 0.

6.  **Handling Failures:** The system must be able to tolerate up to `F` node failures. After removing F failed nodes, the minimum replication factor `R` for each service must still be satisfied.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the distributed system.
*   `K`: The number of critical services to deploy.
*   `adjacency_matrix`: A `N x N` 2D list of integers representing the weighted adjacency matrix of the network graph. `adjacency_matrix[i][j]` represents the latency between node `i` and node `j`. A value of `-1` indicates no direct connection. Assume the matrix is symmetric and `adjacency_matrix[i][i] = 0`.
*   `service_dependencies`: A dictionary where keys are service IDs (0 to K-1) and values are lists of service IDs that the key service depends on. Represents a DAG.
*   `dependency_latency_threshold`: An integer representing the maximum acceptable latency between dependent services.
*   `node_resources`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the `(cpu, memory, storage)` capacity of a node. `node_resources[i]` represents the resources of node `i`.
*   `service_requirements`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the `(cpu_req, memory_req, storage_req)` requirements of a service. `service_requirements[i]` represents the resource requirements of service `i`.
*   `replication_factor`: An integer representing the minimum replication factor `R` for each service.
*   `node_failures_tolerated`: An integer representing the maximum number of node failures `F` the system must tolerate.
*   `service_communication`: A `K x K` 2D list of integers representing communication volume between services. `service_communication[i][j]` represents the amount of communication from service `i` to service `j`.

**Output:**

*   A dictionary representing the optimal deployment plan. The keys are service IDs (0 to K-1), and the values are lists of node IDs where that service should be deployed.  If no solution is possible, return an empty dictionary.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `1 <= K <= 10`
*   `1 <= R <= 5`
*   `0 <= F < N`
*   All latency values in `adjacency_matrix` are non-negative integers.
*   All resource values are non-negative integers.
*   Assume a path always exists between any two nodes.
*   Assume the dependency graph is a DAG.
*   Minimize the total weighted latency, subject to all constraints.  If multiple deployments have the same minimal weighted latency, any of these deployments are acceptable.

**Scoring:**

The solution will be judged based on its correctness (satisfying all constraints) and its effectiveness in minimizing the total weighted latency. Solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints will receive a score of 0. Solutions that satisfy the constraints will be ranked based on their total weighted latency, with lower latency receiving a higher score.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path), resource allocation strategies, constraint satisfaction techniques, and optimization algorithms.  Efficiently exploring the solution space is crucial for achieving a good score.

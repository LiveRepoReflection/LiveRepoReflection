## Question Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator. This coordinator will manage transactions across multiple independent service instances (simulated as Python classes), ensuring atomicity (all or nothing) and consistency (data integrity) using a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

Each service instance has a local state (represented as a dictionary) and can perform operations that modify this state. A transaction involves operations on potentially multiple service instances. The transaction coordinator must orchestrate these operations and guarantee that either all operations succeed (the transaction is committed) or none of them succeed (the transaction is rolled back), even in the face of potential service failures (simulated by exceptions).

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Service Instances:** Represented by classes with the following interface:
    *   `__init__(self, service_id: str)`: Initializes the service with a unique `service_id` and an empty initial state (a dictionary).
    *   `prepare(self, transaction_id: str, operations: List[Tuple[str, Any]]) -> bool`: Receives a transaction ID and a list of operations. Each operation is a tuple of `(key, value)`.  This method *tentatively* applies the operations to the service's local state, but does *not* commit them permanently. It returns `True` if the service is able to prepare the transaction and `False` otherwise (e.g., due to insufficient resources, validation errors, or conflicting operations). The service must record the *tentative* changes in a local transaction log.
    *   `commit(self, transaction_id: str)`:  *Permanently* applies the prepared changes associated with the given transaction ID to the service's local state. Clears the corresponding entry from the transaction log.
    *   `rollback(self, transaction_id: str)`: Discards the prepared changes associated with the given transaction ID, restoring the service's local state to its original state before the `prepare` call. Clears the corresponding entry from the transaction log.
    *   `get_state(self) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Returns a copy of the service's current state.

2.  **Transaction Coordinator:** Implement a class with the following interface:
    *   `__init__(self)`: Initializes the coordinator.
    *   `register_service(self, service: Any)`: Registers a service instance with the coordinator.
    *   `begin_transaction(self) -> str`: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique transaction ID (a UUID string).
    *   `execute_transaction(self, transaction_id: str, operations: Dict[str, List[Tuple[str, Any]]]) -> bool`: Executes a transaction with the given ID. The `operations` argument is a dictionary where the keys are `service_id`s and the values are lists of operations (as described above) to be performed on that service. This method should orchestrate the 2PC protocol. It returns `True` if the transaction is successfully committed and `False` if it is rolled back.
    *   `get_service_state(self, service_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`:  Returns a copy of the state of the given service.

3.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:**  The `execute_transaction` method must implement the following 2PC protocol:
    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):**
        *   The coordinator sends a `prepare` message to all participating services, including the transaction ID and the list of operations for that service.
        *   The coordinator waits for responses from all services.
        *   If *any* service returns `False` (indicating it cannot prepare the transaction), the coordinator proceeds to the rollback phase.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit or Rollback Phase):**
        *   If all services successfully prepared the transaction (all returned `True`), the coordinator sends a `commit` message to all participating services.
        *   If any service failed to prepare, the coordinator sends a `rollback` message to all participating services.
        *   The coordinator waits for all services to complete the commit or rollback operation.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Services may raise exceptions during the `prepare`, `commit`, or `rollback` phases to simulate failures. The coordinator must catch these exceptions and handle them appropriately.  If a service fails during the prepare phase, the coordinator should rollback all other services.  If a service fails during the commit or rollback phase, the coordinator should retry the operation a reasonable number of times (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff) before giving up and logging an error. The transaction should still return `False` in cases of failure during commit/rollback.
    *   The coordinator must handle cases where a service becomes unavailable during the transaction.

5.  **Concurrency:** The solution must be thread-safe. Multiple transactions can be executed concurrently.

6.  **Optimization:** Minimize the impact on service performance.  Avoid unnecessary locking or synchronization that could lead to bottlenecks.

**Constraints:**

*   You must use Python 3.x.
*   The solution must be efficient and scalable.
*   The code must be well-structured and easy to understand.
*   You can use standard Python libraries (e.g., `threading`, `uuid`, `time`).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example code (not part of the solution, just for illustration)
service1 = Service("service1")
service2 = Service("service2")

coordinator = TransactionCoordinator()
coordinator.register_service(service1)
coordinator.register_service(service2)

transaction_id = coordinator.begin_transaction()

operations = {
    "service1": [("key1", "value1"), ("key2", "value2")],
    "service2": [("key3", "value3"), ("key4", "value4")],
}

success = coordinator.execute_transaction(transaction_id, operations)

if success:
    print("Transaction committed successfully.")
else:
    print("Transaction rolled back.")

print(f"Service 1 state: {coordinator.get_service_state('service1')}")
print(f"Service 2 state: {coordinator.get_service_state('service2')}")
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the 2PC implementation.
*   Handling of service failures and exceptions.
*   Thread safety and concurrency.
*   Code quality, readability, and maintainability.
*   Efficiency and scalability.
*   Adherence to the specified interface and constraints.

## Question: Decentralized Collaborative Filtering

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a decentralized collaborative filtering system for a massive online platform with millions of users and items. Due to privacy concerns and legal regulations, centralizing user data is not an option. Instead, you must design a system where recommendations are generated using only locally available user data and publicly shared (but anonymized) information.

**Scenario:**

Imagine an online platform where users rate items (e.g., movies, books, products) on a scale of 1 to 5. Your goal is to predict the rating a user would give to an item they haven't yet rated, based on the ratings of other similar users. However, you can't directly access individual user ratings from a central database.

**Problem:**

Design and implement a system that allows each user to generate personalized recommendations using the following constraints:

1.  **Decentralization:** User rating data is stored locally on each user's device or in a private data store. No central server has access to individual user ratings.

2.  **Privacy:** The system must minimize the risk of revealing individual user preferences to other users or external entities.

3.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a massive number of users and items.

4.  **Efficiency:** Recommendation generation should be reasonably fast, even with a large user base.

5.  **Cold Start:** Address the challenge of providing recommendations for new users or items with very few ratings.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **Data Representation:** You can assume each user has a list of (item\_id, rating) pairs stored locally.

*   **Global Information:** The system can utilize a globally accessible, but anonymized, data structure. This could include things like:

    *   A mapping of item\_id to item category.
    *   Aggregate statistics about item ratings (e.g., average rating, rating variance).
    *   Pre-computed similarity measures between item categories.
    *   The count of items rated by each user.

*   **User-Specific Calculations:** Each user must perform calculations locally to generate recommendations. These calculations can utilize the global information and their own local ratings data.

*   **Similarity Metric:** Implement a custom similarity metric that considers both item categories and rating values.  The similarity metric should be robust to sparse data (i.e., handle users with only a few ratings).  Consider using techniques like shrinkage or regularization to improve the stability of the similarity metric.

*   **Recommendation Algorithm:** Implement a recommendation algorithm that predicts a user's rating for an item based on the ratings of similar users. You can use a weighted average of ratings, a k-nearest neighbors approach, or other suitable methods.

*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Implement a mechanism to protect user privacy.  This could involve techniques like:

    *   Differential Privacy (adding noise to the global information).
    *   Federated Learning (training a model collaboratively without sharing raw data).
    *   Homomorphic Encryption (performing computations on encrypted data).
    *   K-Anonymity (ensuring that no user's data can be uniquely identified within the global data).

*   **Optimization:** Your solution will be evaluated on the efficiency of the recommendation generation process, especially with an increasing number of users. Consider using efficient data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Accuracy:** How accurately does the system predict user ratings?
*   **Privacy:** How well does the system protect user privacy?
*   **Scalability:** How well does the system scale to a large number of users and items?
*   **Efficiency:** How quickly can recommendations be generated?
*   **Cold Start Handling:** How effectively does the system provide recommendations for new users and items?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?

**Constraints:**

*   You are **not** allowed to directly access individual user ratings from a central database.
*   All user-specific calculations must be performed locally.
*   The globally accessible data structure must be anonymized to protect user privacy.
*   The solution must be implementable within a reasonable time frame.
*   You are allowed to use standard Python libraries and data structures.
*   You must clearly document your design choices and the rationale behind them.  Explain the trade-offs you are making between accuracy, privacy, scalability, and efficiency.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the recommendations they receive, and use this feedback to improve the accuracy of the system.
*   Explore different privacy-preserving techniques and compare their performance and privacy guarantees.
*   Design a system that can adapt to changes in user preferences over time.
*   Implement a distributed computing framework to parallelize the recommendation generation process across multiple machines.

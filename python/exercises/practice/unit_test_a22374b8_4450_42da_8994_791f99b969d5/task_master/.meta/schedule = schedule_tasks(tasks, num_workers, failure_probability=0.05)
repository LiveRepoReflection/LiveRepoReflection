## Visualization

The visualization module provides two types of visualizations:

1. **Task Schedule**: A Gantt chart showing the execution of tasks on each worker over time
2. **Dependency Graph**: A directed graph showing the dependencies between tasks

## Implementation Details

The scheduler uses a priority-based algorithm that:

1. Keeps track of ready tasks in a priority queue
2. Assigns tasks to available workers based on their priorities
3. Updates task dependencies when tasks complete
4. Reschedules tasks when workers fail
5. Advances time efficiently to minimize makespan

The visualization uses Matplotlib for rendering charts and NetworkX for graph visualization.

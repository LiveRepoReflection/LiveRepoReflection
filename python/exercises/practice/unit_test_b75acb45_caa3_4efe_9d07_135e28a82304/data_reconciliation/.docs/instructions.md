## Question: Network Partitioning for Data Synchronization

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a distributed database system that replicates data across multiple nodes. Due to network instability, nodes can become temporarily disconnected, forming isolated partitions. When the network recovers and partitions merge, data conflicts can arise.

Your task is to implement a system that efficiently reconciles these conflicts after a network partition.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Data Model:** The database stores key-value pairs. Keys are strings, and values are integers. Each node initially holds a complete copy of the database.

2.  **Partitioning:** The network can partition into multiple isolated groups of nodes. Within each partition, nodes can freely update the key-value store. Updates within a partition are guaranteed to be consistent.

3.  **Conflict Resolution:** When partitions merge, the system must resolve conflicting updates for the same key. You are provided with the state of the database on each node after the partition. For each key, you need to determine the final, reconciled value.

4.  **Conflict Resolution Strategy:** Implement the "Last Write Wins" (LWW) strategy. Each key-value pair is associated with a timestamp indicating when it was last updated. When conflicts arise, the key-value pair with the latest timestamp wins. If multiple nodes have the same timestamp for the same key, pick the lowest value to resolve.

5.  **Input:** The input is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the state of a single node in the system after the partition. Each dictionary contains key-value pairs and their associated timestamps.

    ```python
    [
      {
        "key1": {"value": 10, "timestamp": 1678886400},
        "key2": {"value": 20, "timestamp": 1678886405},
        ...
      },
      {
        "key1": {"value": 15, "timestamp": 1678886402},
        "key3": {"value": 30, "timestamp": 1678886410},
        ...
      },
      ...
    ]
    ```

6.  **Output:**  A single dictionary representing the final, reconciled state of the database. It should contain the keys and their final values after conflict resolution.

    ```python
    {
      "key1": 15,
      "key2": 20,
      "key3": 30,
      ...
    }
    ```

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, especially when dealing with a large number of nodes and key-value pairs. Aim for a solution that scales well.
*   **Correctness:** The solution must correctly implement the LWW conflict resolution strategy.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Empty input (no nodes).
    *   Nodes with no data.
    *   Keys present in only some nodes.
    *   Identical timestamps for conflicting keys across multiple nodes. Ensure that the lowest value is chosen in this case.
*   **Data Structures:** Consider using appropriate data structures to optimize the conflict resolution process.
*   **Scalability:**  The solution should be designed with scalability in mind. How would you handle a very large number of nodes (e.g., thousands) and a huge dataset?  (You don't need to implement a fully distributed solution, but your code should be structured in a way that could be extended to a distributed environment.)
*   **Immutability:** The input databases should not be modified in place. Ensure that you create a copy of the data if you need to manipulate it.
*   **Error Handling:** While not explicitly required to raise exceptions, the code should handle unexpected data gracefully (e.g., non-integer values, missing timestamps). Log a warning in such cases and proceed with the rest of the data.

This problem tests your understanding of data structures, algorithms, conflict resolution strategies, and system design principles. It requires you to write efficient and robust code that can handle various edge cases. Good luck!

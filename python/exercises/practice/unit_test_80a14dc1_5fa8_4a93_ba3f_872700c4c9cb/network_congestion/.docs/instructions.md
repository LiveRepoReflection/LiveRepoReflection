## Question: Network Congestion Game

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a load balancing strategy for a network of servers. The network consists of `N` servers and `M` users. Each user needs to send a fixed amount of data to one of the servers. Your goal is to minimize the *maximum congestion* on any server.

Each server `i` has a processing capacity `C_i`. Each user `j` has a data volume `D_j` that needs to be processed. You need to assign each user to a server such that the total data volume assigned to each server does not exceed its capacity.

However, the network has a unique characteristic: *congestion-dependent latency*. The latency on a server `i` is a function of the total data volume assigned to it. Specifically, the latency `L_i` for server `i` is defined as:

```
L_i = (V_i / C_i)^K
```

where:

*   `V_i` is the total data volume assigned to server `i`.
*   `C_i` is the capacity of server `i`.
*   `K` is a congestion exponent (a fixed constant for the entire network).

The *network congestion* is defined as the *maximum latency* among all servers. Your task is to find an assignment of users to servers that *minimizes* the network congestion.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of servers (1 <= N <= 20).
*   `M`: The number of users (1 <= M <= 200).
*   `C`: A list of server capacities `C_i` (1 <= C_i <= 1000) for each server `i` from 0 to N-1.
*   `D`: A list of data volumes `D_j` (1 <= D_j <= 100) for each user `j` from 0 to M-1.
*   `K`: The congestion exponent (1 <= K <= 3).

**Output:**

A list of `M` integers, where the `i`-th integer represents the server assigned to user `i`. Server indices are 0-based. If no assignment is possible such that the capacity constraint is satisfied, return `None`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Capacity Constraint:** The total data volume assigned to a server cannot exceed its capacity.  This constraint MUST be satisfied.
*   **Optimization:** You need to *minimize* the network congestion (maximum latency among all servers). Finding the *absolute* optimal solution might be computationally expensive, especially with larger inputs. Aim for a *good*, not necessarily perfect, solution within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).
*   **Multiple Valid Solutions:** If multiple assignments result in the same minimal network congestion, any of them is considered a valid solution.
*   **Complexity:** The brute-force approach of trying all possible assignments will likely be too slow.  Consider more intelligent search strategies or approximation algorithms.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle the case where no valid assignment is possible.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must be reasonably efficient, especially for larger values of `M` and `N`. Avoid unnecessary computations or data structure operations.
*   **Tie-breaking:** When multiple servers result in same latency, you can break ties using any deterministic approach. (e.g. the server with the smallest index)
*   **K Value:** K can be a non-integer value.

This problem requires a combination of algorithm design, data structure selection, and optimization techniques to find a solution that minimizes network congestion while respecting the capacity constraints. Good luck!

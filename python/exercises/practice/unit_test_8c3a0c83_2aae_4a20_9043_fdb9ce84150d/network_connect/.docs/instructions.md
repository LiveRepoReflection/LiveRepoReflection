Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging programming competition problem. Here it is:

Network Connectivity Analysis

### Question Description

You are given a representation of a complex communication network. The network consists of nodes and directional connections between nodes. Each node represents a server, and each connection represents the ability for one server to directly transmit data to another. The network is represented as a list of servers (`servers`), and a list of connections (`connections`).

Your task is to design and implement a function that can efficiently determine the **minimum number of additional connections** needed to ensure that any server in the network can communicate with any other server, either directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediate servers.

**Input:**

*   `servers`: A list of strings, where each string represents the unique identifier of a server in the network (e.g., `["A", "B", "C", "D"]`).
*   `connections`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a directional connection between two servers. The first element of the tuple is the source server, and the second element is the destination server (e.g., `[("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("C", "A")]`). Note that the connection `("A", "B")` only allows `A` to send data to `B`, not the other way around.

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the minimum number of additional directional connections needed to make the network strongly connected. A strongly connected network is one where every server can reach every other server.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

1.  **Network Size:** The number of servers can be large (up to 10^5). The number of connections can also be large (up to 10^6). Therefore, algorithmic efficiency is crucial.
2.  **Disconnected Components:** The network may consist of multiple disconnected components. You must identify these components and determine how to connect them.
3.  **Cycles:** The network may contain cycles. Your solution should handle cycles correctly.
4.  **Self-Loops:** The network can contain self-loops (e.g., `("A", "A")`). Self-loops do not contribute to connectivity between different servers. Ignore self-loops.
5.  **Duplicate Connections:** The input may contain duplicate connections. Treat each unique connection only once.
6.  **Empty Network:** If the input `servers` list is empty, the network is considered strongly connected, and the function should return 0. If the `servers` list is not empty but there are no connections, then you will need to add `n` connections where `n` is the number of servers if `n>1`, and return 0 if `n<=1`.
7.  **Server Existence:** All servers mentioned in the `connections` list must exist in the `servers` list. If a connection refers to a server not in the `servers` list, raise a ValueError with a message describing the invalid server.
8.  **Optimized Solution:**  A naive solution with O(n^2) complexity may not pass all test cases. Aim for a solution with better time complexity such as O(V+E) using graph traversal algorithms.
9.  **Ordering:** the connections added can be in any order, as long as it is the minimum number of connections to connect the graph.

**Example:**

```python
servers = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
connections = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C")]
# Expected Output: 2  (Connect C->D and D->A or C->A and D->A)

servers = ["A", "B", "C"]
connections = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("C", "A")]
# Expected Output: 0 (Already strongly connected)

servers = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
connections = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("D", "E")]
# Expected Output: 2 (Connect C->D and E->A)

servers = ["A", "B", "C"]
connections = []
# Expected Output: 2 (Need to connect all 3)

servers = ["A"]
connections = []
# Expected Output: 0 (Already connected since only one node)

servers = []
connections = []
# Expected Output: 0 (Empty case)
```

This problem requires a good understanding of graph theory concepts, efficient algorithms for graph traversal, and careful handling of edge cases to achieve an optimized solution. Good luck!

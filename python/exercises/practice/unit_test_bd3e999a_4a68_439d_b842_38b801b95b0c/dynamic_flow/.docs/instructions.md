## Question Title:

### Multi-Commodity Flow Optimization on a Dynamic Network

## Question Description:

You are tasked with optimizing the flow of multiple commodities through a dynamic network. The network represents a transportation system, and each commodity represents a different type of goods that needs to be transported from its source to its destination. The network is dynamic because the capacity of the edges (roads, pipelines, etc.) changes over time due to planned maintenance, unexpected events (accidents, weather), or other external factors.

**Network Description:**

The network is represented as a directed graph `G = (V, E)`, where `V` is the set of vertices (locations) and `E` is the set of edges (transportation links).

*   Each edge `e ∈ E` has a time-dependent capacity `c(e, t)`, representing the maximum amount of flow that can pass through the edge at time `t`. The capacity is given as a discrete function, where `t` is an integer representing a time unit.
*   Each commodity `k` has a source vertex `s_k`, a destination vertex `t_k`, and a demand `d_k`, representing the amount of flow of commodity `k` that needs to be transported from `s_k` to `t_k`.

**Dynamic Capacity Changes:**

You are given a list of capacity change events. Each event specifies an edge `e`, a time `t`, and a new capacity `c'`. This means that the capacity of edge `e` changes to `c'` at time `t`. The capacity remains `c'` until the next capacity change event for that edge, or the end of the simulation time.

**Objective:**

Your objective is to find a feasible multi-commodity flow that satisfies the demands of all commodities while respecting the capacity constraints of the edges at each time step. Specifically, you need to determine the flow `f_k(e, t)` for each commodity `k` on each edge `e` at each time `t`.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Capacity Constraints:** For each edge `e` and time `t`, the total flow through the edge cannot exceed its capacity:

    `∑_k f_k(e, t) <= c(e, t)`

2.  **Flow Conservation:** For each commodity `k` and vertex `v` (except the source and destination), the total flow entering the vertex must equal the total flow leaving the vertex:

    For all `v != s_k, t_k`:

    `∑_{u: (u, v) ∈ E} f_k((u, v), t) = ∑_{w: (v, w) ∈ E} f_k((v, w), t)`

3.  **Demand Satisfaction:** For each commodity `k`, the net flow leaving the source vertex must equal the demand `d_k`:

    `∑_{v: (s_k, v) ∈ E} f_k((s_k, v), t) - ∑_{u: (u, s_k) ∈ E} f_k((u, s_k), t) = d_k`

    Similarly, the net flow entering the destination vertex must equal the demand `d_k`:

    `∑_{u: (u, t_k) ∈ E} f_k((u, t_k), t) - ∑_{v: (t_k, v) ∈ E} f_k((t_k, v), t) = d_k`

4.  **Non-negativity:** The flow of each commodity on each edge at each time step must be non-negative:

    `f_k(e, t) >= 0`

**Input:**

*   `V`: A list of vertices, represented by integers.
*   `E`: A list of edges, represented by tuples `(u, v)`, where `u` and `v` are vertices.
*   `capacities`: A dictionary where keys are edges `(u, v)` and values are lists representing the capacity of the edge over time: `capacities[(u, v)] = [c_t1, c_t2, ..., c_tN]`. The index of the list represents the time step `t`.
*   `commodities`: A list of tuples `(s_k, t_k, d_k)`, where `s_k` is the source vertex, `t_k` is the destination vertex, and `d_k` is the demand for commodity `k`.
*   `events`: A list of tuples `(e, t, c')`, representing capacity change events, where `e` is the edge `(u, v)`, `t` is the time step, and `c'` is the new capacity.
*   `T`: The total number of time steps.

**Output:**

*   A dictionary representing the flow for each commodity on each edge at each time step: `flow[(k, e, t)] = f_k(e, t)`. Return an empty dictionary if no feasible flow can be found.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of vertices `|V|` is between 2 and 50.
*   The number of edges `|E|` is between `|V|-1` and 200.
*   The number of commodities is between 1 and 10.
*   The demand `d_k` for each commodity is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
*   The initial capacity `c(e, t)` of each edge is a positive integer between 1 and 200.
*   The number of capacity change events is between 0 and 500.
*   The time horizon `T` is between 1 and 100.
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   All vertices, edges, commodities, and events are valid.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The algorithm should be as efficient as possible. Aim for a solution that can handle the maximum input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).  Consider the time complexity of your solution.
*   Finding *any* feasible solution is sufficient; you do not need to find the *optimal* flow (e.g., minimizing cost).
*   Prioritize finding a solution over optimizing resource usage.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The network might be disconnected after some capacity changes, making it impossible to satisfy the demands of all commodities.
*   The demands of some commodities might be too high for the network to handle, even with the initial capacities.
*   Capacity changes might occur very frequently, requiring efficient handling of the dynamic network.
*   The graph may contain cycles.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, network flow, and dynamic programming techniques. Good luck!

## Question Description

You are tasked with efficiently coloring a massive, distributed graph using a variant of the greedy graph coloring algorithm. The graph is too large to fit in the memory of a single machine, so it's split across multiple worker nodes in a distributed system.

**Graph Representation:**

The graph is represented implicitly. You do not have access to the entire graph structure at once. Instead, you interact with the graph through a `GraphNode` object. Each `GraphNode` object represents a single node in the graph and provides the following methods:

*   `node_id()`: Returns a unique integer identifier for the node.
*   `get_neighbors()`: Returns a list of `node_id` of the node's neighbors.
*   `get_color()`: Returns the current color assigned to the node. If the node has not been colored yet, it returns `None`.
*   `set_color(color: int)`: Attempts to set the color of the node to the given `color`. Returns `True` if the color was successfully set (i.e., no conflict with neighbors), and `False` otherwise.

**Distributed Environment:**

You are provided with a `DistributedGraph` class, which handles the underlying distributed communication and node access. You interact with the `DistributedGraph` instance to access and manipulate `GraphNode` objects.

*   `get_node(node_id: int)`: Returns a `GraphNode` object corresponding to the given `node_id`. This method may involve network communication and should be used judiciously.
*   `all_node_ids()`: Returns a list of all `node_id`s in the graph.
*   `num_nodes()`: Returns the total number of nodes in the graph.

**Greedy Coloring Algorithm (Variant):**

Your goal is to implement a distributed variant of the greedy graph coloring algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1.  Iterate through the nodes in a specific order.
2.  For each node, find the smallest available color (positive integer) that is not used by any of its neighbors.
3.  Assign that color to the node. If the color cannot be assigned due to a conflict, skip the node and consider it later. You can only skip a node for a limited number of retries, and there is also a time constraint on the coloring process.

**Constraints:**

*   **Minimization of Network Communication:** Accessing `GraphNode` objects through `DistributedGraph.get_node()` is expensive due to network communication. Minimize the number of times you call this function.
*   **Distributed Coordination:** Nodes can be colored concurrently by different workers. You need to handle potential race conditions when assigning colors to neighboring nodes.
*   **Fairness:** All nodes should eventually be colored. Prevent starvation where some nodes are perpetually skipped.
*   **Optimality is not Required:** The goal is *not* to find the minimum number of colors required to color the graph (chromatic number). A valid coloring, even if it uses more colors than necessary, is acceptable.
*   **Time Limit:** The coloring process must complete within a reasonable time frame.
*   **Retry Limit:** Each node can only be retried a limited number of times if its color assignment fails due to a conflict.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Memory usage on each worker node is limited. Avoid loading the entire graph structure into memory.
*   **Graph Size:** The graph can be extremely large (millions or billions of nodes).
*   **Connectivity:** The graph may be sparse or dense.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `color_graph(graph: DistributedGraph, retry_limit: int, timeout: float)` that takes a `DistributedGraph` object, a `retry_limit`, and a `timeout` (in seconds) as input and attempts to color the graph using the distributed greedy coloring algorithm.

**Example:**

```python
class DistributedGraph:
    # ... (Implementation of DistributedGraph - provided to you)

    def get_node(self, node_id: int) -> GraphNode:
        # ... (Implementation - fetches node data from remote worker)
        pass

    def all_node_ids(self) -> List[int]:
        # ... (Implementation - returns all node IDs)
        pass

    def num_nodes(self) -> int:
        # ... (Implementation - returns the number of nodes in the graph)
        pass

class GraphNode:
    # ... (Implementation of GraphNode - provided to you)
    def node_id(self) -> int:
        # ... (Implementation - returns node ID)
        pass

    def get_neighbors(self) -> List[int]:
        # ... (Implementation - returns list of neighbor node IDs)
        pass

    def get_color(self) -> Optional[int]:
        # ... (Implementation - returns current color of the node or None if uncolored)
        pass

    def set_color(self, color: int) -> bool:
        # ... (Implementation - attempts to set the color of the node)
        pass

def color_graph(graph: DistributedGraph, retry_limit: int, timeout: float):
    """
    Colors the distributed graph using a distributed greedy algorithm.

    Args:
        graph: The DistributedGraph object representing the graph.
        retry_limit: The maximum number of times to retry coloring a node if it fails.
        timeout: The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for the coloring process.
    """
    # Your implementation here
    pass

```

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   Correctness: The resulting coloring must be valid (no two adjacent nodes have the same color).
*   Efficiency: The algorithm should minimize network communication and complete within the time limit.
*   Fairness: All nodes should be colored, and starvation should be avoided.
*   Scalability: The solution should be able to handle large graphs (millions or billions of nodes).
*   Robustness: The solution should handle potential race conditions and errors gracefully.
*   Code Clarity: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed algorithms, graph coloring techniques, and careful consideration of performance trade-offs. Good luck!

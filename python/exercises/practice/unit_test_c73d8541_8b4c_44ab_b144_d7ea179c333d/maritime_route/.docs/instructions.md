## Question: Efficient Maritime Route Planning with Dynamic Weather Constraints

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with developing an efficient route planning system for a cargo ship navigating a maritime environment. The environment is represented as a weighted graph, where nodes represent ports or significant waypoints, and edges represent navigable sea routes between them. Each edge has an associated distance representing the length of the route.

However, unlike a static graph problem, the weather conditions along each route can dynamically change, impacting the ship's speed and fuel consumption. These weather conditions are represented by a "hazard score" associated with each edge at a given time. The hazard score affects the cost of traversing an edge.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The maritime environment is represented as an undirected weighted graph. You are given:
    *   `N`: The number of nodes (ports/waypoints), numbered from 0 to N-1.
    *   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, distance)` represents an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with the given `distance`.

2.  **Dynamic Weather:** The weather conditions are dynamic and change over time. You are given a function `get_hazard_score(u, v, timestamp)` that returns the hazard score for the edge between nodes `u` and `v` at a given `timestamp`. The hazard score is a non-negative float.

3.  **Cost Calculation:** The cost of traversing an edge `(u, v)` at a given `timestamp` is calculated as:
    `cost = distance * (1 + hazard_score(u, v, timestamp))`

4.  **Departure Time Window:** The ship has a flexible departure time window. You are given:
    *   `start_node`: The starting node (port).
    *   `end_node`: The destination node (port).
    *   `earliest_departure_time`: The earliest time the ship can depart.
    *   `latest_departure_time`: The latest time the ship can depart.

5.  **Time Granularity:**  Time is discrete. You are given a `time_step` representing the smallest unit of time (e.g., 1 hour).  The ship can only depart and arrive at times that are multiples of `time_step`.

6.  **Traversal Time:** The time it takes to traverse an edge `(u, v)` is the `distance` divided by the ship's speed.  Assume the ship's speed is constant and is given as `ship_speed`.  The traversal time must be rounded *up* to the nearest multiple of `time_step`. For example, if the time to traverse is 2.3 hours, and `time_step` is 1, the traversal time is rounded up to 3.

7.  **Objective:** Find the minimum cost path from `start_node` to `end_node`, considering the dynamic weather conditions and the departure time window.

**Function Signature:**

```python
def find_min_cost_path(N, edges, start_node, end_node, earliest_departure_time, latest_departure_time, time_step, ship_speed, get_hazard_score):
    """
    Finds the minimum cost path between two nodes in a dynamic maritime environment.

    Args:
        N: The number of nodes.
        edges: A list of tuples (u, v, distance) representing edges.
        start_node: The starting node.
        end_node: The destination node.
        earliest_departure_time: The earliest departure time.
        latest_departure_time: The latest departure time.
        time_step: The time step.
        ship_speed: The ship's speed.
        get_hazard_score: A function that takes (u, v, timestamp) and returns the hazard score.

    Returns:
        The minimum cost of the path from start_node to end_node, or float('inf') if no path exists.
    """
    pass # Replace with your solution

```

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 100
*   1 <= len(edges) <= N * (N - 1) / 2
*   1 <= distance <= 1000 for each edge
*   0 <= earliest\_departure\_time <= latest\_departure\_time <= 1000
*   1 <= time\_step <= 10
*   1 <= ship\_speed <= 100
*   0 <= hazard\_score <= 10 for any edge and timestamp

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient, as the `get_hazard_score` function might be computationally expensive and called frequently. Consider caching or other optimization techniques.
*   The time complexity should be carefully considered due to the dynamic nature of the problem.

**Edge Cases:**

*   No path exists between the start and end nodes.
*   `start_node` and `end_node` are the same.
*   The graph is disconnected.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm to account for the time-varying edge costs.
*   Think about how to efficiently explore the possible departure times.
*   Dynamic Programming or caching strategies might improve performance.
*   Consider how to handle the discrete time steps and the rounding of traversal times.

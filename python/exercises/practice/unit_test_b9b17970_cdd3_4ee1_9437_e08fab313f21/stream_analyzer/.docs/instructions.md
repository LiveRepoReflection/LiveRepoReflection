Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question:

**Problem Title:** Concurrent Data Stream Analyzer

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a highly efficient and scalable system for analyzing a continuous stream of numerical data. This data stream arrives from multiple independent sources concurrently.  The system must maintain a set of real-time statistics across a sliding window of the most recent N data points observed *across all sources*.

Specifically, you need to implement a class, `ConcurrentStreamAnalyzer`, with the following methods:

*   `__init__(self, window_size: int, num_sources: int)`:
    *   Initializes the analyzer with a fixed window size *N* (`window_size`) and the number of concurrent data sources (`num_sources`). The window should initially be empty.
    *   `window_size` will be a positive integer.
    *   `num_sources` will be a positive integer.

*   `process_data(self, source_id: int, data_point: float)`:
    *   Ingests a single data point (`data_point`) from a specific source (`source_id`).
    *   `source_id` is an integer between 0 and `num_sources - 1` (inclusive). Invalid `source_id` should raise `ValueError`.
    *   `data_point` is a float.
    *   This method should be thread-safe, allowing multiple threads to call it concurrently from different sources.
    *   It must maintain the sliding window of the `window_size` most recent data points. Oldest data points should be evicted to make room for new ones. The window contains data across all `num_sources`.

*   `get_statistics(self) -> dict`:
    *   Returns a dictionary containing the following statistics calculated over the current data in the sliding window:
        *   `"mean"`: The arithmetic mean of the data points in the window. Return `None` if the window is empty.
        *   `"median"`: The median of the data points in the window. Return `None` if the window is empty.  If the window contains an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
        *   `"std_dev"`: The standard deviation of the data points in the window. Return `None` if the window is empty. Use the sample standard deviation formula (Bessel's correction).
        *   `"min"`: The minimum value in the window. Return `None` if the window is empty.
        *   `"max"`: The maximum value in the window. Return `None` if the window is empty.
    *   This method should also be thread-safe and return consistent results, even when `process_data` is being called concurrently.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The `process_data` method *must* be thread-safe. The data stream can arrive concurrently from different sources (threads).
*   **Sliding Window:** The system must maintain a sliding window of the most recent *N* data points across all sources.
*   **Efficiency:** The `process_data` method should be optimized for speed.  Frequent calls are expected.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of data points and a reasonable number of concurrent sources.
*   **Memory Usage:**  Consider memory usage, especially with large window sizes. Avoid storing unnecessary copies of the data.
*   **Correctness:** The statistical calculations must be accurate. Handle edge cases such as empty windows and windows with a single element correctly.
*   **Real-time:** The system should provide real-time statistics, minimizing the latency between data ingestion and statistic availability.

**Example:**

```python
analyzer = ConcurrentStreamAnalyzer(window_size=5, num_sources=2)

analyzer.process_data(0, 1.0)
analyzer.process_data(1, 2.0)
analyzer.process_data(0, 3.0)
analyzer.process_data(1, 4.0)
analyzer.process_data(0, 5.0)

stats = analyzer.get_statistics()
print(stats)
# Expected output (approximate):
# {'mean': 3.0, 'median': 3.0, 'std_dev': 1.5811, 'min': 1.0, 'max': 5.0}

analyzer.process_data(0, 6.0)
analyzer.process_data(1, 7.0)

stats = analyzer.get_statistics()
print(stats)
# Expected output (approximate):
# {'mean': 5.0, 'median': 5.0, 'std_dev': 2.5819, 'min': 3.0, 'max': 7.0}
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using appropriate data structures for the sliding window that allow efficient insertion and deletion (e.g., a deque).
*   Explore using Python's threading primitives (e.g., `threading.Lock`) to ensure thread safety.
*   Think about how to calculate the median efficiently, possibly without sorting the entire window every time.
*   Consider different approaches for concurrency control to minimize contention and maximize throughput.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and statistical calculations. Good luck!

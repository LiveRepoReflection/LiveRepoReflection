### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal deployment strategy for a new generation of interconnected edge servers within a large, geographically distributed network. The network is represented as a weighted, undirected graph where nodes represent potential server locations and edge weights represent the latency (in milliseconds) between locations.

Your goal is to select a subset of these locations to deploy servers such that the following criteria are met:

1.  **Coverage:** Every node in the network must be within a maximum latency threshold *T* (in milliseconds) of at least one deployed server.  The latency between a node and its nearest server is defined as the shortest path (sum of edge weights) between that node and any deployed server.

2.  **Capacity:** Each server has a limited capacity *C*, representing the maximum number of nodes it can effectively serve within the latency threshold *T*.  A node is considered served by a server if the shortest path between them is no more than *T*.  Each node can only be served by **one** server, even if it is within range of multiple servers.  The assignment of nodes to servers should be done to minimize the overall latency.

3.  **Cost:** Deploying a server at location *i* incurs a cost *cost\[i]*.

Given:

*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the network graph. Keys are node IDs (integers), and values are dictionaries mapping neighbor node IDs to latency (edge weight) values. For example: `{0: {1: 10, 2: 15}, 1: {0: 10, 3: 20}, 2: {0: 15}, 3: {1: 20}}`
*   `T`: The maximum acceptable latency threshold (integer).
*   `C`: The server capacity (integer).
*   `costs`: A list of integers representing the deployment cost for each node. `costs[i]` is the cost of deploying a server at node `i`. The index of cost corresponds to the node id.

Your task is to write a function `find_optimal_deployment(graph, T, C, costs)` that returns a tuple:

1.  A set containing the IDs of the nodes where servers should be deployed to minimize the total deployment cost while satisfying the coverage and capacity constraints. If no deployment can satisfy the constrains, return an empty set.
2.  The total latency of the deployment. The total latency is defined as the sum of the shortest path between each node and its assigned server. If no deployment can satisfy the constrains, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be sparse or dense.
*   Node IDs are integers starting from 0.
*   Edge weights (latencies) are positive integers.
*   `1 <= Number of nodes <= 100`
*   `1 <= T <= 100`
*   `1 <= C <= 20`
*   `1 <= cost[i] <= 100`

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The primary objective is to minimize the total deployment cost.
*   The secondary objective (in case of cost ties) is to minimize the total latency.
*   Solutions should be reasonably efficient.  Brute-force approaches are unlikely to pass all test cases.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Disconnected graphs.
*   Graphs where no solution is possible given *T* and *C*.
*   Graphs where deploying a server at every node is the *only* feasible solution.
*   Multiple optimal solutions with the same deployment cost and latency. Return any one of them.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path), optimization techniques (likely some form of search), and careful handling of constraints. Good luck!

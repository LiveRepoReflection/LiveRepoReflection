## Question: Optimal Public Transit Routing with Real-Time Updates

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a system to find the *optimal* route between two locations in a city using public transportation. The city's public transit system is complex, involving multiple modes of transport (bus, train, subway, tram), each with its own schedule and routes. To further complicate matters, the system needs to handle real-time updates about delays and disruptions.

**Input:**

*   **`stops`:** A dictionary representing all public transport stops in the city. The keys are stop IDs (integers), and the values are tuples `(latitude, longitude)`.
*   **`routes`:** A dictionary representing the public transport routes. The keys are route IDs (integers), and the values are dictionaries with the following keys:
    *   `mode`: A string representing the mode of transport (`"bus"`, `"train"`, `"subway"`, `"tram"`).
    *   `stops`: A list of stop IDs (integers) representing the sequence of stops along the route.
    *   `schedule`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a scheduled departure time from the *first* stop of the route. Each tuple contains `(hour, minute)`.  All times are on a 24-hour clock. The schedule is assumed to repeat every day.
*   **`transfers`:** A dictionary representing allowed transfers between stops. The keys are stop IDs (integers), and the values are a list of stop IDs that can be reached directly from that stop by transferring (walking). Each transfer takes a fixed amount of time, `transfer_time` minutes.
*   **`start_stop`:** The ID (integer) of the starting stop.
*   **`end_stop`:** The ID (integer) of the destination stop.
*   **`start_time`:** The departure time from the `start_stop`, represented as a tuple `(hour, minute)`. All times are on a 24-hour clock.
*   **`current_time`:** The current time, represented as a tuple `(hour, minute)`. All times are on a 24-hour clock. This value is useful for simulating real-time updates.
*   **`delay_updates`:** A list of tuples representing real-time delay updates. Each tuple contains `(route_id, stop_id, delay_minutes)`. This signifies that the specified route is delayed by the given number of minutes at the specified stop.
*   **`transfer_time`:** An integer representing the time (in minutes) it takes to transfer between stops.

**Output:**

The *earliest* arrival time at the `end_stop`, represented as a tuple `(hour, minute)`.  Return `None` if no route exists.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of stops, routes, transfers and delay updates can be large (up to 10<sup>5</sup>).
*   The schedule for each route can be complex, with multiple departure times throughout the day.
*   The system must efficiently handle real-time delay updates.
*   You must minimize the total travel time, including waiting time, travel time on routes, and transfer time. Waiting time is the time spent waiting for the next available departure from a stop.
*   You can assume that all times are within a single day (no overnight travel).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be optimized for speed, especially when handling large datasets and frequent updates.

**Edge Cases:**

*   No route exists between `start_stop` and `end_stop`.
*   `start_stop` and `end_stop` are the same.
*   No transfers are possible.
*   The provided `start_time` is in the past relative to `current_time` (meaning you can only consider departures from `current_time` onwards).

**Real-World Considerations (implicitly tested):**

*   The algorithm should prioritize routes with shorter travel times.
*   The algorithm should consider the impact of transfers on the overall travel time.
*   The algorithm should dynamically adjust routes based on real-time delay updates.
* The solution should not take more than 30 seconds to compute.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:**

*   Consider using efficient graph search algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search.
*   Optimize the data structures used to store the transit information for fast lookups.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, data structure optimization, and careful handling of real-time updates to provide an efficient and accurate public transit routing system. Good luck!

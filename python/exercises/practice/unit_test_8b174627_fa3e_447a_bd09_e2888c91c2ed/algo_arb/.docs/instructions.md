## Question: The Algorithmic Stock Trader's Dilemma

### Question Description

You are developing a sophisticated algorithmic trading system for a high-frequency trading firm. The core of your system revolves around efficiently identifying and exploiting arbitrage opportunities across multiple exchanges.

You are given a stream of real-time stock quotes from `n` different exchanges. Each quote contains the exchange identifier (`exchange_id`), the stock symbol (`stock_symbol`), a timestamp (`timestamp`), the bid price (`bid_price`), and the ask price (`ask_price`).

Your task is to design and implement a system that can continuously detect potential arbitrage opportunities and execute trades to profit from them.  An arbitrage opportunity exists when you can buy a stock on one exchange at a price lower than you can sell it on another exchange, taking into account transaction fees and latency.

**Specifically, you need to:**

1.  **Real-time Quote Processing:** Your system must process incoming stock quotes in real-time. For simplicity, you can simulate this real-time feed using a Python generator that yields quote dictionaries (see Input Format below).

2.  **Arbitrage Detection:** Given the current state of the market (i.e., the most recent quotes for each stock on each exchange), detect all possible arbitrage opportunities. An arbitrage opportunity is defined as a pair of exchanges (exchange_A, exchange_B) for a specific stock symbol where:

    `bid_price(exchange_B) - ask_price(exchange_A) > transaction_fee(exchange_A) + transaction_fee(exchange_B) + latency(exchange_A, exchange_B) + latency(exchange_B, exchange_A)`

    Where:

    *   `bid_price(exchange_B)` is the highest bid price for the stock on exchange B.
    *   `ask_price(exchange_A)` is the lowest ask price for the stock on exchange A.
    *   `transaction_fee(exchange_X)` is the transaction fee for trading on exchange X (given as input).
    *   `latency(exchange_X, exchange_Y)` is the network latency between exchange X and exchange Y (given as input).

3.  **Optimal Trade Execution (Simplified):** For each arbitrage opportunity detected, determine the maximum profit you can make, assuming you can trade up to a volume of `max_trade_volume` (given as input) on each exchange without affecting the prices.  The profit is calculated as:

    `profit = (bid_price(exchange_B) - ask_price(exchange_A) - transaction_fee(exchange_A) - transaction_fee(exchange_B) - latency(exchange_A, exchange_B) - latency(exchange_B, exchange_A)) * min(volume_available_A, volume_available_B, max_trade_volume)`

    You *do not* actually execute the trades. Instead, you return a list of profitable arbitrage opportunities.

4.  **Data Structures and Efficiency:**  The system must be highly efficient, as arbitrage opportunities can disappear within milliseconds. You need to choose appropriate data structures to minimize latency in quote processing and arbitrage detection. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and processing speed.

5.  **Concurrency (Optional, but highly recommended for performance boost):**  The solution should be designed to efficiently handle a large volume of real-time data. Explore the possibility of using concurrency and parallelism to improve performance (e.g., processing quotes from different exchanges concurrently).

6. **Handling Stale Data:** If no quote has been seen from an exchange for a particular stock within `staleness_threshold` milliseconds, consider the quote invalid and do not include it in arbitrage calculations.

**Input Format:**

*   **Quote Stream (Generator):** A generator function that yields dictionaries representing stock quotes. Each dictionary has the following format:

    ```python
    {
        "exchange_id": str,  # Unique identifier for the exchange (e.g., "ExchangeA", "ExchangeB")
        "stock_symbol": str,  # Stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "GOOG")
        "timestamp": int,    # Unix timestamp in milliseconds
        "bid_price": float,  # Highest bid price for the stock
        "ask_price": float,  # Lowest ask price for the stock
        "volume": int       # Available volume at this price
    }
    ```

*   **`transaction_fees` (Dictionary):** A dictionary where keys are exchange IDs and values are the transaction fees for trading on that exchange (float).

    ```python
    {
        "ExchangeA": 0.01,
        "ExchangeB": 0.02,
        ...
    }
    ```

*   **`latency_matrix` (Dictionary of Dictionaries):** A dictionary representing the network latency between exchanges in milliseconds. `latency_matrix[exchange_A][exchange_B]` gives the latency from exchange A to exchange B.

    ```python
    {
        "ExchangeA": {"ExchangeA": 0, "ExchangeB": 5, "ExchangeC": 10},
        "ExchangeB": {"ExchangeA": 5, "ExchangeB": 0, "ExchangeC": 7},
        "ExchangeC": {"ExchangeA": 10, "ExchangeB": 7, "ExchangeC": 0}
        ...
    }
    ```

*   **`max_trade_volume` (Integer):** The maximum volume you can trade on each exchange for each arbitrage opportunity.

*   **`staleness_threshold` (Integer):** Milliseconds. The maximum age a quote can be before it is considered stale.

**Output Format:**

A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a profitable arbitrage opportunity. Each dictionary has the following format:

```python
[
    {
        "stock_symbol": str,      # Stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
        "exchange_A": str,        # Exchange to buy from (e.g., "ExchangeA")
        "exchange_B": str,        # Exchange to sell to (e.g., "ExchangeB")
        "buy_price": float,       # Ask price on exchange_A
        "sell_price": float,      # Bid price on exchange_B
        "profit": float,          # Potential profit from the arbitrage trade
        "volume": int             # Volume to trade to maximize profit (capped by max_trade_volume)
    },
    ...
]
```

**Constraints:**

*   Number of exchanges: 2 <= `n` <= 100
*   Number of stocks: 1 <= `m` <= 1000
*   `0 <= transaction_fee <= 10`
*   `0 <= latency <= 100`
*   `1 <= max_trade_volume <= 1000`
*   `100 <= staleness_threshold <= 5000`
*   The quote stream can contain up to 100,000 quotes.
*   Your solution must be able to process the quote stream and detect arbitrage opportunities within a reasonable time frame (e.g., less than 5 seconds for the entire stream).
*   Assume all prices are positive floats.
*   Assume all volumes are positive integers.

**Example:**

(A simplified example is difficult to construct without providing code, but the above specifications should be sufficiently clear.)

**Grading:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:** The accuracy of arbitrage detection and profit calculation.
*   **Efficiency:** The speed of processing the quote stream and detecting arbitrage opportunities.
*   **Code Quality:** The readability, maintainability, and organization of your code.
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** Properly handling various edge cases, such as empty quote streams, missing data, and zero transaction fees.

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and potentially concurrent programming to achieve optimal performance. Good luck!

# Algorithmic Arbitrage Detection

This project implements a system for detecting arbitrage opportunities across multiple stock exchanges in real-time.

## Overview

The system processes a stream of real-time stock quotes from multiple exchanges and detects opportunities to buy a stock on one exchange at a price lower than it can be sold on another exchange, taking into account transaction fees and latency.

## Functions

### detect_arbitrage_opportunities
The main function that processes a stream of quotes and returns a list of arbitrage opportunities.

### find_arbitrage_opportunities
Analyzes the current state of the market to identify arbitrage opportunities.

### optimize_arbitrage_execution
Optimizes the execution of multiple arbitrage opportunities given capital constraints.

### real_time_arbitrage_monitor
A generator that continually monitors for arbitrage opportunities in real-time.

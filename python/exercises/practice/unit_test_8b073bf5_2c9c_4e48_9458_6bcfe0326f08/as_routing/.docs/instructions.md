Okay, here's a challenging coding problem for a high-level programming competition, focusing on network routing and optimization.

**Problem: Optimal Autonomous System Path Selection**

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a path selection algorithm for an Autonomous System (AS) in the Internet. An AS is a network under a single administrative entity, and it peers with other ASes to exchange traffic. The goal is to choose the best path to a destination AS, considering various business relationships and network conditions.

You are given the following information:

1.  **AS Topology:** The internet topology is represented as a directed graph where nodes are AS numbers (integers), and edges represent peering relationships between ASes. The graph is represented in an adjacency list format.
2.  **Relationship Types:** Each edge in the graph has a relationship type associated with it:
    *   `Customer`: The source AS is a customer of the destination AS (pays the destination AS).
    *   `Peer`: The source AS and destination AS are peers (exchange traffic freely).
    *   `Provider`: The source AS is a provider of the destination AS (the destination AS pays the source AS).
3.  **Traffic Engineering:** Each AS has a traffic engineering policy which is a routing preference that has an impact to the routing decisions and is described below:
    *   **Valley-Free Routing:** ASes prefer paths that do not have a "valley." A valley occurs when a path goes from a customer to a provider and then from a provider back to a customer. Customer-to-Customer relationships are also considered as Valleys. The general Valley-Free routing principle is to avoid paths that traverse from Customer->Provider or Peer->Provider.
4.  **AS metrics:** Each AS has associated cost metrics, such as latency (in milliseconds).
5.  **Destination AS:** You are given a target AS number to which you need to find the optimal path.
6.  **Origin AS:** You are given the current AS number which needs to determine the path to send traffic.

Your task is to implement a function that, given the AS topology, relationship types, AS metrics (latency), a destination AS, and origin AS, finds the "best" path from the origin AS to the destination AS, according to the following criteria, in order of priority:

1.  **Reachability:** The path must exist (i.e., there must be a route from the origin to the destination).
2.  **Valley-Free Preference:** Prefer paths that adhere to the valley-free routing principle. You should strongly discourage (but not necessarily eliminate if no other path exists) paths with valleys. Note that Customer-to-Customer relationships is considered a valley.
3.  **Lowest Latency:** Among valley-free (or least-valley-containing) paths, choose the path with the lowest total latency. The latency of a path is the sum of the latencies of the ASes on the path (including the origin and destination).
4.  **Shortest AS Path Length:** In case of a tie of latency, choose the path with the shortest AS path length.

Your function should return a list of AS numbers representing the optimal path from the origin to the destination. If no path exists, return an empty list.

**Input Format:**

*   `topology`: A dictionary/hashmap where keys are AS numbers (integers), and values are lists of tuples. Each tuple represents a neighbor and the relationship type: `(neighbor_as_number, relationship_type)`.
    *   `relationship_type` is an enum or string with values: `"customer"`, `"peer"`, `"provider"`.
    *   Example: `{1: [(2, "customer"), (3, "peer")], 2: [(1, "provider")]}`
*   `as_metrics`: A dictionary/hashmap where keys are AS numbers (integers), and values are latency in milliseconds (integers).
    *   Example: `{1: 20, 2: 30, 3: 15}`
*   `origin_as`: The origin AS number (integer).
*   `destination_as`: The destination AS number (integer).

**Output Format:**

*   A list of AS numbers (integers) representing the optimal path from the origin to the destination AS.
*   Return an empty list if no path exists.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of ASes (nodes in the graph) can be up to 10,000.
*   The latency values are non-negative integers.
*   You need to find an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, as naive approaches might time out.  Consider using graph traversal algorithms with appropriate optimizations.
*   If multiple paths have the exact same valley count and latency, return the one with shortest AS Path Length.

**Example:**

```python
topology = {
    1: [(2, "customer"), (3, "peer")],
    2: [(1, "provider"), (4, "customer")],
    3: [(1, "peer"), (4, "provider"), (5, "customer")],
    4: [(2, "provider"), (3, "customer"), (6, "peer")],
    5: [(3, "provider")],
    6: [(4, "peer")]
}
as_metrics = {
    1: 20,
    2: 30,
    3: 15,
    4: 25,
    5: 40,
    6: 10
}
origin_as = 1
destination_as = 6

# Possible paths:
# 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 (Valley-free, latency: 20 + 15 + 25 + 10 = 70)
# 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 (Valley: 1->2(customer to provider), 2->4(customer to provider); latency: 20 + 30 + 25 + 10 = 85)

# Expected Output: [1, 3, 4, 6]
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, path scoring based on multiple criteria, and optimization to handle potentially large graphs. Good luck!

## Question: Optimal Network Segmentation

**Description:**

A large multinational corporation, "GlobalCorp," is concerned about increasing cybersecurity threats. They want to segment their internal network to limit the blast radius of potential attacks. You are tasked with designing an algorithm to determine the optimal network segmentation strategy.

GlobalCorp's network consists of `n` devices, each represented by a unique integer ID from `0` to `n-1`. The network's connectivity is defined by a set of `m` bidirectional connections between devices. You are given this connectivity information as a list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a connection between device `u` and device `v`.

GlobalCorp wants to divide the network into `k` segments. Each device must belong to exactly one segment. The goal is to minimize the number of **cross-segment connections**. A cross-segment connection is a connection `(u, v)` where device `u` and device `v` belong to different segments.

Additionally, GlobalCorp has identified a set of `p` critical device pairs that must *not* be in the same segment. These are represented as a list of tuples `(a, b)`, where devices `a` and `b` cannot be placed in the same segment.

Finally, each segment must contain *at least* `min_size` devices and *at most* `max_size` devices.

**Objective:**

Write a function `segment_network(n, connections, k, critical_pairs, min_size, max_size)` that takes the following arguments:

*   `n`: The number of devices in the network (an integer).
*   `connections`: A list of tuples representing the bidirectional connections between devices. Each tuple is of the form `(u, v)`, where `u` and `v` are device IDs (integers from `0` to `n-1`).
*   `k`: The desired number of network segments (an integer).
*   `critical_pairs`: A list of tuples representing critical device pairs that must not be in the same segment. Each tuple is of the form `(a, b)`, where `a` and `b` are device IDs (integers from `0` to `n-1`).
*   `min_size`: The minimum number of devices allowed in each segment (an integer).
*   `max_size`: The maximum number of devices allowed in each segment (an integer).

Your function should return a list of `k` sets, where each set represents a network segment containing device IDs. The segments should satisfy the following conditions:

1.  Each device belongs to exactly one segment.
2.  The number of cross-segment connections is minimized.
3.  No critical device pair is in the same segment.
4.  Each segment contains at least `min_size` devices and at most `max_size` devices.

If no valid segmentation is possible, return `None`.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `2 <= k <= n / min_size`
*   `1 <= p <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `1 <= min_size <= n / k`
*   `n / k <= max_size <= n`
*   Device IDs are integers in the range `[0, n-1]`.
*   Connections are bidirectional (if `(u, v)` is in `connections`, `(v, u)` is also a valid connection).
*   Critical pairs are unordered (if `(a, b)` is in `critical_pairs`, `(b, a)` is considered the same pair).
*   There are no duplicate connections or critical pairs.
*   All inputs are valid according to the descriptions above.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1-2 minutes). Consider algorithmic complexity and optimization techniques to improve performance.  Brute-force approaches are unlikely to succeed.

**Example:**

```python
n = 6
connections = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (0, 3)]
k = 2
critical_pairs = [(0, 5), (1, 4)]
min_size = 2
max_size = 4

result = segment_network(n, connections, k, critical_pairs, min_size, max_size)

# One possible valid result:
# [{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}]
# The cross-segment connections would be (0,3) which is 1.

# Another possible valid result:
# [{0, 1, 3}, {2, 4, 5}]
# The cross-segment connections would be (0,2), (3,4), (3,5), (1,2) which is 4.

# The optimal is to have fewer cross-segment connections.
```

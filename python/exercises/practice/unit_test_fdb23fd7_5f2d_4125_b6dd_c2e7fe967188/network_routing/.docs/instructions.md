`NetworkRouteOptimizer`

## Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing the routing of data packets within a complex communication network. The network consists of `n` nodes, uniquely identified by integers from `0` to `n-1`. The connections between nodes are represented by a set of bidirectional edges, each having a cost associated with it, representing latency, bandwidth usage, or monetary cost. Multiple edges can exist between two nodes, each with a potentially different cost.

Given a set of data packets that need to be transmitted between specified source and destination nodes, your goal is to determine the optimal routing path for each packet to minimize the overall network cost.

**Specifically, you need to implement a function that:**

1.  Takes as input:

    *   `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the network.
    *   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, cost)` represents a bidirectional edge between node `u` and node `v` with a cost of `cost`. `u` and `v` are integers representing the node IDs, and `cost` is a non-negative floating-point number representing the cost of traversing the edge.
    *   `packets`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(source, destination, data_size)` represents a data packet that needs to be transmitted from node `source` to node `destination` with a size of `data_size`. `source` and `destination` are integers representing the node IDs, and `data_size` is a positive integer representing the amount of data in bytes.

2.  For each packet, determine the lowest-cost path from its source to its destination.

3.  If no path exists between the source and destination for a packet, return `None` for that packet.

4.  Return a list of paths, where each path is a list of node IDs representing the optimal route for the corresponding packet. If no path exists, the corresponding element in the list should be `None`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Network Size:** The network can be large, with up to 10,000 nodes and 100,000 edges.
*   **Number of Packets:** There can be up to 1,000 packets to route.
*   **Edge Costs:** Edge costs can be any non-negative floating-point number.
*   **Multiple Edges:** The graph can contain multiple edges between the same two nodes with different costs. You should consider all edges when finding the shortest path.
*   **Path Optimality:** The solution must find the absolute lowest-cost path for each packet, not just a "good" path.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** The solution should be memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large networks. Avoid storing redundant data.
*   **Time Efficiency:** The solution must be time-efficient. Naive algorithms like brute-force search will not pass the time limit.  Consider using efficient graph traversal algorithms and potentially heuristics.
*   **Real-World Data Size Consideration:**  The `data_size` of a packet does not directly influence the path cost calculation itself. However, the *number* of packets routed through any given edge will influence the overall network load and cost (see below).
*   **Network Congestion Cost:** The cost of an edge is affected by the number of packets routed through it. For each edge `(u, v)`, after determining the shortest paths for all packets, calculate the total number of packets routed through the edge `(u, v)` and the edge `(v, u)`. Let this number be `packet_count`.  The *final* cost of an edge is `original_cost * (1 + packet_count / 1000)`. Your function should minimize the total *final* cost of the network. This means that finding the shortest paths initially is not enough; you will need to potentially reroute packets to minimize the network congestion cost.
*   **Cycle Detection:**  The network may contain cycles. Your algorithm should handle cycles correctly and avoid infinite loops.
*   **Disconnected Graph:** The graph may be disconnected; therefore, no path might exist between certain source and destination nodes.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 1.0), (0, 2, 2.0), (1, 2, 0.5), (1, 3, 3.0), (2, 3, 1.5), (3, 4, 0.8)]
packets = [(0, 4, 100), (1, 4, 200), (0, 3, 50)]

# Expected output (example - actual paths may vary based on congestion cost optimization):
# [[0, 1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 4], [0, 1, 2, 3]]
```

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and the ability to balance time and memory efficiency. Good luck!

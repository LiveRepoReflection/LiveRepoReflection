## Project Name

`OptimalMeetingScheduler`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building an optimal meeting scheduler for a large corporation with a complex hierarchical structure. The corporation consists of employees organized in a tree-like structure, where each employee (node) has a unique ID, a department, and a list of subordinate employees (children).

Given a request to schedule a meeting involving a specific set of employees (attendees), your goal is to find the **smallest possible subtree** of the corporate hierarchy that contains all the required attendees. This subtree will be the meeting scope, minimizing unnecessary participation and maximizing efficiency.

Specifically, your task is to implement a function that takes the root of the corporate hierarchy (a tree node), a list of employee IDs representing the attendees, and returns the root node of the smallest subtree that contains all attendees. The subtree must include all attendees, but can include additional employees (nodes) if necessary to maintain the tree structure.

**Input:**

*   `root`: The root node of the corporate hierarchy represented as a tree. Each node in the tree has the following attributes:
    *   `employee_id`: A unique integer representing the employee's ID.
    *   `department`: A string representing the employee's department.
    *   `children`: A list of child nodes (subordinates). This list can be empty.
*   `attendees`: A list of integers representing the employee IDs of the required meeting attendees.

**Output:**

*   The root node of the smallest subtree that contains all the attendees.

**Constraints:**

*   The corporate hierarchy can be very large (thousands of employees).
*   The number of attendees can vary significantly (from a few to hundreds).
*   The employee IDs are unique.
*   All attendee IDs are guaranteed to exist within the corporate hierarchy.
*   The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Aim for a solution better than O(N*M) where N is the number of nodes in the tree and M is the number of attendees.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Handle the case where the `attendees` list is empty.
*   Consider the scenario where certain departments have higher communication overhead. Modify your solution to prioritize subtrees that minimize the inclusion of employees from those departments (e.g., by assigning weights to departments).
*   Implement a mechanism to handle dynamic updates to the corporate hierarchy (e.g., employee promotions, new hires, departmental restructuring) and ensure the meeting scheduler remains efficient.

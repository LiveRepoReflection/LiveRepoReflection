Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging and require a sophisticated approach in Python:

**Problem: Decentralized Social Network Analytics**

**Description:**

You are building an analytics platform for a decentralized social network. The network consists of users and their connections (followers/following). The network is partitioned across multiple independent servers (shards). Each server holds partial information about the network: a subset of users and the connections between those users *within that shard*. Crucially, connections can exist *between* shards, but a single shard doesn't know the global network structure.

You are given a list of shards. Each shard is represented as a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    "shard_id": int,
    "users": set[str],  # Set of user IDs in this shard
    "connections": list[tuple[str, str]] # List of (user_id_1, user_id_2) tuples, representing a directed connection from user_id_1 to user_id_2.  Both user_id_1 and user_id_2 are guaranteed to be in the shard's 'users' set.
}
```

Your task is to implement a function `analyze_network(shards, queries)` that efficiently answers a series of analytical `queries` about the *global* decentralized social network.

A `query` is a dictionary with one of the following types:

1.  **Reachability Query:**

    ```python
    {
        "type": "reachability",
        "user_a": str,
        "user_b": str,
        "max_hops": int
    }
    ```

    Determine if `user_b` is reachable from `user_a` within `max_hops` in the *global* social network. A hop represents traversing a single connection. The function should return `True` if reachable, `False` otherwise. If either `user_a` or `user_b` does not exist in the global network, return `False`.

2.  **Influencer Score Query:**

    ```python
    {
        "type": "influencer_score",
        "user": str,
        "hop_limit": int
    }
    ```

    Calculate an "influencer score" for the given `user`. The influencer score is the number of *distinct* users reachable from the given `user` within `hop_limit` hops, *excluding* the user itself. Return 0 if the user doesn't exist in the global network.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of shards can be large (up to 1000).
*   Each shard can contain a large number of users and connections (up to 10,000 users, 100,000 connections).
*   The number of queries can be large (up to 10,000).
*   User IDs are strings.
*   The `max_hops` and `hop_limit` are integers.
*   Efficiency is critical. Naive solutions that repeatedly traverse the shards for each query will likely time out.
*   You must handle the fact that the network is distributed and information is incomplete within each shard.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement the `analyze_network` function in Python.
*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the large input sizes within a reasonable time limit.  Consider pre-processing the shard data to optimize query performance.
*   Assume that shard data is static, meaning it does not change between queries.

This problem is designed to be challenging because it requires:

*   Combining data from multiple sources (shards).
*   Efficient graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, or similar).
*   Careful consideration of data structures to optimize performance (e.g., using sets for efficient membership testing).
*   Handling potentially large datasets and a significant number of queries.
*   Thinking about the distributed nature of the data and how to minimize cross-shard communication (even though direct inter-shard communication is not needed in the code, the algorithm should be designed to minimize the amount of data loaded/processed for each query).

Good luck!

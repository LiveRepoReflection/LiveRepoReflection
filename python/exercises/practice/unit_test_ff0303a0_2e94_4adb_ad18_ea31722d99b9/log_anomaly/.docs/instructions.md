Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated, drawing inspiration from real-world scenarios and demanding efficient algorithmic solutions.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Log Aggregation and Anomaly Detection

**Problem Description:**

You are building a distributed log aggregation and anomaly detection system.  Numerous microservices across a large-scale distributed system generate logs continuously. Your task is to design and implement a system to efficiently collect, aggregate, and analyze these logs to identify anomalies in real-time.

**System Components:**

1.  **Log Producers:**  Assume a large number (potentially thousands) of microservices are acting as log producers. Each microservice generates log entries with the following format:

    ```json
    {
        "timestamp": <unix timestamp in milliseconds>,
        "service_name": <string, name of the microservice>,
        "log_level": <string, one of "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR">,
        "message": <string, the log message>,
        "metrics": <dictionary, key-value pairs of numerical metrics relevant to the service.  e.g., {"cpu_usage": 0.75, "memory_usage": 0.60, "request_latency": 0.12}>
    }
    ```

2.  **Log Aggregators:** A cluster of log aggregator nodes receives logs from the producers. These aggregators are responsible for buffering, pre-processing, and forwarding logs to the central analysis system.

3.  **Central Analysis System:** This is the core of the system. It receives aggregated logs from the aggregators and performs anomaly detection based on the provided metrics.

**Your Task:**

Implement the `CentralAnalysisSystem` class with the following functionalities:

*   **Initialization:** The constructor takes a single argument: `anomaly_threshold`. This is a floating-point value representing the threshold above which a metric is considered anomalous.

*   **`process_logs(logs)`:** This method receives a list of log entries (represented as dictionaries).  It should perform the following steps:

    1.  **Aggregation:** Group the logs by `service_name` and calculate the *average* value for each metric specified in the `"metrics"` field for each service over a *sliding time window* of 60 seconds.  For example, if a service reports CPU usage metrics of `0.7`, `0.8`, and `0.9` within the window, the aggregated CPU usage for that service would be `0.8`.  If a service reports no metrics in the sliding window, skip it.

    2.  **Anomaly Detection:** For each service and each metric, compare the *current* average value (calculated in step 1) with the *historical average* of that metric for that service.  The historical average is maintained for each service and metric. A metric is considered anomalous if the absolute difference between the current average and the historical average exceeds the `anomaly_threshold`.

    3.  **Reporting:** Return a list of anomaly reports. Each anomaly report should be a dictionary with the following format:

        ```json
        {
            "service_name": <string>,
            "metric_name": <string>,
            "current_value": <float>,
            "historical_average": <float>,
            "difference": <float>,
            "timestamp": <unix timestamp in milliseconds of the *latest* log entry used to calculate the current value>
        }
        ```

        The list should be sorted by timestamp in descending order (most recent first).

    4.  **Historical Average Update:** After reporting anomalies, update the historical average for each service and metric used in the aggregation. The new historical average should be calculated as a simple moving average: `new_historical_average = (historical_average * (N-1) + current_value) / N`, where N is a constant value of 100 (to simulate some long-term memory). Initialize the historical average to 0.0 for any new service-metric combination.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Real-time Performance:** The `process_logs` method must be efficient enough to handle a large volume of logs in real-time.  Consider algorithmic complexity and efficient data structures.
*   **Sliding Window:** Implement the 60-second sliding window efficiently. You should not recalculate the averages from scratch for each new log entry.
*   **Data Structures:**  Choose appropriate data structures to store historical averages, aggregated metrics, and sliding window data.  Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and performance.
*   **Concurrency:** While you don't need to implement actual multithreading, consider how your design would scale to handle concurrent log ingestion from multiple aggregators.  Think about thread safety and potential bottlenecks.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where a service reports no metrics, reports metrics with invalid values (e.g., non-numerical), or experiences significant changes in metric behavior.
*   **Timestamp Ordering:**  Logs may not arrive in perfect timestamp order.  Your sliding window implementation must account for this.

**Example:**

Let's say `anomaly_threshold = 0.5`.

Initial `CentralAnalysisSystem(anomaly_threshold=0.5)`

A service named `auth-service` reports CPU usage of 0.2.  The historical average is 0.0.  The difference is `|0.2 - 0.0| = 0.2`, which is less than the threshold. No anomaly is reported.  The historical average is updated to `(0.0 * 99 + 0.2) / 100 = 0.002`.

Later, `auth-service` reports CPU usage of 0.9. The historical average is 0.002. The difference is `|0.9 - 0.002| = 0.898`, which is greater than the threshold. An anomaly is reported. The historical average is updated to `(0.002 * 99 + 0.9) / 100 = 0.00908`.

**This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques to achieve real-time performance and accurate anomaly detection in a distributed environment.**

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal pathing system for a large-scale data network. The network consists of `n` nodes (numbered 0 to `n-1`) interconnected by a set of bidirectional links. Each link has a latency associated with it, representing the time it takes for data to travel across that link. Each node is also assigned a risk factor, which defines the probability of data corruption at that node.

Given the network topology, node risk factors, a source node `s`, and a destination node `d`, your goal is to find the path between `s` and `d` that minimizes a combined cost function. This cost function considers both the total latency of the path and the cumulative risk associated with traversing the nodes on the path.

Specifically, the cost function is defined as follows:

`Cost(path) = TotalLatency(path) + RiskWeight * CumulativeRisk(path)`

Where:

*   `TotalLatency(path)` is the sum of latencies of all links in the path.
*   `CumulativeRisk(path)` is the sum of risk factors of all nodes in the path (including the source and destination).
*   `RiskWeight` is a constant that determines the relative importance of risk compared to latency.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= `n` <= 1000).
*   `links`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, latency)` represents a bidirectional link between node `u` and node `v` with the given `latency` (0 <= `u`, `v` < `n`, 1 <= `latency` <= 100). There can be multiple links between two nodes, and self-loops are possible.
*   `risk_factors`: A list of integers, where `risk_factors[i]` represents the risk factor of node `i` (0 <= `risk_factors[i]` <= 100).
*   `s`: The source node (0 <= `s` < `n`).
*   `d`: The destination node (0 <= `d` < `n`).
*   `RiskWeight`: A non-negative floating point number representing the weight given to risk in the cost function (0 <= `RiskWeight` <= 1000).

**Output:**

Return the minimum cost of any path between the source node `s` and the destination node `d`. If no path exists between `s` and `d`, return -1.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** The solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of nodes and links. Consider the time complexity of your chosen algorithm.
*   **Multiple Paths:** There can be multiple paths between the source and destination. Your algorithm must explore enough paths to find the optimal one.
*   **Cycles:** The network may contain cycles. Your algorithm must handle cycles without getting stuck in infinite loops.
*   **Disconnected Graph:** The graph may be disconnected. You should return -1 if there's no path between the source and destination.
*   **Floating Point Precision:** Be mindful of floating-point precision issues when calculating the cost. Avoid direct equality comparisons between floating-point numbers. Use a tolerance value (e.g., 1e-6) for comparisons.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as source and destination being the same node, empty links list, etc.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
links = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 15), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 12), (2, 4, 10), (3, 4, 8)]
risk_factors = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
s = 0
d = 4
RiskWeight = 2.0

Output: 52.0

Explanation:
One optimal path is 0 -> 2 -> 4.
Total Latency = 15 + 10 = 25
Cumulative Risk = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
Cost = 25 + (2.0 * 9) = 43

Another path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4
Total Latency = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25
Cumulative Risk = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11
Cost = 25 + (2.0 * 11) = 47

Another Path 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
Total Latency = 10 + 12 + 8 = 30
Cumulative Risk = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12
Cost = 30 + (2.0 * 12) = 54

Optimal path is 0 -> 2 -> 4 with cost 43.0
```

**Note:** Your solution will be evaluated based on its correctness, efficiency, and ability to handle various edge cases.

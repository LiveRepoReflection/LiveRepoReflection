## Problem: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Simulation

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with simulating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) responsible for managing a large, distributed network of critical infrastructure nodes. The DAO operates using a voting system where token holders propose and vote on changes to the network's configuration and operation. Due to the network's critical nature, changes must be carefully considered and implemented with minimal disruption.

The network consists of `N` nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from 0 to N-1. The network's connectivity is represented by a graph.  Each node has a performance score and a set of dependent nodes. The DAO uses a proposal system where token holders can submit proposals to modify node parameters.

Your system must handle the following types of proposals:

1.  **Node Performance Boost:** Increase the performance score of a specific node by a percentage.
2.  **Connectivity Reconfiguration:** Add or remove a connection (edge) between two nodes in the network.
3.  **Node Dependency Update:** Update a node's dependencies.

The DAO uses a quadratic voting system. Each proposal has a cost, and token holders can vote "yes" or "no" on a proposal. The cost of casting `x` votes is `x^2`. Each token holder has a limited voting power.

The DAO has a set of constraints that must be satisfied before a proposal can be implemented:

*   **Quorum:** A minimum percentage of token holders must participate in the vote for the proposal to be considered valid.
*   **Approval Threshold:** The percentage of "yes" votes must exceed a certain threshold for the proposal to pass.
*   **Dependency Stability:** Implementing a proposal must not destabilize the network.  A network is considered destabilized if any node's performance drops below a critical threshold due to dependencies on other nodes. A node's performance is affected by its dependencies; if a node depends on another node with a significantly lower performance, the dependent node's performance will also be negatively impacted. The influence of dependencies are calculated as follows:

    *   Each node `i` has a base performance score `P_i`.
    *   Each node `i` also has a set of dependencies: `D_i = {j1, j2, ..., jk}`.
    *   The adjusted performance `A_i` of node `i` is calculated as:
        ```
        A_i = P_i * (1 - influence_factor * max(0, (average_dependency_performance - P_i) / P_i))
        ```
        where:
        *   `average_dependency_performance` is the average performance score of all nodes in `D_i`. If `D_i` is empty, the average is `P_i`.
        *   `influence_factor` is a global constant representing the influence of dependencies on node performance.
    *   A network is considered stable if all nodes' adjusted performance `A_i` is greater than or equal to a pre-defined critical threshold `T`.

Your task is to implement a function that simulates the DAO's voting process and determines whether a proposal should be implemented.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (integer).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the initial network connectivity. Each tuple `(u, v)` indicates an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`.
*   `node_performances`: A list of floats representing the initial performance scores of the nodes. `node_performances[i]` is the performance score of node `i`.
*   `node_dependencies`: A list of lists representing the dependencies of each node. `node_dependencies[i]` is a list of node IDs that node `i` depends on.
*   `proposal`: A dictionary representing the proposal. The dictionary contains the following keys:
    *   `type`: A string representing the type of proposal ("boost", "reconfigure", "dependency").
    *   `node_id`: An integer representing the ID of the node affected by the proposal (if applicable).
    *   `percentage`: A float representing the percentage increase in performance (for "boost" proposals).
    *   `node1`: An integer representing the ID of the first node involved in connectivity changes (for "reconfigure" proposals).
    *   `node2`: An integer representing the ID of the second node involved in connectivity changes (for "reconfigure" proposals).
    *   `add_connection`: A boolean indicating whether to add or remove the connection (for "reconfigure" proposals).
     *  `new_dependencies`: A list of integers representing the new dependencies of a node.
*   `votes`: A list of integers representing the votes cast by token holders. Positive values represent "yes" votes, and negative values represent "no" votes. The absolute value of each vote represents the number of tokens used to cast that vote.
*   `total_tokens`: The total number of tokens in the DAO (integer).
*   `quorum_threshold`: The minimum percentage of total tokens that must be used to vote for the proposal to be valid (float between 0 and 1).
*   `approval_threshold`: The minimum percentage of "yes" votes required for the proposal to pass (float between 0 and 1).
*   `influence_factor`: A float representing the influence of dependencies on node performance.
*   `critical_threshold`: A float representing the minimum acceptable adjusted performance for each node.

**Output:**

*   A boolean indicating whether the proposal should be implemented (`True` if the proposal passes and does not destabilize the network, `False` otherwise).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `0 <= node_performances[i] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= len(node_dependencies[i]) <= N`
*   `-1000 <= votes[i] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= total_tokens <= 1000000`
*   `0 <= quorum_threshold <= 1`
*   `0 <= approval_threshold <= 1`
*   `0 <= influence_factor <= 1`
*   `0 <= critical_threshold <= 1000`
*   The graph is undirected.
*   Dependencies can form cycles.
*   You should handle potential division by zero errors gracefully.

**Example:**

(A more concrete example with all input values will be provided in the actual test cases, as it would be quite long to include here).

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:** The solution must correctly determine whether a proposal should be implemented based on the given constraints.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given input size within a reasonable time limit.  Consider algorithmic complexity and optimization.
*   **Robustness:** The solution should handle edge cases and invalid input gracefully.
*   **Code Clarity:** The code should be well-structured and easy to understand.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and simulation techniques.  It challenges the solver to consider multiple factors and constraints to arrive at the correct decision. The dependency stability calculation adds a layer of complexity, requiring careful consideration of interconnected node performances. The quadratic voting system also requires careful handling of the votes and token calculations. Good luck!

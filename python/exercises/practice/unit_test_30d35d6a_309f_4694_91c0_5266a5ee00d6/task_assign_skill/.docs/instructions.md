Okay, here's a challenging Python coding problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and a real-world scenario.

**Problem Title: Optimal Task Assignment with Skill Dependencies**

**Problem Description:**

You are developing a task management system for a large organization. The organization has `n` employees and `m` tasks that need to be completed. Each employee has a specific set of skills, and each task requires a specific set of skills to be completed. An employee can only work on a task if they possess all the skills required for that task.

The tasks also have dependencies. Task `A` can only be started after task `B` is completed. These dependencies are represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Your goal is to assign tasks to employees in a way that minimizes the total completion time. Each employee can only work on one task at a time. The completion time for a task is the time it takes for an employee to complete the task, which is given as input.

**Input:**

1.  `employees`: A list of sets. `employees[i]` represents the set of skills possessed by the i-th employee.
2.  `tasks`: A list of tuples. `tasks[i] = (skills, time)`. `skills` is a set representing the skills required for the i-th task, and `time` is the time it takes to complete the task.
3.  `dependencies`: A list of tuples. `dependencies[i] = (task1, task2)` represents a dependency where task `task1` must be completed before task `task2` can start. Tasks are represented by their index in the `tasks` list (0-indexed).
4.  `n`: Number of employees.
5.  `m`: Number of tasks.

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum total completion time for all tasks, considering skill requirements, task dependencies, and employee availability. Return `-1` if it's impossible to complete all tasks.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= n <= 100 (Number of Employees)
*   1 <= m <= 100 (Number of Tasks)
*   The number of skills for each employee and task is limited.
*   The `dependencies` list represents a valid DAG. No cycles are present.
*   The `time` for each task is a positive integer.
*   The sets of skills are represented using strings.
*   Optimize for time complexity. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.
*   Consider the complexities of optimal task scheduling under precedence constraints and resource constraints.

**Example:**

```python
employees = [
    {"A", "B"},
    {"B", "C"}
]
tasks = [
    ({"A"}, 5),
    ({"B"}, 10),
    ({"C"}, 7)
]
dependencies = [
    (0, 1),  # Task 0 depends on Task 1
    (1, 2)   # Task 1 depends on Task 2
]
n = len(employees) #2
m = len(tasks) #3

#Expected output: 22
#Optimal assignment:
#Employee 0: Task 0 (time 5), then Task 1 (time 10)
#Employee 1: Task 2 (time 7)
#Total time: 5 + 10 + 7 = 22
```

**Additional Considerations (to make it even harder):**

*   **Limited Employee Availability:** Extend the `employees` input to include an availability schedule (e.g., `employees[i] = (skills, availability)` where `availability` is a list of time intervals when the employee is available).

This problem requires a combination of topological sorting (due to dependencies), checking skill requirements, and an optimization strategy to minimize the overall completion time, making it a challenging and sophisticated task. Good luck!

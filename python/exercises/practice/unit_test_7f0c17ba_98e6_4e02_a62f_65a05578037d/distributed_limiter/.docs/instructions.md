Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging programming competition problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter.  Imagine a system with a large number of clients making requests to a set of identical servers.  To prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation, you need to limit the rate at which each client can make requests across the entire system, not just to a single server.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Client Identification:** Each client is uniquely identified by a string.

2.  **Rate Limit Definition:** The rate limit is defined as a maximum number of requests (`max_requests`) within a specified time window (`time_window_seconds`).  For example, a rate limit of 10 requests per 60 seconds means a client cannot make more than 10 requests in any 60-second period.

3.  **Distributed Enforcement:** The rate limiter must work correctly even when requests from the same client are handled by different servers.  This implies the need for a shared, consistent state.

4.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests efficiently.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be designed to tolerate temporary failures of individual servers. The overall system should continue to function correctly.

6.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be scalable to handle a large number of clients and requests per second.

7.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter must be efficient in terms of both memory usage and processing time.  Excessive latency or memory consumption is unacceptable.

8.  **Near Real-time Accuracy:** While perfect accuracy isn't required, the rate limiter should strive to be as accurate as possible in enforcing the limits.  Occasional bursts slightly exceeding the limit are acceptable, but they should be rare.

9. **Request Object:** The requests will be represented by a generic class `Request`, and are timestamped upon creation.

**Implementation Details:**

*   You are free to choose the underlying data store and synchronization mechanisms.  Consider options like Redis, Memcached, or a distributed database.
*   Your solution should include clear explanations of the design choices, including the rationale for selecting the chosen data store and synchronization method.
*   You should provide a high-level overview of the system architecture.
*   Your solution should include a `RateLimiter` class with the following methods:

    *   `__init__(self, max_requests: int, time_window_seconds: int)`:  Initializes the rate limiter with the specified limits.
    *   `allow_request(self, client_id: str, request: Request) -> bool`:  Checks if a request from the given client is allowed based on the rate limit.  Returns `True` if the request is allowed, `False` otherwise.  This method must be thread-safe.
    *   `clear_client(self, client_id: str)`: Clears the request history of the given client. Useful for testing and administrative purposes.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be implemented in Python.
*   Avoid using external libraries for core rate-limiting logic (e.g., don't just wrap an existing rate-limiting library). The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of distributed rate limiting principles.  Using libraries for data storage or communication is acceptable and encouraged.
*   The solution should be well-documented and easy to understand.
*   The solution should be testable. Although I will not ask for unit tests at this stage, the design should be amenable to testing.
*   Assume that the number of clients can be very large (millions or billions).
*   Assume that the system handles a high volume of requests (thousands or tens of thousands per second).
*   Consider the cost implications of your design choices.  Try to minimize the cost of storing and processing the rate limiting data.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The rate limiter must accurately enforce the specified limits.
*   Efficiency: The rate limiter must be efficient in terms of memory usage and processing time.
*   Scalability: The rate limiter must be scalable to handle a large number of clients and requests.
*   Fault Tolerance: The rate limiter must be fault-tolerant.
*   Design Clarity: The design must be well-documented and easy to understand.
*   Adherence to Constraints: The solution must adhere to the specified constraints.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, and data structures. It challenges the solver to make informed design choices and implement a robust and scalable solution. Good luck!

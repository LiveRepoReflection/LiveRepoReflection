Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world constraints.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Validation**

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a large, distributed financial system where transactions are processed across multiple independent services. Each service maintains its own local database and has limited knowledge of the overall system state. To ensure data consistency, transactions need to be validated across these services.

You are given a directed graph representing dependencies between services involved in a financial transaction. Each node in the graph represents a service, and a directed edge from service A to service B indicates that service A's transaction depends on the successful completion and validation of service B's transaction.

Each service, when processing a transaction, can either:

1.  **Commit:** Successfully process and validate the transaction.
2.  **Abort:** Fail to process and validate the transaction.

If a service aborts a transaction, all services that depend on it (i.e., services reachable from it in the dependency graph) must also abort to maintain consistency.

Your task is to design and implement an efficient algorithm to determine whether a given transaction can be successfully committed across all involved services, given the following constraints:

*   **Partial Information:** You only have access to the *initial state* of each service, which can be either "READY" (service is ready to process the transaction) or "ABORTED" (service has already aborted and cannot commit).
*   **Limited Communication:** Services can only communicate with their direct dependencies (outgoing edges in the graph). Direct dependencies can instantly communicate their transaction status to their depending services.
*   **Transaction Propagation:** If a service aborts, it propagates the abort signal to all its direct dependencies.  This abort signal must be propagated transitively.
*   **Cycles:** The dependency graph may contain cycles, representing circular dependencies. These cycles introduce significant complexity as services within a cycle might need to make coordinated decisions.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of services (nodes in the graph). Services are numbered from 0 to n-1.
*   `dependencies`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(a, b)` represents a directed edge from service `a` to service `b` (service `a` depends on service `b`).
*   `initial_states`: A list of strings, where `initial_states[i]` is either "READY" or "ABORTED", representing the initial state of service `i`.

**Output:**

*   Return `True` if it is possible for all services to eventually commit the transaction (i.e., no service is forced to abort). Return `False` if at least one service will inevitably abort based on the initial states and dependencies.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= len(dependencies) <= 2 * 10^5`
*   The graph can be disconnected.
*   The graph can contain cycles.
*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large graphs (optimize for both time and space complexity).
*   You cannot directly modify the `initial_states` list.

**Example:**

```
n = 4
dependencies = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 1)]
initial_states = ["READY", "READY", "ABORTED", "READY"]

Output: False
```

Explanation: Service 2 is initially aborted. Services 0 and 1 depend on service 2, so they must also abort. Service 3 depends on service 1, so it must abort. Therefore, it is not possible for all services to commit.

This problem requires careful consideration of graph traversal algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS), cycle detection, and efficient propagation of abort signals. The key is to determine whether the initial "ABORTED" states will inevitably cascade and force all services to abort, or if the "READY" services can somehow "overcome" the aborted ones. Good luck!

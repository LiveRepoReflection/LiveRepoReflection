### Question Description

You are building a real-time analytics platform that processes a continuous stream of events from a distributed system. The system consists of numerous worker nodes, each generating events related to various metrics. Your task is to implement a distributed aggregation system that efficiently computes the **k-th smallest value** for each metric across all worker nodes within a specified time window.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Event Structure:** Each event is a dictionary with the following structure:

    ```python
    {
        "timestamp": int,  # Unix timestamp in seconds
        "worker_id": str, # Unique identifier for the worker node
        "metric_name": str, # Name of the metric (e.g., "CPU_Usage", "Memory_Consumption")
        "metric_value": float # Value of the metric
    }
    ```

2.  **Distributed Input:** Events arrive in a non-deterministic order from multiple worker nodes. You will simulate this with a generator function that yields events. Your solution **must** be designed to handle events arriving concurrently from different threads or processes representing different worker nodes.

3.  **Time Windows:** The system needs to compute the k-th smallest value within a sliding time window of size `W` seconds. This means that for each metric, only events with timestamps within the range `[current_time - W, current_time]` are considered for aggregation. The 'current_time' is defined as the timestamp of the latest event received.

4.  **K-th Smallest Value:** For each metric within the time window, compute the k-th smallest `metric_value`. If there are fewer than `k` events for a given metric within the window, return `-1` for that metric.

5.  **Scalability and Efficiency:** The system should be able to handle a large number of worker nodes, a high event rate, and a large number of distinct metrics.  Minimize latency in processing events and computing the k-th smallest value. Consider appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient aggregation and retrieval.  Avoid recomputing aggregations from scratch for each new event.

6.  **Concurrency:** Your implementation **must** be thread-safe (or process-safe, depending on your chosen concurrency model). Multiple threads/processes will be feeding events into your aggregation system concurrently.

7.  **Memory Constraints:**  While you are not given a precise memory limit, be mindful of memory usage. Avoid storing all events indefinitely.  Design your data structures to efficiently manage memory within the time window.

8.  **API:** You need to implement the following methods:

    *   `__init__(self, k: int, window_size: int)`: Initializes the aggregation system with the desired `k` and `window_size`.

    *   `process_event(self, event: dict)`: Processes a single event, updating the aggregation state.

    *   `get_kth_smallest(self, metric_name: str) -> float`: Returns the k-th smallest value for the given `metric_name` within the current time window. Returns `-1` if there are fewer than `k` values for that metric.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   `1 <= window_size <= 600` (seconds)
*   Timestamps are non-decreasing, but not necessarily strictly increasing. Multiple events can have the same timestamp.
*   The number of worker nodes can be large (e.g., thousands).
*   The number of distinct metrics can be large (e.g., hundreds).
*   Metric values are floating-point numbers.
*   Your solution should be optimized for read operations (i.e. `get_kth_smallest` calls) and minimize the latency of read operation.

**Example:**

```python
# Assume events are generated and fed into the system
aggregator = DistributedAggregator(k=3, window_size=60)

aggregator.process_event({"timestamp": 1678886400, "worker_id": "worker1", "metric_name": "CPU_Usage", "metric_value": 25.5})
aggregator.process_event({"timestamp": 1678886410, "worker_id": "worker2", "metric_name": "CPU_Usage", "metric_value": 30.2})
aggregator.process_event({"timestamp": 1678886420, "worker_id": "worker1", "metric_name": "CPU_Usage", "metric_value": 28.1})
aggregator.process_event({"timestamp": 1678886430, "worker_id": "worker3", "metric_name": "CPU_Usage", "metric_value": 32.8})
aggregator.process_event({"timestamp": 1678886440, "worker_id": "worker2", "metric_name": "CPU_Usage", "metric_value": 27.9})

kth_smallest = aggregator.get_kth_smallest("CPU_Usage") # Should return 30.2

aggregator.process_event({"timestamp": 1678886450, "worker_id": "worker4", "metric_name": "CPU_Usage", "metric_value": 26.7})
kth_smallest = aggregator.get_kth_smallest("CPU_Usage") # should return 28.1
```

This problem requires a combination of data structure knowledge (priority queues, heaps), concurrency management (locks, thread-safe data structures), and algorithmic thinking (efficiently maintaining the k-th smallest value within a sliding window). Good luck!

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses a combination of data structures to efficiently maintain and query the k-th smallest value within a sliding time window:

1. A dictionary of events for each metric, sorted by timestamp
2. A dictionary of sorted values for each metric for efficient k-th smallest calculation
3. Thread-safe operations using locks to handle concurrent event processing

The solution efficiently handles:
- Events arriving in non-deterministic order
- Sliding time window
- Thread-safety for concurrent processing
- Memory management by removing expired events

## Time and Space Complexity

- `process_event`: O(log n) time complexity where n is the number of events for a given metric
- `get_kth_smallest`: O(n) in worst case for cleanup + O(1) for retrieval
- Space complexity: O(N) where N is the total number of events across all metrics within the window

## Dependencies

The implementation uses only standard Python libraries:
- `heapq` for priority queue operations
- `threading` for concurrency control
- `collections` for defaultdict and deque
- `bisect` for binary search and insertion

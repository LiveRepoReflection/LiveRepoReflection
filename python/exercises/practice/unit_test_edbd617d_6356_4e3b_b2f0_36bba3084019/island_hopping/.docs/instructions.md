Okay, here's a challenging problem description for a high-level programming competition:

## Question: Optimal Multi-Source Island Hopping

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a scattered archipelago of islands. Each island is a node in a graph, and the cost to travel between two islands is represented by the weight of the edge connecting them.  There is no direct route between every pair of islands; some are simply too far apart to reasonably travel between directly.

You are given:

*   `n`: The number of islands, numbered from 0 to `n-1`.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)` representing a bidirectional edge between island `u` and island `v` with a travel cost of `w`. `0 <= u, v < n`, `w > 0`.
*   `sources`: A list of starting islands. You can start your journey from any of these islands.
*   `targets`: A list of target islands.
*   `k`: An integer representing the maximum number of islands you can visit *in total* during your journey, including the starting and target islands.

Your goal is to find the *minimum total travel cost* to visit *at least one* of the islands within the `targets` list, starting from *any* of the islands within the `sources` list.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

1.  **Multiple Sources & Targets:** You can start at *any* island in the `sources` list and aim to reach *any* island in the `targets` list.

2.  **Limited Visits:** The total number of islands visited during your journey cannot exceed `k`.

3.  **Minimum Cost:** Your solution must find the absolute minimum travel cost across all possible valid paths. If it is not possible to reach any target island within `k` visits, return -1.

4.  **Cycle Detection:** Be mindful of cycles in the graph. Naive traversal algorithms might get stuck in infinite loops.

5.  **Optimization:** Due to the potential size of the graph (up to 10^5 nodes and edges), your solution must be highly optimized for both time and space complexity.  Solutions with exponential complexity will likely time out.  Consider using efficient graph algorithms and data structures.

6.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where:

    *   `sources` or `targets` lists are empty.
    *   No path exists between any source and target within the `k` visit limit.
    *   An island is present in both `sources` and `targets`.

7.  **Large Inputs:** The problem should be solvable for large graphs (e.g., `n` up to 10^5, number of edges up to 10^5, `k` up to `n`).

8.  **Floating Point Precision:** All travel costs (`w` in the `edges` list) are integers. Therefore, your solution only needs to deal with integer values and avoid potential floating-point precision issues.

**Input Format:**

Your function will receive the following arguments:

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of islands.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)` representing the graph's edges.
*   `sources`: A list of integers representing the starting islands.
*   `targets`: A list of integers representing the target islands.
*   `k`: An integer representing the maximum number of islands that can be visited.

**Output Format:**

Your function should return an integer representing the minimum total travel cost to reach any target island from any source island within the `k` visit limit. If no such path exists, return -1.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 1), (2, 4, 7), (3, 4, 3)]
sources = [0, 1]
targets = [3, 4]
k = 4

# Possible paths:
# 0 -> 1 -> 3 (cost: 10 + 1 = 11, visits: 3 <= 4)
# 0 -> 2 -> 4 (cost: 5 + 7 = 12, visits: 3 <= 4)
# 1 -> 3 (cost: 1, visits: 2 <= 4)
# 1 -> 2 -> 4 (cost: 2 + 7 = 9, visits: 3 <= 4)

# Minimum cost: 1

# Output: 1

```

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases. Good luck!

## The Quantum Circuit Optimizer

**Question Description:**

You are developing a quantum computing compiler. One of the critical optimization steps is to minimize the number of "CNOT" gates (a fundamental two-qubit gate) in a quantum circuit, as CNOT gates are often the most error-prone operations.

You are given a quantum circuit represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node in the graph represents a quantum gate, and each edge represents a dependency: gate `A` must be executed before gate `B` if there's a directed edge from `A` to `B`. Each gate operates on a specific set of qubits.

Your task is to reorder the gates in the circuit (without violating dependencies) to minimize the number of CNOT gates that *cross* each other in time. Two CNOT gates *cross* if they operate on overlapping sets of qubits and one is executed before the other in the reordered circuit. The crossing of two CNOT gates is defined by if the two CNOT gates use one or more same qubits at the same time.

More formally:

*   **Input:** A DAG representing the quantum circuit. Each node (gate) in the DAG has the following attributes:

    *   `id`: A unique identifier for the gate (string).
    *   `type`: The type of the gate (string).  Can be "CNOT" or "SingleQubit".
    *   `qubits`: A set of integers representing the qubits the gate operates on (set of integers).

*   **Dependencies:** The DAG structure represents the dependencies between gates. If there's an edge from gate `A` to gate `B`, `A` must be executed before `B`.

*   **Output:** A topological ordering (list of gate IDs) of the gates that minimizes the number of CNOT gate crossings.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Valid Topological Ordering:** The returned ordering must be a valid topological ordering of the input DAG. This means all dependencies must be respected.
2.  **Minimize CNOT Crossings:** Your algorithm must attempt to minimize the number of CNOT gate crossings. Note that finding the absolute minimum is likely NP-hard, so a good heuristic is acceptable.
3.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be reasonably efficient. The number of gates in the circuit can be up to 1000. Be mindful of time complexity.  Solutions with exponential time complexity in the number of gates will not be accepted.
4.  **Tie-breaking:** If multiple topological orderings result in the same number of CNOT crossings, any of them is acceptable.
5.  **Single Qubit Gates:** SingleQubit gates do not contribute to crossing count regardless of their qubit number. Only CNOT gates create crossing.
6.  **Input Format:** The input DAG will be provided in a standard graph format (e.g., a list of nodes with adjacency lists). You'll need to parse this format. A specific example format will be provided later.
7.  **Qubit Range:**  The qubits are numbered from 0 up to a maximum number determined by the input circuit.

**Scoring:**

Solutions will be scored based on the number of CNOT crossings in the generated ordering, compared to a baseline ordering. Lower CNOT crossings will result in a higher score. Solutions that fail to produce a valid topological ordering will receive a score of 0.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a complex quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers. The initial circuit might have many CNOT gates scattered throughout, leading to high error rates. Your optimizer aims to rearrange these gates, pushing potentially conflicting CNOTs further apart in the execution timeline, thus reducing the overall error probability. This optimization is critical for making quantum algorithms practical on near-term quantum hardware.

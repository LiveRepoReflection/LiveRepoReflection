Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging and require a sophisticated solution:

### Question Description

A critical infrastructure network (e.g., power grid, water supply, transportation) can be modeled as a weighted, directed graph. Nodes represent key infrastructure components (power stations, water reservoirs, transportation hubs), and edges represent connections between them (power lines, water pipes, roads). Each node has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of resource it can process or store. Each edge has a capacity and a cost, representing the maximum flow it can handle and the cost per unit of resource flowing through it, respectively.

You are given a network represented as a list of nodes and a list of edges. Each node has a unique ID, a capacity, and a resource demand (positive for supply, negative for demand). Each edge connects two nodes (source and destination), has a capacity, and a cost per unit of flow.

Due to budget constraints, you have a limited amount of resources to allocate across the network to satisfy the demands of each node. Your task is to determine the optimal flow allocation across the network that minimizes the total cost while satisfying all resource demands and respecting node and edge capacities.

**Specifically, you need to:**

1.  **Determine Feasibility:** Determine if it's even possible to satisfy all demands given the network topology, capacities, and available resources. If it's not feasible, return `None`.

2.  **Optimize Flow Allocation:** If feasible, find the flow allocation for each edge that minimizes the total cost. The flow on each edge must respect the edge's capacity, and the total flow into and out of each node must respect the node's demand and capacity.

**Input:**

*   `nodes`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a node and has the following keys:
    *   `id`: (int) Unique identifier for the node.
    *   `capacity`: (int) Maximum resource capacity of the node.
    *   `demand`: (int) Resource demand of the node (positive for supply, negative for demand).
*   `edges`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an edge and has the following keys:
    *   `source`: (int) ID of the source node.
    *   `destination`: (int) ID of the destination node.
    *   `capacity`: (int) Maximum flow capacity of the edge.
    *   `cost`: (float) Cost per unit of flow on the edge.
*   `total_resources`: (int) The total resources available for allocation.

**Output:**

*   If no feasible solution exists, return `None`.
*   If a feasible solution exists, return a dictionary representing the optimal flow allocation. The keys of the dictionary are tuples `(source_node_id, destination_node_id)` representing the edges, and the values are the optimal flow assigned to that edge (float).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes can be up to 500.
*   The number of edges can be up to 2000.
*   Node capacities and demands can be large (up to 10^6).
*   Edge capacities can be large (up to 10^6).
*   Edge costs can be floating-point numbers.
*   The total resources available can be large (up to 10^9).
*   The solution must be computationally efficient. Inefficient solutions will time out.
*   The flow on each edge must be a non-negative number.
*   The flow into a node cannot exceed its capacity.
*   The absolute value of the difference between total supply and total demand must be less than or equal to the total available resources.

**Example:**

```python
nodes = [
    {'id': 1, 'capacity': 100, 'demand': 50},  # Supply node
    {'id': 2, 'capacity': 100, 'demand': -30}, # Demand node
    {'id': 3, 'capacity': 100, 'demand': -20}  # Demand node
]
edges = [
    {'source': 1, 'destination': 2, 'capacity': 40, 'cost': 1.0},
    {'source': 1, 'destination': 3, 'capacity': 60, 'cost': 2.0}
]
total_resources = 100
```

A possible (and likely optimal) solution would be:

```python
{
    (1, 2): 30.0,
    (1, 3): 20.0
}
```

**Note:** This problem requires knowledge of network flow algorithms and optimization techniques. Efficient implementations are crucial to pass the time limit. Solutions using linear programming solvers might be appropriate. Consider the potential for cycles in the graph and ensure your algorithm handles them correctly. Small numerical errors in the floating point calculation are expected.

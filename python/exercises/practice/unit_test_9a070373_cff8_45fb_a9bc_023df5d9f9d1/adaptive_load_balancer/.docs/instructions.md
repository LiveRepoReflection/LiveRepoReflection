## Question: Distributed Load Balancing with Adaptive Routing

**Scenario:**

You are building a distributed system for processing a large volume of incoming requests. The system consists of `N` worker nodes, each with varying processing capacities and network latencies to different data sources.  The goal is to design a load balancer that efficiently distributes incoming requests to these worker nodes, minimizing overall processing time.

**Input:**

1.  `N`: The number of worker nodes (1 <= N <= 1000).
2.  `requests`: A list of incoming requests. Each request is a string. The length of the `requests` list can be very large (up to 10^6).
3.  `capacities`: A list of `N` integers, where `capacities[i]` represents the processing capacity of the i-th worker node. Higher values indicate greater capacity. (1 <= `capacities[i]` <= 1000).
4.  `latencies`: A 2D list of `N x M` integers, where `latencies[i][j]` represents the network latency between the i-th worker node and the j-th data source. Each request requires accessing one data source. `M` is the number of data sources. (0 <= `latencies[i][j]` <= 100).  Assume `M` is at most 10. The request includes the index of the data source needed (`0 <= data_source_index < M`).
5.  `request_data_sources`: A list of integers, where `request_data_sources[k]` specifies the data source index required by the k-th request in the `requests` list.

**Output:**

A list of `N` lists, where the i-th list contains the requests assigned to the i-th worker node. The order of requests within each worker's list should match the order they appeared in the original `requests` list.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Adaptive Routing:** The load balancer must dynamically adjust its routing strategy based on the current workload of each worker node and the network latencies to the required data sources.
2.  **Capacity Awareness:**  The load balancer must respect the processing capacities of each worker node. Assigning too many requests to a low-capacity worker will result in poor performance.
3.  **Latency Minimization:** The load balancer should strive to minimize the total network latency for all requests.  This means considering the data source location for each request and assigning it to a worker with low latency to that data source.
4.  **Fairness (Optional but encouraged):** While optimizing for overall performance, try to distribute the load reasonably fairly among the worker nodes, avoiding extreme imbalances.
5.  **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient enough to handle a large number of requests (up to 10^6) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few minutes).
6.  **Request Format**: Request are string, and all workers node can handle any request, regardless of what the request is.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

1.  **Throughput:** The total number of requests processed per unit of time (implicitly measured by the execution time of your solution).
2.  **Total Latency:** The sum of network latencies for all requests, reflecting the efficiency of data source access.
3.  **Capacity Utilization:** How effectively the processing capacities of the worker nodes are utilized. Ideally, all workers should be close to their maximum capacity without being overloaded.
4.  **Fairness (Secondary):** The distribution of requests among workers. A more balanced distribution will be favored.
5.  **Correctness:** The output must be a valid assignment of requests to workers, satisfying the output format requirements.

**Hints:**

1.  Consider using a priority queue (heap) to track worker node availability and prioritize assignments.
2.  Explore different load balancing strategies, such as weighted round-robin, least connections, or a custom algorithm tailored to this specific scenario.
3.  Think about how to dynamically adjust the weights or priorities based on real-time feedback from the worker nodes (although true real-time feedback is not part of this problem).
4.  Pre-computing some data or using appropriate data structures can significantly improve performance.
5.  Be mindful of the time complexity of your solution. Aim for an algorithm that scales well with the number of requests and worker nodes.

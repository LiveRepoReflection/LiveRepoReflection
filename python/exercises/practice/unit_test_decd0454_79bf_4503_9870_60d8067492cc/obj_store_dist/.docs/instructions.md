## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a simplified distributed object store.  This system will store and retrieve large binary objects (blobs) across a cluster of storage nodes.  Due to network limitations and potential node failures, data consistency and availability are critical concerns.

**System Architecture:**

The object store consists of a cluster of `N` storage nodes (where `N` can be quite large, on the order of hundreds or thousands).  Each object is identified by a unique string key.  The system must support two primary operations:

*   `put(key: str, data: bytes)`: Stores the given byte data associated with the key.
*   `get(key: str) -> bytes`: Retrieves the byte data associated with the key.  If the key does not exist, return `None`.

**Data Replication and Consistency:**

To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, each object should be replicated across multiple storage nodes.  Implement *eventual consistency* using a vector clock-based approach to handle concurrent updates. Each object will have the following associated metadata:

*   `data: bytes`: The actual object data.
*   `vector_clock: List[int]`: A list of `N` integers, where `N` is the number of storage nodes. The *i*-th element of the vector clock represents the number of updates seen by the *i*-th node for that object.

When a client performs a `put` operation, the following steps should be performed:

1.  **Hashing and Node Selection:** The key is hashed to determine a set of `K` (configurable) storage nodes where the object will be stored.  Use consistent hashing to distribute keys uniformly and minimize data movement during node additions or removals.
2.  **Write to Nodes:** The client sends the `put` request, including the data and the object's metadata (if it exists), to each of the selected `K` nodes.
3.  **Node Processing:**
    *   If the node doesn't have the object yet, it stores the data and initializes a vector clock with all zeros, then increments its corresponding vector clock entry.
    *   If the node already has the object, it compares the incoming vector clock with its local vector clock.
        *   If the incoming vector clock is *concurrent* (i.e., neither clock dominates the other), the node must store both versions of the data as siblings, along with their corresponding vector clocks.
        *   If the incoming vector clock *dominates* the local vector clock, the node replaces the local data and vector clock with the incoming ones.
        *   If the local vector clock *dominates* the incoming vector clock, the node discards the incoming data and sends its current data and vector clock to the client.
4. **Client Handling:**
    * If a node sends back its local data and vector clock (because the local clock dominated), the client retries the `put` operation with the updated data from that node.
    * Otherwise, the client considers the `put` to be successful after hearing from all `K` nodes.

When a client performs a `get` operation, the following steps should be performed:

1.  **Hashing and Node Selection:** Same as in `put`.
2.  **Read from Nodes:** The client sends the `get` request to each of the selected `K` nodes.
3.  **Node Processing:** Each node returns the object's data and vector clock, or `None` if the object does not exist on that node.
4.  **Client Handling:** The client collects the responses from all `K` nodes.
    *   If all nodes return `None`, the `get` operation returns `None`.
    *   If multiple versions (siblings) of the object are returned (different data but the same key), the client must resolve the conflict.  Implement a *last-write-wins* strategy based on the vector clocks.  The version with the highest vector clock value (determined by comparing the vector clocks element by element) is returned.  If the vector clocks are identical (highly unlikely), return any version.
    *   If only one version is returned, return the data.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of objects and storage nodes.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should remain available even if some storage nodes fail.
*   **Data Size:** Objects can be quite large (up to 1GB).  Consider the impact of large object transfers on network bandwidth.
*   **Concurrency:** The system should handle concurrent `put` operations from multiple clients.
*   **Vector Clock Size:** The vector clock size should be equal to the number of storage nodes `N`.
*   **Number of Nodes:** `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   **Replication Factor:** `1 <= K <= N`
*   **Key Length:** `1 <= len(key) <= 256`
*   **Data Length:** `0 <= len(data) <= 1024 * 1024 * 1024`

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  Implement the `put(key: str, data: bytes)` and `get(key: str) -> bytes` methods.
2.  Implement a consistent hashing function to map keys to storage nodes.  Consider using a library or implementing your own.
3.  Implement the vector clock comparison logic to determine dominance and concurrency.
4.  Implement the conflict resolution strategy for `get` operations.
5.  Implement basic node failure handling (e.g., retries).
6.  Optimize for read performance when no conflicts are present.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement node addition and removal with minimal data movement.
*   Implement background processes to reconcile divergent object versions.
*   Implement a mechanism to detect and repair corrupted data.
*   Implement a mechanism to garbage collect old versions of objects.
*   Implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution strategy (e.g., using application-specific logic).
*   Implement a more robust node failure handling mechanism (e.g., using a consensus algorithm).

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures (dictionaries, lists), hashing algorithms, concurrency control, and network communication. It also involves trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance. Good luck!

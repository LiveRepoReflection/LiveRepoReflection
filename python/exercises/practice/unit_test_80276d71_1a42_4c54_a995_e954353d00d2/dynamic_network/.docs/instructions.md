## Question: Multi-Source Shortest Path with Dynamic Edge Weights

### Problem Description

You are designing a critical infrastructure network consisting of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`, representing key facilities (e.g., power stations, water treatment plants, communication hubs). The network is represented as an undirected graph with `M` edges. Each edge connects two nodes and has an associated base cost.

However, the cost (or weight) of traversing an edge isn't static. It dynamically changes based on the "load" on the network. The network load is calculated at each node.

Specifically, the weight of an edge `(u, v)` at any given time is calculated as:

`weight(u, v) = base_cost(u, v) + α * (load(u) + load(v))`

where:

*   `base_cost(u, v)` is the fixed base cost associated with the edge `(u, v)`.
*   `α` is a system-wide sensitivity factor.
*   `load(u)` is the current load at node `u`.

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `M`: The number of edges in the network.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, base_cost)` represents an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v` with a base cost of `base_cost`.
*   `α`: The system-wide sensitivity factor.
*   `sources`: A list of source nodes from which you need to find the shortest paths to all other nodes.
*   `queries`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(node, load_updates)` represents a query. For each query, you need to calculate the shortest distance from any of the `source` nodes to the given `node` *after* applying the given `load_updates`. `load_updates` is a dictionary mapping node indices to load increments.

**Task:**

Write a function `shortest_distances(N, edges, α, sources, queries)` that takes the network description, sensitivity factor, source nodes, and a list of queries as input. For each query `(node, load_updates)`, your function should:

1.  Apply the `load_updates` to the current network load.  The load at a node will never be negative.
2.  Calculate the shortest distance from any of the `sources` to the specified `node`, considering the dynamic edge weights.
3.  Return a list of the calculated shortest distances, corresponding to the order of the input `queries`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= M <= min(2 * 10^5, N * (N - 1) / 2)`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `1 <= base_cost <= 10^3`
*   `0 <= α <= 10^2`
*   `1 <= len(sources) <= N`
*   `1 <= len(queries) <= 10^3`
*   `0 <= load_increment <= 10^3`

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider the time complexity of your chosen algorithm and data structures.  Recomputing the entire shortest path from scratch for each query may not be efficient enough.
*   Pay close attention to memory usage, especially with potentially large graphs.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph may not be fully connected.  If a node is unreachable from any of the sources, the shortest distance should be returned as `-1`.
*   A node can appear multiple times in `load_updates` within a single query.

**Example:**

```python
N = 4
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (1, 2, 15), (0, 2, 20), (2, 3, 25)]
alpha = 2
sources = [0, 3]
queries = [
    (2, {0: 5}),  # Node 2, load at node 0 increases by 5
    (1, {1: 3, 2: 2}), # Node 1, load at node 1 increases by 3, load at node 2 increases by 2
    (3, {3: 10})  # Node 3, load at node 3 increases by 10
]

# Expected output (approximate values):
# [50, 46, 0]
# Explanation:
# 1. For the first query (node 2, {0: 5}):
#    load(0) = 5, load(1) = 0, load(2) = 0, load(3) = 0
#    weight(0, 1) = 10 + 2*(5 + 0) = 20
#    weight(1, 2) = 15 + 2*(0 + 0) = 15
#    weight(0, 2) = 20 + 2*(5 + 0) = 30
#    weight(2, 3) = 25 + 2*(0 + 0) = 25

#    Shortest path from 0 to 2 is 30 (0 -> 2)
#    Shortest path from 3 to 2 is 25 (3 -> 2)
#    Shortest distance to 2 is min(30, 25) = 25
#2.  For the second query (node 1, {1: 3, 2: 2}):
#    load(0) = 5, load(1) = 3, load(2) = 2, load(3) = 0
#    weight(0, 1) = 10 + 2*(5 + 3) = 26
#    weight(1, 2) = 15 + 2*(3 + 2) = 25
#    weight(0, 2) = 20 + 2*(5 + 2) = 34
#    weight(2, 3) = 25 + 2*(2 + 0) = 29
#    Shortest path from 0 to 1 is 26 (0 -> 1)
#    Shortest path from 3 to 1 is -1 (unreachable)
#    Shortest distance to 1 is min(26, -1) = 26

#3.  For the third query (node 3, {3: 10}):
#    load(0) = 5, load(1) = 3, load(2) = 2, load(3) = 10
#    weight(0, 1) = 10 + 2*(5 + 3) = 26
#    weight(1, 2) = 15 + 2*(3 + 2) = 25
#    weight(0, 2) = 20 + 2*(5 + 2) = 34
#    weight(2, 3) = 25 + 2*(2 + 10) = 49
#    Shortest path from 0 to 3 is 34 + 49 = 83
#    Shortest path from 3 to 3 is 0
#    Shortest distance to 3 is min(83, 0) = 0
```

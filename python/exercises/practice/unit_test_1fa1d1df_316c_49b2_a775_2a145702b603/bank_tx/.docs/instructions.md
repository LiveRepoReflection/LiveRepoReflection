Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Python coding problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for a simplified banking system.  This system involves multiple independent bank servers (nodes), each managing a subset of user accounts.  To maintain data consistency, transactions that involve accounts across multiple bank servers must be atomic (all or nothing).

**The System:**

*   **Bank Servers (Nodes):** Represented by integers from `0` to `N-1`. Each bank server maintains a dictionary mapping user IDs (integers) to account balances (integers). Each server only knows the accounts it manages locally.
*   **Transactions:** Represented as a list of operations. Each operation is a tuple `(server_id, user_id, amount)`.

    *   `server_id`: The ID of the bank server involved in the operation.
    *   `user_id`: The ID of the user account affected.
    *   `amount`: The amount to be transferred. A positive amount represents a deposit; a negative amount represents a withdrawal.

*   **Transaction Coordinator:** Your code will act as the transaction coordinator, orchestrating the transaction across the involved bank servers.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `coordinate_transaction(bank_servers, transaction)` that attempts to execute the given transaction across the provided bank servers.

**Input:**

*   `bank_servers`: A list of dictionaries, where `bank_servers[i]` represents the account data of bank server `i`. The keys of each dictionary are user IDs, and the values are account balances. Assume that each server_id in transaction will be a valid index in bank_servers.
*   `transaction`: A list of transaction operations, as described above.

**Output:**

*   Return `True` if the transaction can be successfully committed (all operations are applied).
*   Return `False` if the transaction must be rolled back (at least one operation fails).  If the transaction fails, all changes made to account balances during the transaction **must** be reverted back to their original state *before* the function returns.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

1.  **Atomicity:** The transaction must be atomic. Either all operations succeed, or none do.
2.  **Isolation:** While a transaction is in progress, the account balances should be considered "locked" to prevent conflicting transactions. However, for the sake of this problem, you don't need to implement actual locking. Consider it an implicit constraint.
3.  **Durability:** Although the operations are performed in memory, assume any committed transaction is durable. We won't test crash recovery here.
4.  **Insufficient Funds:** A transaction must fail if any withdrawal operation would result in a negative account balance on any server.
5.  **Invalid Accounts:** If a user_id in the transaction does not exist on the specified bank server, the transaction must fail.
6.  **Concurrency:** You do not need to handle concurrent transactions.
7.  **Large transactions:** The transaction list can potentially be very long (e.g., 10000 operations). The solution must be efficient in processing large transactions.
8.  **Negative initial balances:** User accounts may start with negative balances.
9.  **Zero amount transfers:** Transactions with `amount=0` are valid and should not cause errors.
10. **Error Handling:** Your code should not raise exceptions unless absolutely necessary (e.g., invalid input format). Prefer returning `False` to indicate failure.
11. **Server Count:** The number of bank servers can be large. Design your solution so that it can handle many bank servers efficiently.
12. **Memory Usage:** Be conscious of memory usage, especially when handling large transactions. Avoid creating unnecessary copies of data.
13. **Performance:** Try to avoid unnecessary iterations and redundant calculations, especially within the transaction processing loop. Optimizations are encouraged.

**Example:**

```python
bank_servers = [
    {101: 100, 102: 50},  # Server 0
    {201: 200, 202: 75}   # Server 1
]

transaction = [
    (0, 101, -20),  # Server 0, user 101, withdraw 20
    (1, 201, 20)   # Server 1, user 201, deposit 20
]

result = coordinate_transaction(bank_servers, transaction)  # Should return True

# After the transaction:
# bank_servers = [
#     {101: 80, 102: 50},
#     {201: 220, 202: 75}
# ]

bank_servers = [
    {101: 100, 102: 50},  # Server 0
    {201: 200, 202: 75}   # Server 1
]

transaction = [
    (0, 101, -150),  # Server 0, user 101, withdraw 150 (insufficient funds)
    (1, 201, 20)   # Server 1, user 201, deposit 20
]

result = coordinate_transaction(bank_servers, transaction)  # Should return False

# After the transaction (rolled back):
# bank_servers = [
#     {101: 100, 102: 50},
#     {201: 200, 202: 75}
# ]
```

This problem requires careful consideration of error handling, data consistency, and efficient algorithm design. Good luck!

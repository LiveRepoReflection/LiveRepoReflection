## Question: Optimal Train Network Design

**Problem Description:**

A country is planning a new high-speed rail network to connect its major cities. You are tasked with designing the optimal network to minimize construction costs while satisfying specific connectivity requirements and capacity constraints.

The country is represented as a graph where:

*   Nodes represent cities. Each city has a population and a geographical location (x, y coordinates).
*   Edges represent potential rail lines between cities. Each potential rail line has a construction cost associated with it, proportional to the distance between the cities.

**Connectivity Requirements:**

1.  **Minimum Spanning Tree:** All cities must be connected, forming at least one connected component.

2.  **Critical Cities:**  A subset of cities are designated as "critical cities." These cities must have a higher level of connectivity. Specifically, for each critical city, there must be *at least two* independent paths to every other city in the network. Two paths are considered independent if they share no edges.

**Capacity Constraints:**

1.  **Edge Capacity:** Each rail line (edge) has a maximum capacity representing the number of passengers it can handle per day. The capacity is related to the construction cost, but also influenced by terrain.

2.  **City Demand:** Each city has a demand, which is proportional to its population.

3.  **Flow Requirement:** For every pair of cities (A, B), the network must support a minimum flow equal to the *minimum* of the demands of the two cities (A and B). The flow represents the number of passengers traveling between the two cities.

**Optimization Goal:**

Minimize the total construction cost of the rail network while adhering to all connectivity requirements and capacity constraints.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following:

*   `N`: The number of cities.
*   `cities`: A list of `N` tuples, where each tuple contains: `(city_id, population, x_coordinate, y_coordinate, is_critical)`.  `city_id` is a unique integer identifier. `is_critical` is a boolean.

*   `potential_edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains: `(city_id_1, city_id_2, base_cost, terrain_factor)`. `city_id_1` and `city_id_2` are the IDs of the cities connected by the potential edge. `base_cost` is the cost proportional to distance. `terrain_factor` is a multiplier on the `base_cost`, representing the difficulty of building in that terrain (e.g., mountains, rivers). The actual cost of the edge is `base_cost * terrain_factor`.

* `capacity_factors`: A dictionary where the key is a tuple of `(city_id_1, city_id_2)` representing a potential edge and the value is a float factor. The final edge capacity is equal to `base_capacity * capacity_factors[(city_id_1, city_id_2)]`, where `base_capacity = 1000`.

**Output:**

Return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a selected rail line (edge) in the final network: `(city_id_1, city_id_2)`.  The order of `city_id_1` and `city_id_2` within the tuple does not matter (i.e., (1, 2) is equivalent to (2, 1)).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= population <= 1000000`
*   `0 <= x_coordinate, y_coordinate <= 1000`
*   `1 <= base_cost <= 100`
*   `1 <= terrain_factor <= 10`
*   Edge capacities must be integers.
*   The solution must be computationally feasible within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few minutes).

**Scoring:**

The score is based on the total construction cost of the selected rail lines. Lower cost solutions receive higher scores. Solutions that do not meet the connectivity and capacity constraints will receive a score of 0.

**Challenge:**

This problem combines elements of graph theory, network flow, and optimization. Finding the optimal solution requires a sophisticated approach that balances cost, connectivity, and capacity. Due to the complexity and interdependencies of the constraints, a brute-force approach will not be feasible. You'll need to be strategic in selecting edges to ensure both connectivity and sufficient flow while minimizing cost. Consider using a combination of algorithms and heuristics to find a near-optimal solution.

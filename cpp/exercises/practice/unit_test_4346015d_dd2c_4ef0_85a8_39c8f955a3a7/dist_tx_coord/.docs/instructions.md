## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for a highly concurrent, eventually consistent distributed database. This database spans multiple independent nodes, and transactions can involve operations on data residing on different nodes. The goal is to provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, or at least strive for them as much as possible in a distributed environment, while maintaining high availability and performance.

The system needs to handle a large number of concurrent transactions, with each transaction potentially involving multiple operations (read/write) on different data items across different nodes. Due to the inherent limitations of distributed systems (network latency, node failures), a fully synchronous, strongly consistent approach is not feasible. You need to design a coordinator that can handle partial failures and ensure that transactions either fully commit or fully rollback across all involved nodes, even in the face of failures.

**Input:**

The coordinator receives transaction requests from clients. Each transaction request contains:

*   A unique transaction ID (UUID).
*   A list of operations. Each operation specifies:
    *   The node ID where the operation needs to be performed.
    *   The type of operation (READ or WRITE).
    *   The data item to be read or written (identified by a key).
    *   The value to be written (if the operation is a WRITE).

**Output:**

For each transaction request, the coordinator should return a result:

*   `COMMIT(transaction_id)`: Indicates that the transaction was successfully committed on all involved nodes.
*   `ROLLBACK(transaction_id)`: Indicates that the transaction was rolled back on all involved nodes due to some failure or conflict.
*   `TIMEOUT(transaction_id)`: Indicates that the coordinator could not determine the final state of the transaction within a reasonable time frame (due to node failures or network issues).

**Constraints:**

1.  **Scalability:** The coordinator must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent transactions (e.g., 10,000+ transactions per second).
2.  **Fault Tolerance:** The coordinator should be resilient to node failures and network partitions. It should be able to recover from failures and continue processing transactions.
3.  **Eventual Consistency:** The system does not need to be strongly consistent. It's acceptable to have a short period of inconsistency after a transaction commits, as long as the system eventually converges to a consistent state.
4.  **Transaction Isolation:** Implement a suitable isolation level (e.g., snapshot isolation, read committed) to minimize conflicts between concurrent transactions. You must clearly explain which level is achieved and what potential anomalies could occur.
5.  **Optimization:** Minimize network communication and latency. Focus on optimizing the critical path for transaction processing.
6.  **Node Unavailability:** Nodes might be temporarily unavailable. The coordinator should handle node unavailability gracefully and attempt to complete the transaction when the nodes become available again, potentially within a bounded time.
7.  **Idempotency:** The operations on each node must be idempotent, meaning that applying the same operation multiple times has the same effect as applying it once.
8.  **Time Limit:** Each transaction has a maximum time limit to complete (e.g., 5 seconds). If the transaction cannot be committed or rolled back within this time, it should be marked as `TIMEOUT`.
9.  **Memory Limit:** The coordinator has a limited amount of memory. Avoid storing large amounts of data in memory.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The solution must correctly commit or rollback transactions according to the ACID properties (as much as possible in an eventually consistent system).
*   **Performance:** The solution must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent transactions with low latency.
*   **Scalability:** The solution must be able to scale to handle a large number of nodes and transactions.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The solution must be resilient to node failures and network partitions.
*   **Code Quality:** The code must be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.

**Possible Approaches:**

Consider exploring distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Raft, Paxos), two-phase commit (2PC) with optimizations for eventual consistency, or alternatives like optimistic concurrency control with conflict resolution. Carefully consider the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance when choosing your approach.

**Note:** This is a design and implementation problem. You are expected to design the architecture of the coordinator, implement the core logic, and demonstrate its correctness and performance. You are not required to implement the actual distributed database nodes. You can simulate the behavior of the nodes using mock objects or stubs.

This problem allows for various solutions with different trade-offs, making it challenging and requiring a deep understanding of distributed systems principles. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready. Here's your coding problem:

**Problem:** Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

**Description:**

You are given a set of `n` tasks to be scheduled on a single processor. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id[i]`: A unique integer identifier for the task.
*   `duration[i]`: The amount of time (in milliseconds) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline[i]`: The time (in milliseconds from the start of the scheduling) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task `id`s that must be completed before task `i` can start.

Your goal is to determine the optimal schedule of these tasks to maximize the total *value* of completed tasks before their deadlines. The *value* of a task is 1 if it is completed by its deadline; otherwise, it is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of tasks `n` can be up to 1000.
*   Task durations can range from 1 to 1000 milliseconds.
*   Deadlines can range from 1 to 1,000,000 milliseconds.
*   Dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  There are no circular dependencies.
*   It is possible that not all tasks can be completed before their deadlines, even with the most optimal schedule.
*   The scheduler starts at time 0.
*   Tasks must be executed sequentially; you cannot run tasks in parallel.
*   Preemption is **not** allowed. Once a task starts, it must run to completion.

**Input:**

The input is provided as follows:

*   `n`: The number of tasks.
*   `id`: An array of integers representing the task IDs.
*   `duration`: An array of integers representing the duration of each task.
*   `deadline`: An array of integers representing the deadline of each task.
*   `dependencies`: A 2D array (or list of lists) where `dependencies[i]` is a list of task `id`s that task `i` depends on.

**Output:**

Return the maximum total value (number of tasks completed before their deadlines) achievable by scheduling the tasks optimally.

**Example:**

```
n = 4
id = [1, 2, 3, 4]
duration = [100, 200, 150, 100]
deadline = [350, 500, 400, 600]
dependencies = [[], [1], [1], [2, 3]]
```

One optimal schedule might be:

1.  Task 1 (duration 100, completes at time 100, deadline 350) - Value = 1
2.  Task 2 (duration 200, completes at time 300, deadline 500) - Value = 1
3.  Task 3 (duration 150, completes at time 450, deadline 400) - Value = 0
4.  Task 4 (duration 100, completes at time 550, deadline 600) - Value = 1

Total value: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3

**Challenge:**

The key challenge lies in finding an efficient algorithm to explore the possible task schedules, considering the dependencies and deadlines, to maximize the total value.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out for larger input sets.  Consider the trade-offs between different scheduling strategies (e.g., earliest deadline first, shortest duration first) and how to incorporate dependencies effectively. You may need to use Dynamic Programming and topological sorting.

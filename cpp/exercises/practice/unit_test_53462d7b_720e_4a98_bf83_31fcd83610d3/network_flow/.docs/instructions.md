Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed to be difficult and require sophisticated techniques, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

**Problem Title: Efficient Network Routing with Dynamic Traffic**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a network routing protocol for a large data center. The data center network consists of `N` servers (nodes) and `M` direct connections (edges) between them.  Each server has a unique ID from `0` to `N-1`.

Initially, each edge has a fixed bandwidth capacity, denoted by `capacity[u][v]` where `u` and `v` are the server IDs connected by the edge. The bandwidth capacity is the maximum amount of data that can flow through that edge per unit of time. The network is undirected, meaning if there's an edge between `u` and `v`, data can flow in either direction.

However, the network experiences dynamic traffic patterns. At any given time, there are `K` active data transfer requests. Each request `i` has a source server `source[i]`, a destination server `destination[i]`, and a required bandwidth `demand[i]`.

Your task is to design an algorithm that efficiently handles these data transfer requests by finding paths through the network and allocating bandwidth. The network must satisfy the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity Constraint:** The total bandwidth allocated to edges between any two servers must not exceed their capacity.
2.  **Flow Conservation:** For each server (except the source and destination for a given request), the total bandwidth entering the server must equal the total bandwidth leaving the server for that request.
3.  **Bandwidth Allocation:** If a request can be fully satisfied (i.e., a path exists with sufficient bandwidth), then all of the `demand[i]` bandwidth must be allocated for that request. If a request cannot be fully satisfied, allocate as much bandwidth as possible (maximize the bandwidth allocated for that request). Note: partial allocation of bandwidth for a single request may require splitting flow across multiple paths.

The system receives queries to add, remove and query the bandwidth allocation for any active request.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of servers (nodes) in the network.  `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `M`: The number of direct connections (edges) in the network. `1 <= M <= 5000`
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, capacity)` represents an edge between server `u` and server `v` with a capacity `capacity`. `0 <= u, v < N`, `1 <= capacity <= 1000`
*   `K`: The number of active data transfer requests.
*   `requests`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(source, destination, demand)` represents a data transfer request from server `source` to server `destination` with a required bandwidth `demand`. `0 <= source, destination < N`, `1 <= demand <= 1000`

Then, the system receives a series of `Q` queries. Each query can be one of the following types:

*   `ADD request_id source destination demand`: Adds a new request with ID `request_id`, `source`, `destination`, and `demand`. `0 <= request_id < Q`, `0 <= source, destination < N`, `1 <= demand <= 1000`. It's guaranteed that `request_id` is unique.
*   `REMOVE request_id`: Removes the request with ID `request_id`.
*   `QUERY request_id`: Queries the amount of bandwidth allocated to the request with ID `request_id`.  If the request is not active, the output should be 0.

`1 <= Q <= 10000`

**Output:**

For each `QUERY` operation, output the bandwidth allocated to the specified request.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient in handling a large number of servers, connections, and dynamic requests. Frequent updates to request allocations should not take too long. Aim for a time complexity that can handle the given constraints.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially with a large number of servers and connections.
*   **Multiple Valid Solutions:** There may be multiple valid ways to allocate bandwidth. Your algorithm needs to find *one* such allocation.
*   **Optimality:** While finding the absolute optimal bandwidth allocation might be computationally expensive, aim for a reasonably good allocation strategy.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where there is no path between the source and destination, or where the network capacity is insufficient to meet the demand.
*   **Floating point arithmetic**: Be careful with the float point accuracy, use integer or fixed point arithmetic to represent bandwidth values.

**Example:**

Let's say N=4, M=4, edges = `[(0, 1, 10), (1, 2, 5), (0, 2, 15), (2, 3, 8)]` and K=1, request = `[(0, 3, 7)]`.
For this small example, one possible solution could allocate 5 bandwidth from the path `0 -> 2 -> 3`, and 2 bandwidth from the path `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the bandwidth allocation.
*   Efficiency of the algorithm in handling a large number of servers, connections, and dynamic requests.
*   Code clarity and readability.

Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging C++ problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and real-world considerations.

### Project Name
`NetworkOptimization`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimized network routing system for a large-scale data center. The data center consists of `N` servers, each identified by a unique integer ID from 0 to N-1.  Servers are interconnected via a network.  The network's topology is dynamic; connections between servers can appear and disappear over time.

The core requirement is to efficiently route data packets between any two servers in the data center.  Each data packet has a source server, a destination server, a size (in bytes), and a deadline (a timestamp representing the latest time the packet must arrive at its destination).

The network has the following characteristics:

*   **Dynamic Topology:** The network topology changes frequently. You will receive updates indicating the addition or removal of links (edges) between servers. Each link has a current bandwidth capacity (in bytes per second) and a latency (in seconds).
*   **Congestion:** Bandwidth on each link is shared among all packets traversing it. When multiple packets are routed through the same link simultaneously, the available bandwidth is divided proportionally among them.  Assume fair queuing.
*   **Packet Splitting:** To improve throughput and meet deadlines, packets can be split into smaller sub-packets. Each sub-packet can be routed independently and reassembled at the destination.  There is a small overhead associated with splitting a packet: for each sub-packet created, an additional `K` bytes of metadata must be transmitted.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be robust to link failures. If a link goes down during transmission, any packets/sub-packets using that link must be rerouted.

Your task is to implement a system that can:

1.  **Handle Network Updates:** Efficiently process updates to the network topology (link additions/removals, bandwidth changes).
2.  **Route Packets:** Given a source server, a destination server, a packet size, and a deadline, determine the optimal route(s) for the packet (potentially split into sub-packets) to meet the deadline while minimizing overall network congestion.  If the deadline cannot be met, the system should return an error.
3.  **Reroute on Failure:**  If a link fails during transmission, identify all packets/sub-packets affected and reroute them using the current network topology.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of servers)
*   `1 <= Packet Size <= 10^9` bytes
*   `1 <= Bandwidth <= 10^9` bytes per second
*   `0 <= Latency <= 10` seconds
*   `0 <= Deadline <= 10^9` seconds (Unix timestamp)
*   `0 <= K <= 100` (Metadata overhead per sub-packet in bytes)
*   The number of network updates and routing requests can be up to 10^5.

**Requirements:**

*   The solution must be implemented in C++.
*   The code must be well-structured, modular, and easy to understand.
*   The solution must be efficient in terms of both time and memory usage.  Consider the impact of each operation on the overall performance, especially given the large number of updates and routing requests.
*   The routing algorithm should consider both bandwidth and latency to find the optimal path.
*   The packet splitting strategy should be adaptive and take into account the overhead `K`.
*   The system should handle edge cases gracefully, such as unreachable destinations or insufficient bandwidth.

**Input Format:**

The system should accept commands via standard input. The commands are as follows:

*   `add_link u v bandwidth latency`: Adds a link between server `u` and server `v` with the specified bandwidth and latency.
*   `remove_link u v`: Removes the link between server `u` and server `v`.
*   `update_bandwidth u v bandwidth`: Updates the bandwidth of the link between server `u` and server `v`.
*   `route source destination size deadline`: Routes a packet from server `source` to server `destination` with the specified size and deadline.
*   `link_failure u v`: Simulates a link failure between server `u` and server `v`.

**Output Format:**

*   For `route` commands:
    *   If the packet can be routed successfully within the deadline, print the total number of sub-packets created and the route taken by each sub-packet. The route should be a space-separated list of server IDs.
    *   If the packet cannot be routed within the deadline, print "ERROR: Deadline cannot be met."
*   For `link_failure` commands: No output required.  The system should internally reroute affected packets.

**Example:**

```
Input:
add_link 0 1 1000 1
add_link 1 2 500 2
route 0 2 1500 10

Output:
2
0 1 2
0 1 2

Input:
add_link 0 1 1000 1
route 0 2 1500 5

Output:
ERROR: Deadline cannot be met.

Input:
add_link 0 1 1000 1
add_link 1 2 500 2
route 0 2 1500 10
link_failure 1 2
route 0 2 1500 10

Output:
2
0 1 2
0 1 2
ERROR: Deadline cannot be met.
```

This problem requires careful consideration of data structure choices (e.g., adjacency list/matrix for the network graph, priority queues for routing), algorithmic techniques (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search, dynamic programming for packet splitting), and optimization strategies to meet the stringent performance requirements.  Good luck!

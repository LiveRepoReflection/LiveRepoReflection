## Problem: Optimal Multi-Source Shortest Paths with Bottleneck Constraints

**Description:**

Imagine a large-scale transportation network represented as a directed graph. The network consists of `N` cities (nodes) and `M` roads (edges), where each road has a capacity representing the maximum number of vehicles it can handle per unit time.  You are given a set of `K` source cities.

Your task is to design an algorithm to find the optimal routes for transporting goods from *any* of the `K` source cities to *all* other cities in the network.  "Optimal" in this context means minimizing the *bottleneck* capacity along the path. The bottleneck capacity of a path is the *minimum* capacity of any edge on that path.

Specifically, for each destination city `d` (that is *not* one of the `K` source cities), your algorithm must determine:

1.  **The Maximum Bottleneck Capacity:** The maximum bottleneck capacity attainable when routing goods from *any* of the `K` source cities to city `d`. This represents the maximum flow that can be guaranteed along *any* path from a source to the destination. If no path exists from any source to the destination, the bottleneck capacity is 0.

2.  **A Set of Source Cities Contributing to the Maximum Bottleneck Capacity:** A set of source cities `S` such that at least one path exists from each source city in `S` to `d` with a bottleneck capacity equal to the maximum bottleneck capacity found in step 1.  The set `S` should be minimal, meaning no source city can be removed from `S` without violating the condition that at least one optimal path exists to the destination. If the destination `d` is unreachable from all source cities, then `S` is empty. If multiple minimal sets exist, you are free to return any of them.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of cities (nodes) in the network (1 <= `N` <= 10<sup>5</sup>).
*   `M`: The number of roads (edges) in the network (1 <= `M` <= 3 * 10<sup>5</sup>).
*   `edges`: A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, c)` represents a directed road from city `u` to city `v` with capacity `c` (1 <= `u`, `v` <= `N`, 1 <= `c` <= 10<sup>9</sup>).
*   `K`: The number of source cities (1 <= `K` <= `N`).
*   `sources`: A list of `K` city IDs representing the source cities (1 <= `source` <= `N`).

**Output:**

A list of tuples, one for each city that is *not* a source city. Each tuple should contain:

*   `destination`: The ID of the destination city.
*   `max_bottleneck_capacity`: The maximum bottleneck capacity achievable from any source city to the destination city.
*   `minimal_source_set`: A minimal set of source cities that contribute to the maximum bottleneck capacity.

The output list should be sorted in ascending order by `destination` city ID.

**Constraints:**

*   Your algorithm must have a time complexity significantly better than O(N<sup>2</sup> * M) to pass all test cases.  Consider using techniques like binary search and efficient graph traversal algorithms.
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Multiple roads may exist between the same pair of cities, but they will have distinct capacities.
*   The input graph is guaranteed to be valid.

**Example:**

```
N = 5, M = 6,
edges = [(1, 2, 10), (1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 15), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 20), (4, 5, 3)],
K = 2, sources = [1, 2]

Output:

[(3, 5, [1]), (4, 10, [1, 2]), (5, 3, [1, 2])]
```

**Explanation of Example:**

*   **City 3:**  The best path is 1 -> 3 with bottleneck capacity 5. The minimal source set is {1}.
*   **City 4:**  The best paths are 1 -> 2 -> 4 (bottleneck 10) and 2 -> 4 (bottleneck 15). The best capacity is 10. The minimal source set is {1, 2}.
*   **City 5:**  The best paths are 1 -> 3 -> 5 (bottleneck 5), 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 (bottleneck 3), and 2 -> 4 -> 5 (bottleneck 3). The best capacity is 3 (paths through 4 -> 5 bottleneck). The minimal source set is {1, 2}.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Your algorithm must produce the correct `max_bottleneck_capacity` and `minimal_source_set` for all test cases.
*   **Efficiency:** Your algorithm must meet the time complexity constraints. Solutions that are too slow will not pass.
*   **Clarity:** While not directly graded, code readability is encouraged and may be considered in borderline cases.

Okay, here's a challenging problem description suitable for a high-level programming competition.

## Project Name

`DistributedTransactionManager`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction manager (DTM) for a simplified banking system. This system involves multiple independent bank servers (nodes), each managing a subset of customer accounts.  The DTM must ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties across transactions that involve accounts on different bank servers.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionality:

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** A client can initiate a transaction by specifying a list of account operations (transfer, deposit, withdraw) across multiple bank servers.

2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:**  Implement the 2PC protocol to coordinate the transaction across all participating bank servers.

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):** The DTM sends a "prepare" message to all involved bank servers. Each server attempts to perform the requested operations tentatively and votes either "commit" or "abort" based on its ability to successfully execute the operations (e.g., sufficient funds, account existence, etc.). This vote must be durable (e.g., logged to disk).  If any bank server votes "abort", the entire transaction must be rolled back.

    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback Phase):** Based on the votes received in the prepare phase, the DTM sends either a "commit" or "rollback" message to all participating bank servers. Upon receiving the message, each server either permanently commits the changes or rolls back the tentative operations. This final action must also be durable.

3.  **Concurrency Control:** Implement a locking mechanism on each bank server to ensure isolation between concurrent transactions. Use fine-grained locking (e.g., account-level locking) to maximize concurrency. You need to prevent deadlocks.

4.  **Crash Recovery:**  The DTM and bank servers must be able to recover from crashes gracefully. After a crash, the system should be able to resume any in-flight transactions and ensure that they are either completed (committed) or rolled back consistently. You can assume the existence of durable storage (e.g., a file system) for logging transaction states and votes.

5.  **Optimizations:** Aim to minimize the latency of transactions and maximize the throughput of the system.  Consider strategies such as asynchronous communication between the DTM and bank servers, batching of operations, and efficient logging mechanisms.

**Input:**

The system receives transaction requests in the following format:

```
[
  {
    "server_id": "server1",
    "account_id": "account123",
    "operation": "withdraw",
    "amount": 100
  },
  {
    "server_id": "server2",
    "account_id": "account456",
    "operation": "deposit",
    "amount": 100
  }
]
```

**Output:**

The DTM should return a status code indicating whether the transaction was successfully committed (`"committed"`) or aborted (`"aborted"`).  In case of an error (e.g., server unavailable, invalid request), return an appropriate error code (e.g., `"error"`).

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and a growing number of bank servers.

*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to failures of individual bank servers.

*   **Deadlock Prevention:** Implement a strategy to prevent deadlocks, such as a global lock ordering or a timeout-based mechanism.

*   **Efficiency:** Optimize the performance of the system, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

*   **Communication:** You can use any suitable inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism for communication between the DTM and bank servers (e.g., TCP sockets, message queues).

*   **Durability:** Ensure that all critical transaction states and votes are durably persisted to disk to survive crashes.

*   **Data Consistency:**  Guarantee data consistency across all bank servers, even in the presence of failures.

*   **Resource Limits:**  Assume limited memory resources and design your logging mechanism accordingly.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does the system correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure ACID properties?

*   **Performance:** How well does the system perform in terms of latency and throughput under different workloads?

*   **Scalability:** How well does the system scale as the number of bank servers and concurrent transactions increases?

*   **Fault Tolerance:**  How well does the system recover from crashes and failures?

*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

*   **Deadlock Handling:** Does the system effectively prevent deadlocks?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance techniques.  Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed to test advanced data structure knowledge, algorithmic efficiency, and the ability to handle complex real-world constraints.

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a network routing algorithm for a distributed system. The system consists of `n` nodes, uniquely identified by integers from `0` to `n-1`. These nodes communicate with each other over a network. The network's topology is dynamic, meaning connections between nodes can appear and disappear over time.

Your goal is to implement a routing service that efficiently finds the shortest path between any two nodes in the network, given the current network topology and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functions:

1.  **`void initialize(int n)`**: Initializes the routing service for a network of `n` nodes.

2.  **`void add_connection(int node1, int node2, int latency, int bandwidth)`**: Establishes a connection between `node1` and `node2`. The connection is bidirectional. `latency` represents the communication delay between the nodes (in milliseconds), and `bandwidth` represents the data transfer rate (in Mbps).  It's guaranteed that there isn't already an edge between `node1` and `node2`.

3.  **`void remove_connection(int node1, int node2)`**: Removes the connection between `node1` and `node2`.  It's guaranteed that an edge exists between `node1` and `node2`.

4.  **`std::vector<int> find_best_path(int start_node, int end_node, int min_bandwidth, int max_latency)`**: Finds the shortest path (in terms of the number of hops) from `start_node` to `end_node` that satisfies the given QoS requirements:

    *   **`min_bandwidth`**: The minimum bandwidth (in Mbps) required for each connection along the path.
    *   **`max_latency`**: The maximum total latency (in milliseconds) allowed for the entire path.

    The function should return a `std::vector<int>` representing the nodes in the path, starting with `start_node` and ending with `end_node`. If no such path exists, return an **empty** `std::vector<int>`.  If multiple paths with the minimum number of hops exist, return the one with the lowest latency. If there are still ties, return the path with the lowest node IDs (lexicographically - imagine concatenating the node IDs as strings, and choosing the smallest one).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
*   `0 <= node1, node2 < n`
*   `1 <= latency <= 100`
*   `1 <= bandwidth <= 1000`
*   `1 <= min_bandwidth <= 1000`
*   `1 <= max_latency <= 10000`
*   The number of `add_connection` and `remove_connection` calls combined will not exceed 5000.
*   The number of `find_best_path` calls will not exceed 1000.
*   The network may not be fully connected.
*   Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1.
*   Assume that the graph is undirected.

**Example:**

```cpp
NetworkRouting routing_service;
routing_service.initialize(5); // 5 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

routing_service.add_connection(0, 1, 20, 500);
routing_service.add_connection(1, 2, 30, 600);
routing_service.add_connection(0, 3, 50, 400);
routing_service.add_connection(3, 4, 10, 700);
routing_service.add_connection(2, 4, 40, 300);

// Find the best path from node 0 to node 4 with min_bandwidth 450 and max_latency 100
std::vector<int> path = routing_service.find_best_path(0, 4, 450, 100);
// Possible paths:
// 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4  (latency: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90, bandwidth: min(500, 600, 300) = 300 - not valid)
// 0 -> 3 -> 4      (latency: 50 + 10 = 60, bandwidth: min(400, 700) = 400 - not valid)
// Therefore, no path exists and the function should return an empty vector.

//Output: {}

routing_service.add_connection(0, 4, 50, 500);
std::vector<int> path2 = routing_service.find_best_path(0, 4, 450, 100);
// Possible paths:
// 0 -> 4      (latency: 50, bandwidth: 500 - valid)
//Therefore, the function should return {0, 4}.

//Output: {0, 4}

```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must return the correct shortest path that satisfies the QoS requirements.
*   Efficiency: The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints, especially for the `find_best_path` function.  Consider the time complexity of your routing algorithm.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (like BFS or Dijkstra's, potentially with modifications to handle the QoS constraints), efficient data structures to represent the network topology, and careful consideration of edge cases. Good luck!

Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and require careful consideration of various aspects:

**Project Name:** `NetworkOptimization`

**Question Description:**

You are designing the backbone network for a large-scale distributed database system. The system consists of *N* nodes, each identified by a unique integer from 0 to *N*-1. Data needs to be efficiently transferred between these nodes.

The network topology is represented by a graph where nodes are vertices, and direct communication links between nodes are edges. Each link has a certain bandwidth capacity associated with it. The bandwidth is symmetrical (the same in both directions).

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples. Each tuple `(u, v, bandwidth)` represents an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v` with a given `bandwidth`.
*   `queries`: A vector of tuples. Each tuple `(start_node, end_node, required_bandwidth)` represents a data transfer request. For each query, you need to determine if it's possible to route the requested `required_bandwidth` between `start_node` and `end_node` simultaneously for *all* queries, without exceeding the capacity of any link.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  ***Network Topology:*** The network is guaranteed to be connected. However, the graph might contain cycles.

2.  ***Simultaneous Routing:*** You must find routes for *all* queries *simultaneously*. This means that you cannot process each query independently and assume the network is fully available for each one. Each edge can only carry as much bandwidth as its capacity allows, considering all routes that utilize it.

3.  ***Optimization:*** While finding *any* valid routing is acceptable, you are encouraged to minimize the total bandwidth consumption across the entire network.  This isn't strictly required for correctness, but a solution that significantly wastes bandwidth might struggle on larger test cases.

4.  ***Scalability:*** The solution must be scalable to handle networks with a large number of nodes (up to *N* = 1000) and a significant number of edges (up to *E* = 5000). The number of queries can also be large (up to *Q* = 1000).

5.  ***Edge Cases:***
    *   A node may need to send data to itself (start\_node == end\_node). In this case, the query is always satisfied, regardless of the required bandwidth.
    *   The required bandwidth for a query can be 0. In this case, the query is always satisfied.
    *   Multiple edges can exist between two nodes, and you should treat them as separate links.

6.  ***Efficiency:*** Your solution needs to be computationally efficient to avoid exceeding the time limit. Brute-force approaches are unlikely to pass all test cases. Consider appropriate graph algorithms and data structures.

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of nodes.
*   `edges`: A `std::vector<std::tuple<int, int, int>>` representing the network topology.
*   `queries`: A `std::vector<std::tuple<int, int, int>>` representing the data transfer requests.

**Output:**

*   `bool`: `true` if it's possible to satisfy all queries simultaneously without exceeding any link's capacity, `false` otherwise.

**Example:**

```cpp
N = 4
edges = {
    {0, 1, 10},
    {1, 2, 5},
    {2, 3, 15},
    {0, 3, 8}
}
queries = {
    {0, 2, 4},
    {1, 3, 3},
    {0, 3, 7}
}

// Expected Output: true
```

**Rationale for Difficulty:**

*   **NP-Hard Nature:**  The problem, in essence, involves finding paths and allocating bandwidth, which relates to network flow and resource allocation problems, often NP-hard.
*   **Simultaneous Constraints:** The simultaneous routing requirement introduces a level of complexity beyond simple shortest-path algorithms. You need to consider the combined impact of all routes.
*   **Scale:** The size of the network and the number of queries necessitate an efficient algorithm and careful use of data structures.  Naive approaches will likely lead to timeouts.
*   **Multiple Approaches:**  Several approaches are possible, including variations of maximum flow algorithms, approximation algorithms, or even heuristics. Choosing the most effective approach and optimizing it is a key challenge.
*   **Real-world Relevance:** The problem is a simplified model of a real-world network optimization problem, making it conceptually relevant.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques to develop a correct and efficient solution. Good luck!

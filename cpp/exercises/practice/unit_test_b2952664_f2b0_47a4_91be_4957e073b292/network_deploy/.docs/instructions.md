Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed to test a variety of skills in C++.

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkDeployment`

## Question Description

A large telecommunications company is planning to deploy a 5G network in a densely populated urban area. Due to budget constraints and regulatory restrictions, they must strategically place a limited number of base stations to maximize coverage and minimize signal interference.

The city can be represented as a grid of size `N x M`. Each cell `(i, j)` in the grid represents a potential location for a user.  The company has identified `K` candidate locations for base stations.

Each base station has the following properties:

*   **Location:** Coordinates `(x, y)` on the grid.
*   **Power Level:** An integer value `p` representing the signal strength.  Higher power levels provide greater coverage but also contribute more to interference.
*   **Interference Radius:** An integer value `r` representing the radius within which the base station significantly interferes with other base stations.

A user at cell `(i, j)` is considered *covered* if the signal strength from the *closest* base station is greater than or equal to a threshold `T`. Distance is calculated using Manhattan distance: `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

The *interference score* of a deployment is calculated as follows: For every pair of deployed base stations `b1` and `b2`, if the Manhattan distance between them is less than or equal to the *sum* of their interference radii (`r1 + r2`), then the interference between them is `p1 * p2`.  The total interference score is the sum of all such pairwise interferences.

Your task is to select a subset of the `K` candidate base station locations to deploy such that you *maximize* the number of covered users, while *minimizing* the interference score.

**Input:**

*   `N`: Integer, the number of rows in the grid.
*   `M`: Integer, the number of columns in the grid.
*   `K`: Integer, the number of candidate base station locations.
*   `baseStations`: A vector of tuples. Each tuple `(x, y, p, r)` represents a candidate base station at grid coordinates `(x, y)` with power level `p` and interference radius `r`.  `x` and `y` are 0-indexed.
*   `T`: Integer, the minimum signal strength required for coverage.

**Output:**

Return a `std::vector<int>` representing the *indices* (0-indexed, corresponding to the order in `baseStations`) of the selected base stations to deploy.  The selection should aim to maximize coverage while minimizing interference.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N, M <= 100`
*   `1 <= K <= 20`
*   `0 <= x < N` for each base station.
*   `0 <= y < M` for each base station.
*   `1 <= p <= 100` for each base station.
*   `0 <= r <= 10` for each base station.
*   `1 <= T <= 100`

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle all possible combinations of base station deployments within a reasonable time limit (e.g., under 10 seconds).  Brute-force approaches may not be feasible.
*   The problem requires balancing two competing objectives: maximizing coverage and minimizing interference.  The optimal solution may not be the one with the absolute maximum coverage if it results in a very high interference score.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Consider the case where no base stations can provide sufficient coverage to any users.
*   Consider the case where deploying all base stations maximizes coverage but also results in very high interference.
*   Handle duplicate base station locations gracefully.
*   Consider the cases where N, M, or K is very small.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on a weighted score that considers both the number of covered users and the inverse of the interference score.  Higher coverage and lower interference will result in a higher score. Test cases will vary in grid size, number of base stations, and the coverage threshold. Some test cases will heavily penalize high interference, while others will prioritize coverage.

This problem challenges the solver to consider various algorithmic techniques, including:

*   **Bit Manipulation:** Efficiently represent subsets of base stations.
*   **Greedy Algorithms:**  Start with a baseline deployment and iteratively improve it.
*   **Dynamic Programming:**  Potentially optimize the selection process by storing intermediate results.
*   **Heuristics:**  Develop rules of thumb to guide the selection process, especially when dealing with a large number of base stations.
*   **Simulation:** Simulate the signal coverage and interference for a given deployment.

Good luck!

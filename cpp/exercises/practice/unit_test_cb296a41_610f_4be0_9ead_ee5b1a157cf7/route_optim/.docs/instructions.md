Okay, here is a challenging C++ coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, incorporating several elements to increase complexity.

### Project Name

`OptimalRoutePlanning`

### Question Description

A large logistics company, "GlobalTransit," operates a vast network of warehouses and transportation hubs across a continent. They need an efficient route planning system to minimize delivery costs and time. The network is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent locations (warehouses, hubs, cities) and edges represent transportation routes between them. Each route has two associated costs: a monetary cost (e.g., fuel, tolls) and a time cost (e.g., travel time, loading/unloading time).

GlobalTransit wants to optimize routes based on two different priority modes:

1.  **Minimize Cost:** Find the cheapest route between a source and a destination, regardless of time.
2.  **Minimize Time:** Find the fastest route between a source and a destination, regardless of cost.

However, there's a catch!  Certain locations in the network are designated as "Security Zones". Transiting through a Security Zone incurs a dynamic risk penalty, which adds both to the monetary and time costs of the route. The risk penalty for a Security Zone *changes over time*, and GlobalTransit receives updates about these changes regularly.

You are tasked with implementing a route planning system that can efficiently handle these requirements.

**Specifically, you need to implement the following functionality:**

*   **Graph Representation:** Design a suitable data structure to represent the transportation network.  Consider efficiency for large-scale networks (millions of nodes and edges).
*   **Dynamic Security Zone Penalties:** Implement a mechanism to update the monetary and time risk penalties associated with traversing Security Zones. These updates should be efficient to apply without requiring a complete recalculation of all routes.
*   **Route Optimization:** Implement two route finding algorithms:
    *   `findCheapestRoute(source, destination, currentTime)`: Returns the route with the lowest monetary cost from the `source` to the `destination` at the given `currentTime`.
    *   `findFastestRoute(source, destination, currentTime)`: Returns the route with the shortest time from the `source` to the `destination` at the given `currentTime`.
    The `currentTime` parameter is important because security zone penalties are time-dependent.
*   **Route Output:** The returned route should include a list of locations visited (in order), the total monetary cost, and the total time cost.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Graph Size:** The graph can be very large (millions of nodes and edges).
*   **Time Complexity:** Your route finding algorithms must be efficient.  Consider using appropriate graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A\*) and data structures (e.g., priority queues). Aim for complexities better than O(V^2) where V is the number of vertices.
*   **Memory Usage:** Minimize memory usage, especially considering the large graph size.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Applying security zone penalty updates should be fast and efficient.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no route exists between the source and destination, or when the source and destination are the same.
*   **Security Zone Overlap:** A route may pass through multiple Security Zones. Penalties should be cumulative.
*   **Real-World Considerations:** Consider that the network might not be fully connected.
*   **Monetary and Time Costs:** Monetary costs are non-negative floating-point numbers. Time costs are non-negative integers. Security penalties can be zero.

**Input Format (Example):**

The graph data is provided in a file format, which contains Node data, Edge data, and Security Zone data, and Dynamic Penalty update data.

**Node data:** (NodeID, Latitude, Longitude)
**Edge data:** (SourceNodeID, DestinationNodeID, MonetaryCost, TimeCost)
**Security Zone data:** (NodeID, StartTime, EndTime, MonetaryPenalty, TimePenalty)
**Dynamic Penalty data:** (NodeID, StartTime, EndTime, MonetaryPenalty, TimePenalty)

**Output Format (Example):**

A data structure containing the following information:

*   `route`: A vector of node IDs representing the path. Empty if no route exists.
*   `totalMonetaryCost`: The total monetary cost of the route.
*   `totalTimeCost`: The total time cost of the route.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.  Think carefully about how to represent the graph efficiently, how to handle dynamic updates, and how to optimize your route finding algorithms. Good luck!

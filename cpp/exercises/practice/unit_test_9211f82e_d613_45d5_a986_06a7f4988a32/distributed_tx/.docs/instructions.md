## Question Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator with Resource Constraints

### Question Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for a system comprising multiple microservices. Each microservice manages its own independent database and exposes APIs to perform operations. A transaction might involve operations across multiple microservices, requiring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) guarantees.

However, the microservices operate in a resource-constrained environment. Each microservice has limited CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. Furthermore, network latency between microservices can be significant and variable.

Your coordinator must ensure that transactions either commit successfully across all participating microservices, or roll back completely in case of any failure. You should implement a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol or similar distributed transaction protocol with optimizations for the resource-constrained environment.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** Design an API (e.g., a function call) that allows a client to initiate a distributed transaction, specifying the participating microservices and the operations to be performed on each.

2.  **Resource Awareness:** The coordinator must be aware of the resource constraints of each participating microservice (CPU, memory, network). Design a mechanism for the coordinator to gather this information dynamically or statically. Implement a scheduling algorithm within the coordinator that prioritizes operations on microservices with more available resources or lower network latency to minimize transaction completion time.

3.  **Concurrency Control:** Implement a concurrency control mechanism to prevent conflicting transactions from interfering with each other. Consider optimistic or pessimistic locking strategies, taking into account the trade-offs between performance and consistency.

4.  **Failure Handling:** Implement robust failure handling mechanisms to deal with various failure scenarios, including:

    *   Microservice crashes during the prepare or commit phase.
    *   Network partitions preventing communication between the coordinator and microservices.
    *   Coordinator crashes.

    Your solution must ensure that transactions eventually reach a consistent state (either committed or rolled back) even in the presence of failures, even coordinator crash.

5.  **Optimization:** Optimize the performance of the coordinator to minimize transaction completion time and resource consumption. Consider techniques such as:

    *   Batching multiple operations into a single request to reduce network overhead.
    *   Parallelizing operations across multiple microservices where possible.
    *   Using asynchronous communication to avoid blocking the coordinator.
    *   Implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed operations.

6.  **Scalability:** The coordinator should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and a growing number of microservices. Consider using a distributed architecture for the coordinator itself to improve scalability and fault tolerance.

7.  **Logging and Recovery:** Implement durable logging to record the state of transactions.  Upon recovery from a crash, the coordinator should be able to resume incomplete transactions and ensure consistency.  The log should be designed for efficient read/write operations, minimizing disk I/O.

8.  **Performance Evaluation:** Provide a mechanism to measure the performance of the coordinator, including transaction completion time, resource utilization, and throughput.

**Input:**

*   A description of the microservices involved in the transaction, including their resource constraints (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, latency to the coordinator).  This information can be provided statically (e.g., in a configuration file) or dynamically (e.g., through a discovery service).
*   A list of operations to be performed on each microservice as part of the transaction. Each operation is atomic from the perspective of the corresponding microservice.

**Output:**

*   The final status of the transaction (committed or rolled back).
*   Performance metrics, including transaction completion time, resource utilization of each microservice, and throughput of the coordinator.
*   Log entries for each stage of the transaction (prepare, commit, rollback).

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be implemented in C++.
*   The solution must be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions (e.g., 1000+).
*   The solution must be able to handle a large number of microservices (e.g., 100+).
*   The solution must be fault-tolerant and able to recover from various failure scenarios.
*   The solution must minimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) on both the coordinator and the microservices.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly implement the distributed transaction protocol and ensure ACID properties.
*   Performance: The solution must minimize transaction completion time and resource consumption.
*   Scalability: The solution must be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and microservices.
*   Fault Tolerance: The solution must be robust to failures and able to recover from various failure scenarios.
*   Code Quality: The solution must be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, transaction management, concurrency control, failure handling, and performance optimization. The constraints add significant complexity, requiring careful consideration of resource limitations and trade-offs.  Successfully solving this problem demonstrates expertise in designing and implementing robust and efficient distributed systems.

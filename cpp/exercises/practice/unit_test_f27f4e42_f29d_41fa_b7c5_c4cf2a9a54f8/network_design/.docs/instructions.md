## Question Description

You are tasked with designing the deployment strategy for a new high-performance computing (HPC) network. The network consists of `N` computing nodes and `M` potential direct connections (edges) between them. Each node has a specific computational capacity `C[i]` representing its ability to handle workload.  Each potential connection between nodes `u` and `v` has a cost `W[u][v]` representing the expense of establishing that connection (e.g., laying fiber optic cable).

The goal is to select a subset of the `M` possible connections to build a network that meets a minimum network throughput requirement `T` at the lowest possible cost.

The network throughput is defined as follows:

1.  **Flow:**  Consider each pair of nodes `(i, j)` where `i != j`.  The flow between node `i` and node `j` is the maximum possible data flow that can be established between these nodes given the network topology and node capacities. The flow is limited by either the node capacities of `i` and `j` (they cannot send/receive more data than they have capacity for) and the bottleneck in the path between the nodes (the maximum possible flow considering the edges between them). If there is no path between nodes `i` and `j` flow is 0.

2.  **Network Throughput:** The network throughput is calculated as the sum of all pairwise flows across all distinct node pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.

Your task is to write a program that determines the minimum cost to achieve a network throughput of at least `T`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of computing nodes (1 <= `N` <= 50).
*   `M`: The number of potential connections (0 <= `M` <= `N` \* (`N` - 1) / 2).
*   `C`: An array of `N` integers representing the computational capacity of each node (1 <= `C[i]` <= 10<sup>6</sup>).
*   `connections`: A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a potential connection between node `u` and node `v` with cost `w` (0 <= `u`, `v` < `N`; `u` != `v`; 1 <= `w` <= 10<sup>6</sup>).
*   `T`: The minimum required network throughput (1 <= `T` <= 10<sup>9</sup>).

**Output:**

*   The minimum cost to achieve a network throughput of at least `T`. If it's impossible to achieve the required throughput, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be disconnected.
*   There can be multiple paths between any two nodes.
*   You must choose a subset of the connections to minimize cost.
*   Connections are undirected.
*   Nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Brute-force approaches are unlikely to pass all test cases.

**Edge Cases:**

*   `M` = 0 (no possible connections)
*   The required throughput `T` is larger than the maximum possible throughput achievable with all connections.
*   The graph becomes disconnected after removing some edges.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
M = 5
C = [10, 15, 20, 25]
connections = [(0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 10), (1, 2, 8), (1, 3, 12), (2, 3, 15)]
T = 100

Output: 35 (Connect (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3) to achieve the throughput with min cost)
```

**Clarifications:**

*   The maximum flow between two nodes can be calculated using algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp. You may need to adapt these algorithms to consider node capacities.
*   Consider different algorithmic approaches such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or approximation algorithms, and analyze their trade-offs in terms of time complexity and accuracy.

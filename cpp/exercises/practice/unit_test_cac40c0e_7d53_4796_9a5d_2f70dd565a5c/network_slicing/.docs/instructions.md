### Question Description

A telecommunications company is deploying a new 5G network. They want to offer different "network slices" to various customers, each with specific performance guarantees (bandwidth, latency, reliability).  The physical network infrastructure consists of a set of interconnected nodes, each with limited resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth).

Your task is to design an algorithm to optimally allocate network slices onto the physical infrastructure, maximizing the company's profit while respecting the resource constraints of the nodes and the performance requirements of the slices.

**Specifically:**

*   **Physical Network:** Represented as an undirected, weighted graph. Nodes represent physical servers/routers, and edges represent network links. Nodes have `CPU`, `Memory`, and `Bandwidth` capacity. Edges have `Bandwidth` capacity and associated `Latency`.

*   **Network Slices:** Each slice has:
    *   A virtual network topology â€“ another undirected graph, where nodes are virtual machines/containers and edges are virtual links.
    *   Resource requirements for each virtual node (`CPU`, `Memory`, `Bandwidth`).
    *   Bandwidth requirement for each virtual link.
    *   Maximum acceptable end-to-end latency between certain pairs of virtual nodes *within that slice*. Note that these latency requirements only apply to the *mapped path* within the physical network, and must be satisfied.
    *   A revenue value representing the profit gained by successfully deploying this slice.

*   **Mapping:** You must map each virtual node of a slice to a physical node and each virtual link to a path in the physical network. A virtual node can only be mapped to one physical node and a virtual link to one path.

*   **Constraints:**
    *   **Resource Capacity:**  The total `CPU`, `Memory`, and `Bandwidth` allocated to virtual nodes mapped to a physical node must not exceed its capacity. The total `Bandwidth` allocated to virtual links mapped to a physical edge must not exceed its capacity.
    *   **Latency:**  For each slice, the end-to-end latency between the specified virtual node pairs on the mapped path must not exceed the slice's latency requirement. The latency of a path is the sum of the latencies of its edges.

*   **Objective:** Maximize the total revenue from successfully deployed network slices.  A slice is considered "successfully deployed" only if *all* its virtual nodes and links are mapped to the physical network *and* all its latency requirements are met.

**Input:**

*   A description of the physical network graph (nodes, edges, capacities, latencies).
*   A list of network slice requests (virtual network topology, resource requirements, latency requirements, revenue).

**Output:**

*   A mapping of each successfully deployed slice's virtual nodes to physical nodes and virtual links to physical paths.
*   The total revenue generated by the deployed slices.
*   If no slices can be deployed, return an empty mapping and revenue 0.

**Optimization Requirements & Edge Cases:**

*   The number of slices and the size of the physical network can be large (hundreds or thousands of nodes/slices).  Solutions must be reasonably efficient to avoid timing out.
*   The problem is NP-hard, so finding the absolute optimal solution might be computationally infeasible for large inputs.  Focus on developing a good heuristic or approximation algorithm.
*   Consider cases where some slices can be partially deployed (e.g., most nodes/links mapped, but one latency constraint is violated). You still only receive revenue if a slice is *fully* deployed.
*   Consider cases where multiple slices compete for the same physical resources. The algorithm should prioritize deployments that maximize overall revenue.
*   Edge cases include:
    *   Slices that cannot be deployed due to insufficient physical resources.
    *   Slices that cannot be deployed due to latency constraints, even if resources are available.
    *   Empty physical network or empty slice request list.
    *   Disconnected physical or virtual networks.
    *   Zero resource requirements for nodes or links.
* The graph is not directed.

**Judging Criteria:**

Solutions will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:**  The solution must produce valid mappings that satisfy all resource and latency constraints.
*   **Profit Maximization:**  The solution should maximize the total revenue from deployed slices.
*   **Efficiency:**  The algorithm should run within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few minutes) for realistic network sizes.
*   **Handling of Edge Cases:** The solution should gracefully handle all edge cases without crashing or producing incorrect results.
*   **Code Clarity and Structure:** The code should be well-organized, commented, and easy to understand.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, resource allocation, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

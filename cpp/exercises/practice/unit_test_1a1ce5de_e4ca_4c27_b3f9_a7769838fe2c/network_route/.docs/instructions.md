Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed with high difficulty and the elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `OptimizedNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a highly efficient routing algorithm for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, numbered from 0 to `N-1`. The connections between the nodes are represented by a set of bidirectional links, each with a specific latency.  The network is not necessarily fully connected.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology, a source node `S`, and a destination node `D`, finds the path with the *minimum average latency per hop*.  This is different from standard shortest path algorithms that minimize total latency. Minimizing average latency per hop will encourage the algorithm to take paths with lower latency on each link, avoiding congested or slow links.

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 10^5).
*   `links`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a bidirectional link in the network. Each tuple has the form `(u, v, latency)`, where `u` and `v` are integers representing the two nodes connected by the link (0 <= u, v < N, u != v), and `latency` is an integer representing the latency of the link (1 <= latency <= 10^4).  There can be multiple links between any two nodes.
*   `S`: An integer representing the source node (0 <= S < N).
*   `D`: An integer representing the destination node (0 <= D < N).

**Output:**

*   Return a `vector<int>` representing the optimal path from the source node `S` to the destination node `D` that minimizes the average latency per hop. The path should start with `S` and end with `D`.  If no path exists between `S` and `D`, return an empty `vector<int>`. If multiple optimal paths exist, return any one of them.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Input:** `N` can be as large as 10^5, and the number of links can be significantly larger. This requires efficient data structures and algorithms.
*   **Average Latency Optimization:** The primary goal is to minimize the *average* latency per hop, not the total latency. This requires a different approach than standard shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford.
*   **Multiple Links:** There can be multiple links between two nodes with different latencies. The algorithm should consider all available links.
*   **Cycles:** The network may contain cycles.
*   **Disconnected Graph:** The graph may be disconnected; return an empty vector if there's no path between S and D.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.  Solutions with O(N^2) complexity or higher are unlikely to pass all test cases.  Consider algorithms with complexities closer to O(E log V) or O(V + E) where E is the number of edges.
*   **Numerical Stability:**  Be careful about potential floating-point precision issues when calculating and comparing average latencies.
*   **Memory Management:** Ensure your solution is memory-efficient, especially with large graphs. Avoid unnecessary copying of large data structures.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as S = D, no links in the network, and invalid input values gracefully.
*   **Real-world scenario:** The problem is inspired by network packet routing, where minimizing the delay per hop is more important than total delay.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal algorithms, careful optimization, and attention to detail.  Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem description:

**Problem Title: Optimal Traffic Flow Router**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal traffic flow router for a smart city. The city's road network is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent roads. Each road has a capacity, representing the maximum number of vehicles that can travel on that road per unit of time, and a *dynamic* travel time. The travel time on a road is a function of the traffic flow on that road, which means travel time changes depending on how many vehicles are using the road. Higher traffic increases travel time.

Specifically, the travel time `t_ij` for road (i, j) is given by:

`t_ij = base_t_ij * (1 + congestion_factor * (flow_ij / capacity_ij)^exponent)`

Where:

*   `base_t_ij` is the base travel time for road (i, j) when no vehicles are on it.
*   `capacity_ij` is the maximum capacity of road (i, j) (vehicles per unit time).
*   `flow_ij` is the current traffic flow on road (i, j) (vehicles per unit time).
*   `congestion_factor` and `exponent` are global constants that describe how much congestion affects travel time. These constants can be globally defined.

You are given a set of trip requests, each specifying a source intersection, a destination intersection, and the number of vehicles wanting to travel from source to destination.

Your objective is to determine the *optimal* traffic flow for each road in the network to minimize the *average travel time* across *all* trip requests.

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

1.  **Graph Description:**
    *   `N`: Number of intersections (nodes), indexed from 0 to N-1.
    *   `M`: Number of roads (edges).
    *   `M` lines, each describing a road: `u v capacity base_travel_time`.
        *   `u`: Source intersection.
        *   `v`: Destination intersection.
        *   `capacity`: Road capacity.
        *   `base_travel_time`: Base travel time.

2.  **Trip Requests:**
    *   `K`: Number of trip requests.
    *   `K` lines, each describing a trip request: `source destination num_vehicles`.
        *   `source`: Source intersection.
        *   `destination`: Destination intersection.
        *   `num_vehicles`: Number of vehicles for this trip.

3.  **Global Parameters:**
    *   `congestion_factor`: A floating-point number.
    *   `exponent`: A floating-point number.

**Output Format:**

Output `M` lines, each representing the optimal traffic flow for each road (in the order they were provided in the input) rounded to two decimal places. If there is no valid route between the source and destination, the flow should be 0.00.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `1 <= M <= 500`
*   `1 <= K <= 100`
*   `0 <= u, v, source, destination < N`
*   `1 <= capacity <= 1000`
*   `1 <= base_travel_time <= 100`
*   `1 <= num_vehicles <= 100`
*   `0.0 <= congestion_factor <= 1.0`
*   `1.0 <= exponent <= 3.0`
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Multiple roads can exist between two intersections (allowing for parallel roads).
*   The solution must be computationally efficient.  Brute force solutions or naive implementations of shortest path algorithms will likely time out.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the *average travel time* for all trip requests. Average travel time is calculated as the sum of (number of vehicles * travel time for each trip) divided by the total number of vehicles across all trips.
*   The solution must converge to a reasonably optimal flow distribution within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 seconds).
*   The traffic flow on each road must be non-negative and cannot exceed the road's capacity.

**Edge Cases:**

*   No path exists between the source and destination for some trip requests.
*   The optimal flow distribution might involve splitting traffic across multiple paths.
*   The graph may contain cycles.

**Judging:**

Your solution will be judged based on its ability to find a flow distribution that minimizes the average travel time across all trip requests within the time limit.  Test cases will include a variety of graph structures, traffic patterns, and trip requests to assess the robustness and efficiency of your solution. Solutions that time out or produce incorrect flow distributions will receive a lower score.

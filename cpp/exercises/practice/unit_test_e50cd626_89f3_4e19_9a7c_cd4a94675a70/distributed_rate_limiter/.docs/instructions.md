Okay, here's a challenging C++ programming problem designed to be similar in difficulty to a LeetCode Hard level question, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and system design aspects, without providing the solution:

**Problem Title: Distributed Rate Limiter**

**Problem Description:**

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter. Imagine you're building a large-scale online service that handles millions of requests per second. To protect your service from abuse and ensure fairness, you need a rate limiter that restricts the number of requests a user (identified by a unique user ID) can make within a given time window.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Architecture:**  The rate limiter must be designed to work across multiple servers/instances.  This means you cannot rely on in-memory data structures on a single machine to enforce the rate limits.

2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limit should be configurable. You should be able to set different rate limits for different users or user groups. For example, a premium user might have a higher rate limit than a free user.  The rate limits are defined as (requests, time window in seconds).

3.  **Atomic Operations:**  Since the rate limiter is distributed, you need to ensure that all operations (checking the rate limit, incrementing request count) are atomic to avoid race conditions and ensure accurate rate limiting.

4.  **Persistence:**  The rate limiter state (request counts, timestamps) must be persistent.  If a server crashes or restarts, the rate limiting should resume correctly based on the previous state. Consider a failure-resistant data store for persistence.

5.  **Efficiency:**  The rate limiter must be highly efficient. Checking and updating the rate limit should be fast (ideally O(1) or close to it on average). The system should be able to handle a high volume of requests without introducing significant latency.

6.  **Scalability:** The system needs to be horizontally scalable, you should design a solution that can adapt to a growing number of concurrent users.

7.  **Fault Tolerance**: Your solution needs to be resilient to node failures.

8.  **Time Expiry**: The solution should be able to handle time expiry of rate limits, for example, requests older than the time window should be purged to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

9.  **Concurrency**: Your solution should be able to handle concurrent requests from different threads or processes.

**Input:**

The rate limiter should provide a function `bool allowRequest(userID, timestamp)` which takes:

*   `userID`: A unique identifier for the user making the request (e.g., an integer or a string).
*   `timestamp`: The time at which the request was made (e.g., Unix timestamp in seconds).

**Output:**

The `allowRequest` function should return:

*   `true` if the request is allowed (i.e., the user is within their rate limit).
*   `false` if the request is rejected (i.e., the user has exceeded their rate limit).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of users can be very large (millions or billions).
*   The request rate can be very high (thousands or millions of requests per second).
*   The rate limits can vary significantly between users.
*   Consider the potential for clock skew across different servers in your distributed system.
*   Memory usage should be optimized. Storing every request timestamp for every user is not feasible.

**Considerations:**

*   Think carefully about the data structures you will use to store the rate limiter state.
*   Consider using a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis, Memcached) or a distributed database (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB) for persistence and atomic operations.
*   Explore different rate limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window counter, sliding window log, sliding window counter) and choose the one that best suits the requirements.
*   Consider the trade-offs between accuracy, performance, and complexity.
*   Think about how to handle clock skew between different servers.
*   Think about how to deal with node failures and ensure fault tolerance.

**Example:**

```c++
// Assuming you have a RateLimiter class
RateLimiter limiter;
limiter.setRateLimit(12345, 10, 60); // User 12345: 10 requests per 60 seconds

if (limiter.allowRequest(12345, time(0))) {
  // Process the request
} else {
  // Reject the request
}
```

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. It is designed to be challenging and open-ended, allowing candidates to demonstrate their ability to design and implement a complex system with real-world constraints. Good luck!

## Question Description

Design a system for analyzing a social network's activity to detect emerging trends, influential users, and potential coordinated malicious activity.

You are given a stream of events representing user interactions within the social network. Each event contains the following information:

*   **timestamp:** (long) The time at which the event occurred (Unix epoch milliseconds).
*   **eventType:** (enum) The type of interaction: `POST`, `COMMENT`, `LIKE`, `SHARE`, `FOLLOW`.
*   **userId:** (string) The ID of the user initiating the event.
*   **targetId:** (string, optional) The ID of the target user or post that the event is directed towards (e.g., the user being followed, the post being commented on, the post being liked/shared).  This field is null if the event isn't directed (e.g., a user creating a new post).
*   **content:** (string, optional) The content of the post or comment, if applicable.  This is null for LIKE, SHARE, and FOLLOW events.

Your system must support the following analytical queries, with strict performance requirements on both latency and throughput:

1.  **Trending Topics:**  Return the top *k* trending topics (keywords) within a specified time window *W*. The trending score for a topic should consider both the frequency of the keyword and the recency of the posts containing it. Implement a decay function to give more weight to recent occurrences.
2.  **Influencer Ranking:**  Maintain a ranked list of the top *k* most influential users in the network. Influence is determined by the user's activity (posting, commenting, liking, sharing), the engagement they generate (likes, comments, shares on their posts), and their connectivity (number of followers).  Implement different weighting factors for each of these components, tunable by the user.  The system should be able to update the ranking in near real-time as new events arrive.
3.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify potential coordinated malicious activity.  This involves detecting groups of users exhibiting unusual behavior patterns, such as:
    *   Sudden bursts of activity targeting a specific user or topic.
    *   Highly synchronized posting or commenting behavior across multiple users.
    *   Unusually high rates of follow/unfollow actions.
    *   Content similarity across multiple users (potential spam or propaganda campaigns).

**Constraints:**

*   The system must handle a very high volume of events (millions per second).
*   Queries must return results with low latency (e.g., within milliseconds for trending topics, a few seconds for influencer ranking).
*   The system should be scalable to handle a large and growing social network with billions of users and posts.
*   Memory usage should be optimized.
*   The system should be fault-tolerant and resilient to failures.
*   Assume the content is English and is expected to be tokenized by space.
*   *k* and *W* can be provided during runtime.

**Requirements:**

*   Describe the overall architecture of your system, including the key components and their interactions.
*   Explain the data structures and algorithms used for each analytical query.
*   Discuss the trade-offs involved in your design choices, particularly regarding performance, scalability, and accuracy.
*   Address how you would handle edge cases and potential attacks (e.g., spam, bot activity, adversarial keyword stuffing).
*   Provide a high-level implementation plan, highlighting the core logic for each query.  Focus on the algorithmic aspects rather than low-level implementation details.
*   Justify your choice of programming language and technologies.  While the problem specifies C++, you can motivate the use of other languages or frameworks if you believe they are better suited for the task.
*   Provide time and space complexity analysis for the key operations.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a dynamic weighting mechanism for the influencer ranking, allowing the system to automatically adjust the weights based on the observed network behavior and user feedback.
*   Incorporate machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection.
*   Design a user interface for visualizing the analytical results and configuring the system parameters.

This problem requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, system design principles, and real-world challenges in social network analysis. A successful solution will demonstrate the ability to balance performance, scalability, accuracy, and robustness in a complex and demanding environment.

Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging C++ problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:  Optimal Task Scheduling with Deadlines and Dependencies**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduling algorithm for a high-performance computing cluster.  You have a set of `N` tasks to execute. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id_i`: A unique integer identifier for the task (1 <= `id_i` <= N).
*   `duration_i`: The amount of time (in milliseconds) required to execute the task.
*   `deadline_i`: A deadline (in milliseconds) by which the task must be completed. The deadline is relative to the start of the entire scheduling process (time 0).
*   `dependencies_i`: A list of task IDs that must be completed *before* task `i` can start. A task can have zero or more dependencies.

Your goal is to create a schedule that maximizes the *total value* of completed tasks before their deadlines.  The value of each task is a constant 1.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

1.  The first line contains a single integer `N`, representing the number of tasks (1 <= `N` <= 1000).
2.  The next `N` lines each describe a task in the following format:

    `id_i duration_i deadline_i dependency_count d_1 d_2 ... d_{dependency_count}`

    *   `id_i`: The task's ID.
    *   `duration_i`: The task's duration.
    *   `deadline_i`: The task's deadline.
    *   `dependency_count`: The number of dependencies for this task.
    *   `d_1 d_2 ... d_{dependency_count}`: A list of `dependency_count` task IDs that are dependencies of task `id_i`.

    All task IDs (`id_i` and `d_j`) are integers between 1 and `N` (inclusive). Task IDs are unique.

**Output:**

Your program should output a single integer representing the maximum total value (number of completed tasks) that can be achieved by scheduling the tasks optimally while respecting dependencies and deadlines.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Dependencies:** The task dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). There will be no circular dependencies.
*   **Deadlines:**  A task is considered "completed" if its entire execution finishes *before or at* its deadline.
*   **Optimization:**  The algorithm must be efficient. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.  Consider using dynamic programming, topological sorting, or other optimization techniques.
*   **Tie-breaking:** If multiple optimal schedules exist, any one of them is acceptable. You only need to output the maximum value.
*   **Time Limit:** 2 seconds.
*   **Memory Limit:** 256 MB.
*   **Input Size:** Duration and deadline values will fit within a 32-bit integer.

**Example Input:**

```
4
1 10 20 0
2 15 30 1 1
3 5 25 1 1
4 20 40 2 2 3
```

**Explanation of Example:**

*   Task 1: ID 1, Duration 10, Deadline 20, No dependencies.
*   Task 2: ID 2, Duration 15, Deadline 30, Dependency: Task 1.
*   Task 3: ID 3, Duration 5, Deadline 25, Dependency: Task 1.
*   Task 4: ID 4, Duration 20, Deadline 40, Dependencies: Task 2, Task 3.

**Example Output:**

```
4
```

**Rationale for Difficulty:**

*   The problem combines scheduling, dependency management, and deadline constraints, requiring a solid understanding of algorithmic techniques.
*   The need for optimization makes brute-force solutions impractical, pushing contestants towards more sophisticated algorithms.
*   The DAG structure of dependencies adds another layer of complexity, necessitating topological sorting or similar techniques.
*   The problem can be solved using multiple approaches (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy with topological sort), each with its own trade-offs, allowing for differentiation between contestants.
*   The time and memory constraints are tight enough to penalize inefficient implementations.

This problem requires careful planning and efficient coding to achieve a correct and performant solution. Good luck!

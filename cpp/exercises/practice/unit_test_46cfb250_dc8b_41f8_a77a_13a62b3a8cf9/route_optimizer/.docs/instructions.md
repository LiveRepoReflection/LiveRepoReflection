Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard difficulty question.

## Problem: Autonomous Vehicle Route Optimization

**Problem Description:**

You are developing the route planning system for an autonomous vehicle fleet operating in a large, complex city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments connecting them. Each road segment has a travel time (in seconds), a toll cost (in USD), and a congestion level (an integer from 1 to 5, where 1 is free-flowing and 5 is heavily congested).

Given a starting intersection, a destination intersection, a maximum travel time budget (in seconds), and a maximum toll budget (in USD), your task is to find the *least congested* route that satisfies both the time and toll constraints.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of intersections in the city (numbered 0 to n-1).
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a directed road segment in the form `(start_intersection, end_intersection, travel_time, toll_cost, congestion_level)`.
*   `start`: The starting intersection.
*   `destination`: The destination intersection.
*   `max_travel_time`: The maximum allowed travel time (in seconds).
*   `max_toll_cost`: The maximum allowed toll cost (in USD).

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the *sum of congestion levels* along the least congested route that satisfies the given constraints. If no such route exists, return -1.  If the start and destination are the same return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `n` <= 1000
*   0 <= `edges.size()` <= 5000
*   0 <= `start`, `destination` < `n`
*   1 <= `travel_time` <= 100
*   0 <= `toll_cost` <= 50
*   1 <= `congestion_level` <= 5
*   1 <= `max_travel_time` <= 10000
*   0 <= `max_toll_cost` <= 5000

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.  Naive solutions are likely to time out.
*   Consider how your solution scales as the city size (`n`) and the number of road segments (`edges.size()`) increase.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = {
    (0, 1, 50, 5, 2),
    (0, 2, 100, 10, 3),
    (1, 2, 50, 0, 1),
    (1, 3, 150, 20, 4),
    (2, 3, 50, 5, 2),
    (2, 4, 100, 10, 3),
    (3, 4, 100, 0, 1)
}
start = 0
destination = 4
max_travel_time = 350
max_toll_cost = 30

// One possible route: 0 -> 2 -> 4 (Time: 200, Toll: 20, Congestion: 3 + 3 = 6)
// Another possible route: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (Time: 200, Toll: 5, Congestion: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6)
// Another possible route: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (Time: 250, Toll: 15, Congestion: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6)
// The optimal route is 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, so the output is 6
```
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <tuple>

int solve(int n, const std::vector<std::tuple<int, int, int, int, int>>& edges, int start, int destination, int max_travel_time, int max_toll_cost) {
    // Your code here
}
```

Good luck! This problem requires careful consideration of graph traversal, constraint satisfaction, and optimization techniques.

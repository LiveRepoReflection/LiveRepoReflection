## The Quantum Network Routing Problem

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a nascent quantum network. This network consists of `N` quantum nodes, uniquely numbered from `0` to `N-1`.  Each node possesses the capability to generate and maintain entangled qubits.

The physical connections between the nodes are represented as a weighted, undirected graph. The weight of each edge represents the *fidelity loss* associated with transmitting a qubit along that connection.  Lower weights represent higher fidelity.

Classical control channels exist between all nodes, allowing for coordination and routing information to be exchanged.

**Goal:**

Given a quantum network topology (nodes and weighted edges), a set of `M` quantum communication requests, and a *maximum acceptable fidelity loss* `K`, determine the optimal route for each communication request.

A quantum communication request is defined by a source node `S`, a destination node `D`, and a *minimum required entanglement fidelity* `F`.

The *fidelity loss* of a path is the sum of the weights of the edges along that path. The *entanglement fidelity* after transmission is calculated as `F_after = F * exp(-loss)`, where `loss` is the fidelity loss of the path.

Your solution must:

1.  For each communication request, find a path from the source node to the destination node such that the entanglement fidelity at the destination is greater than or equal to the minimum required fidelity.  That is, `F * exp(-loss) >= F`. The 'loss' cannot be greater than K.
2.  If multiple paths satisfy the fidelity requirement, choose the path with the *lowest fidelity loss*. This minimizes resource consumption.
3.  If no path satisfies the fidelity requirement or if the lowest fidelity loss of the paths that satisfy the fidelity requirement is greater than K, report that the request cannot be fulfilled.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of quantum nodes (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)` representing the edges of the network. `u` and `v` are the node numbers (0 <= u, v < N), and `w` is the fidelity loss (0 <= w <= 1000). There can be multiple edges between two nodes.
*   `M`: The number of quantum communication requests (1 <= M <= 1000).
*   `requests`: A list of tuples `(S, D, F)` representing the communication requests. `S` is the source node, `D` is the destination node (0 <= S, D < N), and `F` is the minimum required entanglement fidelity (0.0 < F <= 1.0).
*   `K`: The *maximum acceptable fidelity loss* (0 <= K <= 10000).

**Output:**

A list of `M` results. Each result is either:

*   The fidelity loss of the optimal path if a suitable path is found. The fidelity loss is a floating-point number rounded to six decimal places.
*   `-1` if no path satisfies the fidelity requirement or the lowest fidelity loss is greater than K.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Multiple edges may exist between two nodes.
*   The same source and destination nodes may appear in multiple requests.
*   The fidelity loss `w` of each edge is non-negative.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 15), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 20), (2, 3, 10)]
M = 2
requests = [(0, 3, 0.8), (1, 2, 0.9)]
K = 50

Output:
[25.000000, 5.000000]
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Request 1 (0, 3, 0.8):**  Two paths exist from node 0 to node 3:
    *   Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 3. Fidelity loss = 10 + 20 = 30.  Fidelity after = 0.8 * exp(-30) = 8.9e-14. F_after < F, so this path is invalid.
    *   Path 2: 0 -> 2 -> 3. Fidelity loss = 15 + 10 = 25. Fidelity after = 0.8 * exp(-25) = 1.3e-10. F_after < F, so this path is invalid.
    *   Path 3: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3. Fidelity loss = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25. Fidelity after = 0.8 * exp(-25) = 1.3e-10. F_after < F, so this path is invalid.
    The lowest fidelity loss is 25. Fidelity after is 0.8 * exp(-25).
     Since K is 50 and F_after < F, the output is 25.000000.

*   **Request 2 (1, 2, 0.9):**  One direct path exists from node 1 to node 2:
    *   Path 1: 1 -> 2. Fidelity loss = 5. Fidelity after = 0.9 * exp(-5) = 0.00605. F_after < F, so this path is invalid.
    Since K is 50 and F_after < F, the output is 5.000000.
**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly identify the optimal path and its fidelity loss for each request, or correctly report that no path satisfies the requirement.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be efficient enough to handle the given constraints.  Solutions with high time complexity may time out. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms for graph traversal and pathfinding.
*   Precision: The fidelity loss must be rounded to six decimal places.

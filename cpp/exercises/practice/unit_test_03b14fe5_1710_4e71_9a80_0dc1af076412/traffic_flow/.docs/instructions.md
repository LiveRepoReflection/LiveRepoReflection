## Problem: Optimal Traffic Flow

**Description:**

The city of Algorithmia is experiencing severe traffic congestion. As a renowned software engineer, you are tasked with designing an algorithm to optimize traffic flow in a specific region of the city.

The region is modeled as a directed graph. Each node represents an intersection, and each directed edge represents a one-way street connecting two intersections. Each street has a *capacity*, representing the maximum number of vehicles that can traverse it per unit of time.

To simplify the problem, we consider only two types of vehicles: *cars* and *trucks*. Cars occupy 1 unit of capacity on a street, while trucks occupy *k* units of capacity, where *k* is a given integer.

You are given the following inputs:

*   A directed graph represented as an adjacency list, where each edge also stores the street's capacity.
*   A source intersection (start node).
*   A destination intersection (end node).
*   The value *k*, representing the capacity units occupied by a single truck.
*   The number of cars that need to travel from the source to the destination.
*   The number of trucks that need to travel from the source to the destination.

Your goal is to determine the **maximum** number of vehicles (cars + trucks) that can successfully travel from the source to the destination, given the street capacities and the capacity occupied by trucks. The number of cars and trucks used cannot exceed the specified number of cars and trucks.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of intersections (nodes) *n* is between 2 and 100.
*   The number of streets (edges) *m* is between 0 and *n*(n-1).
*   The capacity of each street is between 1 and 1000.
*   The value *k* is between 2 and 10.
*   The number of cars and trucks are between 0 and 1000.
*   The source and destination intersections are distinct.

**Optimization Requirements:**

Your solution should be efficient enough to handle large graphs and significant numbers of cars and trucks within a reasonable time limit (e.g., within 1 second).

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph may not be connected.
*   There may be no path between the source and destination.
*   Even if a path exists, the capacity may be insufficient to accommodate all cars and/or trucks.
*   The optimal solution might involve only sending cars, only sending trucks, or a combination of both.

**System Design Aspects (Implicit):**

Consider how your algorithm would scale if the number of vehicle types increased or if real-time traffic updates were required. (This is not directly part of the coding challenge, but thinking about it will help with algorithm design).

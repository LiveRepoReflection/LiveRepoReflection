Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed to test advanced algorithmic and data structure skills, along with optimization and system design considerations.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Ordering

**Description:**

You are designing a distributed database system that guarantees serializable transactions.  To achieve this, you need to implement a system for ordering transactions across multiple nodes. Each transaction consists of a series of operations (read/write) on different data items, potentially residing on different nodes.

Each node in the system generates transaction proposals. A transaction proposal includes:

*   A unique transaction ID (`txID` - a 64-bit unsigned integer).
*   The node ID that proposed the transaction (`nodeID` - a small integer, e.g., 0-255).
*   A list of data items involved in the transaction (`dataItems` - each data item is identified by a 64-bit unsigned integer).
*   The transaction's critical section duration (`duration` - a 32-bit unsigned integer representing time units).
*   A boolean flag indicating whether the transaction is read-only (`readOnly`).

Your task is to implement a central ordering service that receives transaction proposals from multiple nodes and produces a globally consistent, serializable order of transactions. The ordering must respect the following constraints:

1.  **Causal Consistency:** If node A sends transaction T1 and then sends transaction T2, the ordering must ensure that T1 precedes T2. You can assume each node maintains a monotonically increasing sequence number for its transactions. The `txID` can encode this sequence number (e.g., higher bits represent node ID and lower bits represent sequence number).

2.  **Conflict Serializability:** The ordering must ensure that conflicting transactions (transactions accessing overlapping `dataItems`) are serialized. Read-write conflicts and write-write conflicts must be prevented. Read-only transactions can be executed concurrently as long as they don't conflict with write transactions.

3.  **Minimize Latency:** The ordering service must minimize the latency experienced by transactions.  Transactions should be ordered and released for execution as quickly as possible.

4.  **High Throughput:** The system must handle a high volume of transaction proposals.

5.  **Fairness:** Transactions from different nodes should be treated fairly. No single node should consistently experience significantly higher latency than others.

**Input:**

The ordering service receives a stream of transaction proposals. Each proposal is represented by the following structure:

```cpp
struct TransactionProposal {
    uint64_t txID;
    uint8_t nodeID;
    std::vector<uint64_t> dataItems;
    uint32_t duration;
    bool readOnly;
};
```

**Output:**

The ordering service must output a stream of ordered transaction IDs (`txID`).  The output stream represents the order in which transactions should be executed.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement the core ordering logic in C++.
*   You are free to use any standard C++ libraries.  Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., priority queues, trees, hash maps) to optimize performance.
*   The ordering service must be thread-safe.  You should use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to handle concurrent access from multiple nodes.
*   Assume the number of nodes is fixed and known in advance.
*   Assume the set of possible data items is large (e.g., on the order of billions).

**Constraints:**

*   The ordering service must maintain a bounded memory footprint.  You cannot store all transaction proposals indefinitely. Design your system to handle a continuous stream of transactions.
*   The latency for ordering a transaction should be minimized, ideally in the millisecond range.
*   The ordering service should be able to handle a sustained throughput of thousands of transactions per second.
*   The number of data items per transaction can vary, but is generally small (e.g., less than 10).
*   The system should be robust to handle out-of-order arrival of transaction proposals within a reasonable time window (e.g. due to network delays).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does the solution produce a serializable and causally consistent transaction order?
*   **Performance:**  What is the average latency and throughput achieved by the ordering service?
*   **Scalability:** How does the performance of the ordering service scale with the number of nodes and transaction volume?
*   **Memory Usage:** What is the memory footprint of the ordering service?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control mechanisms, and efficient data structures. It also requires careful consideration of performance trade-offs. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging C++ programming problem designed to be difficult and comprehensive, pushing the solver to consider efficiency, data structures, and real-world constraints.

## Question: Distributed Transaction Manager

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory, distributed transaction manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture.  Imagine you have several independent services (represented as `Service` objects), each managing its own data. To maintain data consistency across these services, you need to implement atomic transactions that span multiple services.

Your DTM should support the following operations:

1.  **BeginTransaction():** Starts a new distributed transaction and returns a transaction ID (TID). TIDs are unique, positive integers.

2.  **Enlist(TID, Service):** Adds a `Service` to a transaction identified by `TID`. A `Service` can only be enlisted once per transaction. If the `TID` does not exist, or the `Service` is already enlisted, the operation should fail (return `false`).

3.  **Prepare(TID):**  Initiates the "prepare" phase of the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.  For each enlisted `Service` in the transaction, it calls the `Prepare()` method of the `Service`. If any of the `Service::Prepare()` calls return `false`, the entire transaction must be aborted.  Otherwise, the DTM should record that the transaction is "prepared" but not yet committed.

4.  **Commit(TID):**  Initiates the "commit" phase of the 2PC protocol. If the transaction is in the "prepared" state, the DTM calls the `Commit()` method on all enlisted services. If the transaction is not in the "prepared" state (e.g., it was never prepared, or the prepare phase failed), the DTM should return `false`.

5.  **Rollback(TID):** Initiates the rollback phase. If the transaction is in "prepared" state or any enlisted service rejected the prepare, the DTM calls the `Rollback()` method on all enlisted services.

**`Service` Interface:**

You are provided with the following interface for a `Service`:

```cpp
class Service {
public:
    virtual bool Prepare() = 0; // Returns true if the service is ready to commit, false otherwise.
    virtual void Commit() = 0;  // Commits the local transaction within the service.
    virtual void Rollback() = 0; // Rolls back the local transaction within the service.
    virtual ~Service() {}
};
```

**Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The DTM must be thread-safe, allowing multiple transactions to run concurrently.
*   **Efficiency:** Minimize lock contention and overhead.  The system should scale well with a large number of concurrent transactions and services. The `Prepare`, `Commit`, and `Rollback` operations might involve network calls to the individual services, so minimize blocking.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle potential errors gracefully, especially during the prepare phase. If a `Service` fails during the prepare phase, the entire transaction must be rolled back.
*   **Atomicity:**  Ensure that either all enlisted services commit, or all enlisted services rollback.
*   **Durability:** While this is an in-memory DTM, think about how you would handle persistence of transaction state in a real-world scenario. (No actual persistence required for this problem, but the design should be amenable to it).
*   **Deadlock Prevention:** Prevent deadlocks between transactions.

**Constraints:**

*   You can use standard C++ libraries (STL) and any threading/synchronization primitives available in the standard library.
*   You cannot use external libraries (e.g., Boost).
*   Assume the number of services is significantly larger than the number of concurrent transactions.
*   The `Prepare()`, `Commit()`, and `Rollback()` methods on the `Service` objects can be slow (network latency).

**Specific Implementation Details:**

1.  Implement a class `DistributedTransactionManager` with the methods described above.

2.  Choose appropriate data structures to store transaction metadata (e.g., enlisted services, transaction state). Consider the concurrency requirements when selecting these data structures.

3.  Implement the 2PC protocol correctly, handling potential failures during the prepare phase.

4.  Consider how to implement a timeout mechanism for the `Prepare` phase. If a service takes too long to prepare, the transaction should be rolled back.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a deadlock detection mechanism and resolution strategy.
*   Introduce a "recovery" mechanism to handle DTM restarts. (Describe how you would persist and restore transaction state. No implementation is required).

This problem is designed to evaluate your understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, data structures, and algorithm design. The key is to create a robust, efficient, and thread-safe DTM that adheres to the constraints and requirements outlined above. Good luck!

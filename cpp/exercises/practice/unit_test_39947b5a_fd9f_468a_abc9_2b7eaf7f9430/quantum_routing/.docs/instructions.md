## The Quantum Network Routing Problem

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a robust and efficient routing algorithm for a nascent quantum network. This network consists of `n` quantum nodes, numbered from 0 to `n-1`. Each node can potentially be connected to any other node via a quantum channel. However, due to the inherent instability of quantum communication, each channel has a probabilistic success rate. A message sent across a channel only has a certain probability of arriving successfully.

The network topology and channel success probabilities are provided as a weighted adjacency matrix `P[n][n]`. `P[i][j]` represents the probability (a double between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive) that a quantum message sent directly from node `i` to node `j` will arrive successfully. If `P[i][j] = 0.0`, it indicates that there is no direct quantum channel between nodes `i` and `j`. Note that the matrix `P` is not necessarily symmetric (i.e., `P[i][j]` may not be equal to `P[j][i]`).

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology `P`, a source node `start`, a destination node `end`, and a message, finds the path with the *highest probability of successful delivery* from the `start` node to the `end` node. If no path exists between the start and end nodes (i.e., it is impossible to send the message), return 0.0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
*   `0 <= start < n`
*   `0 <= end < n`
*   `0.0 <= P[i][j] <= 1.0` for all `0 <= i < n` and `0 <= j < n`
*   The message is purely symbolic and does not affect the routing algorithm.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Naive approaches (e.g., brute-force) will likely time out. Aim for a solution with a time complexity better than O(n!).
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize the search for the path with the highest probability.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The `start` and `end` nodes can be the same. In this case, the probability of successful delivery is 1.0.
*   The network may be disconnected.
*   The probabilities can be very small, requiring attention to precision issues.

**System Design Considerations:**

*   Although not explicitly required for the coding solution, consider how this routing algorithm could be integrated into a larger quantum network management system. Think about how to handle dynamic network changes (e.g., channel failures) and scaling to larger networks.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

There are potentially multiple valid approaches to solve this problem, each with its own trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and implementation complexity. For example, you could adapt algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford to work with probabilities instead of distances. Dynamic programming might also be applicable. The challenge is to find the most efficient and robust solution.

Good luck!

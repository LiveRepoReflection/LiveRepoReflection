Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard level, incorporating several elements to increase complexity:

**Problem Title:** Highly Available Key-Value Store with Tiered Storage

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly available, distributed key-value store.  This system must handle a large number of read and write requests per second while maintaining data consistency and durability.  To optimize for cost and performance, the store utilizes a tiered storage architecture.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **High Availability:** The system must tolerate node failures. Data should be replicated to multiple nodes to ensure availability even if some nodes are down.

2.  **Strong Consistency:**  The system must provide strong consistency for read and write operations.  A read operation should always return the most recent value written to a key.

3.  **Tiered Storage:** The key-value store consists of two storage tiers:
    *   **Memory Tier (Cache):**  Fast but expensive. Limited capacity.  Stores the most frequently accessed key-value pairs. Implemented with a LRU cache.
    *   **Disk Tier (Persistent Storage):** Slower but cheaper.  Large capacity. Stores all key-value pairs persistently.

4.  **Scalability:**  The system should be horizontally scalable to handle increasing load.

5.  **Durability:** Data written to the store must be durable and survive system restarts.

**Functional Requirements:**

Implement the following functions:

*   `bool put(string key, string value)`:  Writes the key-value pair to the store. The write operation should first update the cache (Memory Tier) and then asynchronously persist the data to the disk (Persistent Tier). It needs to ensure strong consistency. Return `true` if the write was successful, `false` otherwise.
*   `optional<string> get(string key)`:  Retrieves the value associated with the given key. The retrieval process should first check the cache (Memory Tier). If the key is present in the cache, return the value directly from the cache. If the key is not present in the cache, retrieve the value from the disk (Persistent Tier), update the cache with the retrieved value, and return the value. If the key is not found on disk, return `nullopt`.
*   `bool deleteKey(string key)`: Deletes the key-value pair from the store. Delete the key from the cache and disk tier.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Performance:**  `get` and `put` operations should have low latency. Aim for average latency under 10ms for `get` and 20ms for `put` under moderate load.
2.  **Concurrency:**  The system must handle concurrent read and write operations efficiently. Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:**  Simulate node failures.  The system should automatically recover from node failures and maintain data consistency. Consider how to handle scenarios where the cache and persistent storage are inconsistent due to failures.
4.  **Scalability:** The design should be scalable. Consider techniques such as data partitioning and replication.

**Constraints:**

*   **Memory Limit:** Assume a limited memory capacity for the cache (e.g., 1 GB).
*   **Disk Limit:** Assume a large but finite disk capacity (e.g., 1 TB).
*   **Number of Nodes:** The system should be designed to run on a cluster of machines (e.g., 3-5 nodes).
*   **Key-Value Size:**  Assume key and value sizes can vary, but on average, key sizes are around 50 bytes and value sizes are around 500 bytes.
*   **Concurrency:** The system should support a high degree of concurrency.

**Considerations:**

*   **Cache Invalidation:**  How to handle cache invalidation when data is updated or deleted.
*   **Data Replication:**  How to replicate data across multiple nodes for fault tolerance. Consider using techniques like Paxos or Raft for consensus.
*   **Data Partitioning:** How to partition data across multiple nodes to improve scalability. Consistent hashing is a good candidate.
*   **Asynchronous Writes:** Implement asynchronous writes to the disk tier to minimize latency for `put` operations.  Use a write-behind caching strategy.
*   **Recovery:** How to recover from node failures and ensure data consistency.
*   **Serialization:** Implement a method for serializing data to persist it on disk.
*   **Failure Scenarios:** Design for various failure scenarios, including network partitions, node crashes, and disk failures.
*   **LRU Cache Implementation**: You need to implement your own LRU Cache, do not use any off-the-shelf implementation.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement support for range queries (e.g., `getValues(string keyPrefix)`).
*   Add metrics to monitor system performance (e.g., latency, throughput, cache hit rate).
*   Implement a mechanism for handling conflicting writes (e.g., using timestamps or version vectors).

This problem is designed to be open-ended and allows for different approaches and trade-offs. The goal is to assess the candidate's ability to design a complex system, consider various constraints and requirements, and write efficient and robust code. Good luck!

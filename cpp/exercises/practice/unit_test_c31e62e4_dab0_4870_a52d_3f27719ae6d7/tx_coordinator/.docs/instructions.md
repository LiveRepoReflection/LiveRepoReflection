Okay, here's a challenging C++ programming problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard difficulty level, incorporating elements like advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world scenarios.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture.  Imagine you have multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) that need to participate in atomic transactions.  Your coordinator must ensure ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across these services.

Each service exposes a simple `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` operation. Your coordinator will manage the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol to guarantee that either all participating services commit the transaction, or all rollback.

**Input:**

1.  `N`: The number of services participating in a transaction. (1 <= N <= 1000)
2.  A list of `N` service endpoints. Each endpoint is represented by a unique string identifier.
3.  `M`: The number of concurrent transactions to process (1 <= M <= 100,000)
4.  A stream of transaction requests. Each request consists of:
    *   `transaction_id`: A unique integer identifier for the transaction.
    *   `involved_services`: A list of string identifiers representing the services participating in this specific transaction. A service can participate in multiple concurrent transactions.

**Service Behavior (Simulated):**

You will simulate the behavior of each service with the following simplified rules:

*   **`prepare(transaction_id)`:**  The service performs necessary checks and resource locking. It returns `true` (vote commit) if it's ready to commit, and `false` (vote abort) otherwise. A service can only have one prepared transaction at a time. If a second `prepare` call comes for the same service *before* a commit or rollback of the first prepared transaction, the service should return `false`. The `prepare` call can take a random amount of time to simulate network latency (e.g., between 0 and 10 milliseconds).

*   **`commit(transaction_id)`:** The service persists the changes associated with the transaction. This operation always succeeds if the `prepare` phase was successful earlier for the same `transaction_id`. The `commit` call can take a random amount of time to simulate network latency (e.g., between 0 and 10 milliseconds).

*   **`rollback(transaction_id)`:** The service undoes any changes made during the transaction. This operation always succeeds, regardless of whether `prepare` was called or not.  The `rollback` call can take a random amount of time to simulate network latency (e.g., between 0 and 10 milliseconds).

**Output:**

For each transaction request, your coordinator should output one of the following:

*   `"COMMIT <transaction_id>"`: If all participating services voted to commit.
*   `"ABORT <transaction_id>"`: If at least one participating service voted to abort.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Concurrency:** The transaction coordinator must handle multiple concurrent transactions efficiently. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, condition variables) to prevent race conditions.
2.  **Deadlock Avoidance:**  The service endpoints must be prepared in a consistent order across all transactions to prevent deadlocks.  Order the services lexicographically by their string identifier before sending `prepare` requests.
3.  **Timeout:** If a service does not respond to a `prepare`, `commit`, or `rollback` request within a specified timeout (e.g., 50 milliseconds), the coordinator should consider the service unavailable and abort the transaction. The timeout should be configurable.
4.  **Resource Limits:**  Minimize memory usage. The number of active transactions at any given time will be limited, but the total number of transactions `M` can be very large. Avoid storing large amounts of data per transaction unnecessarily.
5.  **Error Handling:**  Gracefully handle service failures and network errors. Implement retry mechanisms (with exponential backoff) for `prepare` requests, up to a maximum number of retries (e.g., 3 retries). Don't retry `commit` or `rollback`.
6.  **Optimization:** The coordinator must be highly performant.  Minimize latency and maximize throughput. Consider using thread pools or asynchronous I/O to improve concurrency.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
3  // N = 3 services
service1
service2
service3
2  // M = 2 transactions
100 service1,service2  // transaction_id = 100, services = service1, service2
101 service2,service3  // transaction_id = 101, services = service2, service3
```

**Possible Output:**

```
COMMIT 100  // Assuming service1 and service2 both vote to commit
ABORT 101  // Assuming service3 votes to abort, or times out.
```

**Hints:**

*   Use a thread pool to manage concurrent transactions.
*   Use a `std::map` to store the state of each transaction (e.g., participating services, votes, status).
*   Use `std::chrono` for measuring timeouts.
*   Use mutexes to protect shared data structures.
*   Consider using condition variables to signal events (e.g., all services have voted).
*   Implement a retry mechanism for `prepare` requests with exponential backoff.
*   Pay close attention to memory management and resource usage.

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, distributed systems concepts, and efficient C++ programming practices. Good luck!

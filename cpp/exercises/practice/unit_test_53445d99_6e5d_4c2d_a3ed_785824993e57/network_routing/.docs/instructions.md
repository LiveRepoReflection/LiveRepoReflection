### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.  The network topology is dynamic, meaning the connection latency between nodes changes over time.  Your goal is to process a series of routing requests as efficiently as possible, adapting to these latency changes.

Specifically, you will receive the following types of input:

1.  **Network Initialization:** `init(N, initial_latencies)`. This initializes the network with `N` nodes. `initial_latencies` is a vector of tuples `(u, v, latency)`, where `u` and `v` are node IDs (0-indexed), and `latency` is a positive integer representing the initial latency of the direct link between nodes `u` and `v`. Assume the graph is undirected, so the link between `u` and `v` is the same as the link between `v` and `u`.  If a link is *not* present in `initial_latencies`, assume the latency between those nodes is initially infinite (effectively, no direct link).

2.  **Latency Update:** `update_latency(u, v, latency)`. This updates the latency of the direct link between nodes `u` and `v` to `latency`. If `latency` is -1, it means the link between `u` and `v` is removed. The graph is undirected.

3.  **Routing Request:** `find_shortest_path(start_node, end_node, timestamp)`. Given a `start_node` and an `end_node`, you must find the shortest path between them *at the given `timestamp`*.  The `timestamp` represents a point in time. The latency updates accumulate over time. Each `update_latency` has an implicit timestamp equal to when the function is called. The shortest path should use the most recent latency value between any two nodes **at or before** the provided `timestamp`. If no path exists between `start_node` and `end_node` at or before `timestamp`, return an empty vector.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
*   `0 <= u, v < N` (Node IDs)
*   `1 <= initial_latencies.size() <= N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   `1 <= latency <= 1000` (Latency values, except for -1 for link removal)
*   `1 <= number of update_latency calls <= 10000`
*   `1 <= number of find_shortest_path calls <= 10000`
*   Timestamps will always increase. You do not need to handle out-of-order timestamps.
*   You need to return a vector of node IDs representing the shortest path, *including* the start and end nodes. If multiple shortest paths exist, return any one of them.
*   The solution needs to be as efficient as possible, particularly `find_shortest_path`, so pre-computation or caching strategies are encouraged.

**Example:**

```cpp
// Initial Network
init(4, {{0, 1, 5}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 2}});

// Find shortest path at timestamp 10
// Expected path: {0, 1, 2, 3} (cost: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10)
find_shortest_path(0, 3, 10);

// Update latency at timestamp 20
update_latency(1, 2, 1);

// Find shortest path at timestamp 30
// Expected path: {0, 1, 2, 3} (cost: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8)
find_shortest_path(0, 3, 30);

// Remove link at timestamp 40
update_latency(2, 3, -1);

// Find shortest path at timestamp 50
// Expected path: {} (no path exists)
find_shortest_path(0, 3, 50);
```

**Considerations for Difficulty:**

*   **Dynamic Graph:** The graph changes over time, requiring you to manage latency updates efficiently.
*   **Timestamped Queries:** You need to retrieve the correct latency information for a specific point in time.
*   **Shortest Path Algorithm:** You'll need an efficient shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra or A*) that can be adapted to the dynamic nature of the graph.
*   **Optimization:**  Naive implementations (recomputing the shortest path from scratch for every query) will likely time out. Consider caching strategies, pre-computation (where possible), and efficient data structures.

This problem challenges the solver to:

*   Choose appropriate data structures for representing the graph and managing latency updates (e.g., adjacency lists/matrices, timestamped latency storage).
*   Implement an efficient shortest path algorithm that can handle dynamic edge weights.
*   Design a caching or pre-computation strategy to optimize query performance.
*   Handle various edge cases, such as disconnected graphs, no path between nodes, and edge removals.

Good luck! Let me know if you'd like any clarifications.

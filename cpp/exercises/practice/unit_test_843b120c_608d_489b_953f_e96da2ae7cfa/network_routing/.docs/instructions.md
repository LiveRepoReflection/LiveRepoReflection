Okay, here's a challenging C++ problem designed to be suitable for a high-level programming competition, aiming for LeetCode "Hard" difficulty.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

A large-scale distributed system comprises a network of `N` nodes (numbered 1 to `N`) interconnected via bidirectional communication channels. Each channel connects two distinct nodes and has a positive latency associated with it. The latency represents the time it takes for a message to travel between the two connected nodes. The network topology is sparse, meaning that each node is directly connected to a relatively small subset of other nodes.

The system is responsible for routing a high volume of messages between various node pairs. Given a series of `Q` routing requests, your task is to design and implement an efficient routing algorithm that minimizes the maximum latency experienced by any individual message.

Each routing request specifies a source node `src` and a destination node `dest`. Your algorithm must determine a path through the network that connects `src` and `dest`. The latency of a path is the sum of the latencies of the communication channels along that path.

**Objective:**

Minimize the *maximum* latency across *all* `Q` routing requests. In other words, find a solution that minimizes the longest path taken by any individual request.

**Input:**

1.  `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= `N` <= 100,000).
2.  `M`: The number of communication channels (1 <= `M` <= 200,000).
3.  A list of `M` tuples, each representing a communication channel: `(u, v, latency)`. This indicates a bidirectional channel between nodes `u` and `v` with the given `latency` (1 <= `u`, `v` <= `N`, 1 <= `latency` <= 1000).
4.  `Q`: The number of routing requests (1 <= `Q` <= 100,000).
5.  A list of `Q` tuples, each representing a routing request: `(src, dest)`. This indicates a request to route a message from node `src` to node `dest` (1 <= `src`, `dest` <= `N`, `src` != `dest`).

**Output:**

A list of `Q` integers, where the `i`-th integer represents the latency of the path found for the `i`-th routing request.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Time Limit:** Your solution must complete within a strict time limit (e.g., 5 seconds). Inefficient algorithms will likely time out.
*   **Memory Limit:** Your solution must use a reasonable amount of memory (e.g., 256 MB).
*   **Correctness:** Your solution must correctly find a path between the source and destination nodes for each routing request. If there is no path between two nodes, report `-1`.
*   **Optimization:** The primary goal is to minimize the *maximum* latency among all requests.  A solution that simply finds the shortest path for each request independently may not be optimal.
*   **Disconnected Graphs:** The network might be disconnected, meaning there might not be a path between all pairs of nodes.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where `src` and `dest` are the same node, or where no path exists.

**Scoring:**

Your score will be based on the *maximum* latency among all the routing requests in your output.  Lower maximum latency scores higher. Test cases will include a variety of network topologies and request patterns designed to challenge different routing strategies.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search as building blocks.
*   Think about how to balance the latencies across all requests to minimize the maximum.  Simply finding the shortest path for each request individually is unlikely to be the best approach. You may need to make some paths longer so that the maximum is minimized.
*   Offline processing or precomputation might be helpful, but ensure it doesn't exceed the time limit during the online phase of processing the requests.
*   Consider different data structures for representing the network topology to optimize performance.
*   Parallelization might be beneficial for improving performance, but consider the overhead carefully.

This problem emphasizes algorithmic design, data structure selection, and optimization techniques. It requires a good understanding of graph algorithms and the ability to think strategically about minimizing the maximum latency across a set of routing requests. Good luck!

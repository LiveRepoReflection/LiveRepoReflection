Okay, I'm ready to generate a new, challenging C++ coding problem. Here it is:

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkDeployment`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a cost-effective communication network for a distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each requiring a certain level of communication bandwidth with every other node.  These nodes are geographically dispersed, and laying direct communication links between all nodes is prohibitively expensive. To reduce costs, you can deploy a limited number of high-capacity relay stations.  Nodes can communicate with each other directly via a dedicated link or indirectly via one or more relay stations.

**Specifics:**

*   **Nodes:**  There are `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. Each node `i` has a bandwidth requirement `B[i][j]` with every other node `j`. `B[i][j]` is guaranteed to be equal to `B[j][i]`.  `B[i][i]` is always 0.
*   **Relay Stations:** You can deploy at most `R` relay stations. Relay stations can be placed at any location and have infinite bandwidth capacity. The placement of a relay station doesn't affect bandwidth requirements, only the cost.
*   **Link Costs:** The cost of establishing a direct communication link between node `i` and node `j` is given by `C[i][j]`. `C[i][j]` is guaranteed to be equal to `C[j][i]`. `C[i][i]` is always 0.
*   **Relay Connection Costs:** The cost of connecting a node `i` to a relay station is a fixed cost `RelayCost`. Each node may connect to multiple relay stations.
*   **Network Connectivity:** All nodes `i` must be able to communicate with all other nodes `j` at the required bandwidth `B[i][j]`. This communication can be direct, or through one or more relay stations. If a node utilizes one or more relay stations, the cost is the cumulative `RelayCost` for each relay station the node connects to. The cost of communication between any two nodes `i` and `j` is the minimum of the direct cost `C[i][j]` and the total `RelayCost` associated with connecting to a sufficient number of relay stations. A node can also choose to connect to zero relay stations.
*   **Optimization Goal:** Your goal is to determine the *minimum total cost* to ensure all bandwidth requirements are met. This includes the cost of direct links and the cost of connecting nodes to relay stations.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes (1 <= N <= 200).
*   `R`: The maximum number of relay stations (0 <= R <= N).
*   `B`: A 2D vector of integers representing the bandwidth requirements. `B[i][j]` represents the bandwidth requirement between node `i` and node `j`. (0 <= B[i][j] <= 1000).
*   `C`: A 2D vector of integers representing the cost of direct links. `C[i][j]` represents the cost of a direct link between node `i` and node `j`. (0 <= C[i][j] <= 10000).
*  `RelayCost`: An integer representing the cost of connecting a node to a relay station. (0 <= RelayCost <= 10000).

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the minimum total cost to satisfy all bandwidth requirements.

**Constraints:**

*   Time Limit: 5 seconds.
*   Memory Limit: 256 MB.
*   The input will always be such that a solution exists.
*   Minimize the number of direct links created.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
R = 2
B = {{0, 5, 2, 1}, {5, 0, 3, 2}, {2, 3, 0, 4}, {1, 2, 4, 0}}
C = {{0, 10, 5, 3}, {10, 0, 7, 4}, {5, 7, 0, 6}, {3, 4, 6, 0}}
RelayCost = 2

// Possible Solution:
// Connect all nodes to both relay stations. Cost = 4 * 2 * 2 = 16
// No direct links required since relay stations provide sufficient communication.
// Optimal Cost = 16
```

**Challenge Considerations:**

*   The optimal solution may involve a mix of direct links and relay station connections.
*   The problem involves combinatorial optimization.  The number of possible configurations grows rapidly with `N` and `R`.
*   Efficient data structures and algorithms are needed to explore the solution space effectively.
*   Consider how to efficiently determine if a proposed network configuration meets all bandwidth requirements.
*   Think about how to prune the search space to avoid exploring suboptimal configurations.

This problem requires careful consideration of algorithmic techniques like graph theory, dynamic programming, or potentially heuristics/approximations if a guaranteed optimal solution within the time limit proves too difficult. Good luck!

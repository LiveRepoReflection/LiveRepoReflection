## Question: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Resource Constraints

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduler for a complex system. The system consists of `N` tasks, labeled from `0` to `N-1`. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `duration[i]`: The time (in abstract units) it takes to complete task `i`.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of tasks that must be completed before task `i` can start. This is represented as a list of task IDs. The dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   `resource_requirements[i]`: A list of resource IDs that task `i` requires to execute.  There are `M` distinct resource types, labeled from `0` to `M-1`.

The system has a limited amount of each resource. You are given an array `resource_capacities` of size `M`, where `resource_capacities[j]` represents the number of units of resource `j` available in the system.  A task can only be executed if all its resource requirements can be satisfied simultaneously, meaning the number of available units for each required resource is greater than or equal to the task's demand.

Your goal is to find the **minimum makespan** possible for completing all `N` tasks. The makespan is defined as the time when the last task finishes executing.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   `M`: The number of resource types (1 <= M <= 100).
*   `duration`: A vector of integers of size `N`, where `duration[i]` is the duration of task `i` (1 <= duration[i] <= 100).
*   `dependencies`: A vector of vectors of integers of size `N`, where `dependencies[i]` is a vector containing the task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start.
*   `resource_requirements`: A vector of vectors of integers of size `N`, where `resource_requirements[i]` is a vector containing the resource IDs that task `i` requires.  A resource can be required multiple times.
*   `resource_capacities`: A vector of integers of size `M`, where `resource_capacities[j]` is the capacity of resource `j` (1 <= resource_capacities[j] <= 100).

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the minimum makespan required to complete all `N` tasks. If it's impossible to schedule all tasks due to dependency cycles or resource limitations, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   The dependency graph is a DAG (no cycles).
*   All task IDs in `dependencies` are valid (0 <= task ID < N).
*   All resource IDs in `resource_requirements` are valid (0 <= resource ID < M).
*   Multiple tasks can run concurrently, as long as their resource requirements don't exceed the resource capacities and their dependencies are satisfied.
*   The solution must be optimized for time complexity. Brute-force or exponential-time solutions will not pass.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
M = 2
duration = [5, 3, 2, 4]
dependencies = [[], [0], [0, 1], [2]]
resource_requirements = [[0], [1], [0, 1], [0]]
resource_capacities = [2, 1]
```

In this example, the optimal schedule would be:

1.  Task 0 starts at time 0, finishes at time 5. Resource 0 is used (1 unit).
2.  Task 1 starts at time 5, finishes at time 8. Resource 1 is used (1 unit).
3.  Task 2 starts at time 8, finishes at time 10. Resources 0 and 1 are used (1 unit each).
4.  Task 3 starts at time 10, finishes at time 14. Resource 0 is used (1 unit).

The makespan is 14.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Dependency Handling:** Correctly handle dependencies between tasks.
*   **Resource Management:** Efficiently allocate and release resources to minimize idle time.
*   **Optimization:** Explore various scheduling strategies and find the one that minimizes the makespan.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where scheduling is impossible due to resource constraints or dependency issues.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be efficient for larger values of `N` and `M`.

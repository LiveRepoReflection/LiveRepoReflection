Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging C++ coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Autonomous Vehicle Routing with Dynamic Obstacles**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for an autonomous vehicle navigating a grid-based city. The city is represented by a 2D grid of size `N x M`, where each cell can be either:

*   `0`: An open road, traversable by the vehicle.
*   `1`: A blocked road, initially impassable.

The vehicle starts at a designated cell `(start_row, start_col)` and needs to reach a destination cell `(end_row, end_col)`. The vehicle can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move takes one unit of time.

However, the challenge lies in the dynamic nature of the environment. At certain time steps, roads may become blocked or unblocked due to events like construction, accidents, or traffic management. You are given a series of `K` events, each represented by a tuple `(time, row, col, type)`.

*   `time`: The time step at which the event occurs.
*   `row`: The row index of the cell affected by the event.
*   `col`: The column index of the cell affected by the event.
*   `type`: `0` if the cell at `(row, col)` becomes an open road, `1` if it becomes a blocked road.

Your goal is to find the *minimum time* required for the vehicle to reach the destination, considering the dynamic changes in the grid. If the vehicle cannot reach the destination at any point, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   `1 <= N, M <= 500`
*   `0 <= K <= 10000`
*   `0 <= start_row, end_row < N`
*   `0 <= start_col, end_col < M`
*   `0 <= time <= 100000`
*   The start and end cells are initially open roads (value 0).
*   The vehicle can only move to adjacent open road cells.
*   The vehicle cannot move outside the grid boundaries.
*   The events are not necessarily sorted by time. Multiple events can occur at the same time.
*   **Optimization Requirement**: The solution must be efficient enough to handle large grids and a significant number of events within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1-2 seconds). Inefficient solutions using naive pathfinding at each time step will likely time out.
*   **Multiple Valid Approaches**: There are multiple ways to approach this problem, each with different trade-offs in terms of time complexity and memory usage. Consider techniques like A*, Dijkstra's, or dynamic programming variations, potentially in combination with data structures to efficiently manage the dynamic grid. It is possible to precompute the grid by applying all the events, but doing so might exceed time or memory limitations.
*   **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases such as:
    *   The start and end cells being the same.
    *   The start or end cell being blocked at the initial time.
    *   The destination becoming unreachable at some point during the journey.
    *   No valid path exists, even without considering the dynamic obstacles.

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   `N`: The number of rows in the grid.
*   `M`: The number of columns in the grid.
*   `grid`: A 2D vector of integers representing the initial state of the grid.
*   `start_row`: The starting row index of the vehicle.
*   `start_col`: The starting column index of the vehicle.
*   `end_row`: The destination row index of the vehicle.
*   `end_col`: The destination column index of the vehicle.
*   `K`: The number of events.
*   `events`: A vector of tuples `(time, row, col, type)` representing the events.

**Output Format:**

Return the minimum time required for the vehicle to reach the destination. If the vehicle cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

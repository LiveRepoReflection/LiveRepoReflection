Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging C++ problem description:

## Project Name

`NetworkOptimization`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and optimizing a communication network for a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` computing nodes, labeled from `0` to `N-1`. These nodes need to exchange data frequently, and the network's performance is critical to the overall system efficiency.

The network's topology is represented by an adjacency matrix `adjMatrix` of size `N x N`. `adjMatrix[i][j]` represents the communication latency (in milliseconds) between node `i` and node `j`. If `adjMatrix[i][j] == -1`, it means there is no direct connection between node `i` and node `j`.  The network is undirected, meaning `adjMatrix[i][j] == adjMatrix[j][i]`.

To improve network performance, you can deploy a limited number of specialized "accelerator" nodes. These accelerator nodes can significantly reduce communication latency for nodes connected to them.  When a node `i` is connected to an accelerator node `A`, the latency between `i` and any other node `j` in the network is calculated as follows:

*   If there is a path from `i` to `j` through `A`, then the latency from `i` to `j` is `adjMatrix[i][A] + adjMatrix[A][j]`.
*   If there is no path from `i` to `j` through `A`, keep the original latency in `adjMatrix[i][j]`.
*   If there is no direct connection between `i` and `j` (meaning `adjMatrix[i][j] == -1`), determine the shortest path between them in the original network. If there is no such path, keep `adjMatrix[i][j] == -1`.

You are given the following:

*   `N`: The number of computing nodes.
*   `adjMatrix`: The initial adjacency matrix representing the network topology.
*   `K`: The maximum number of accelerator nodes you can deploy.

Your task is to determine the optimal placement of the `K` accelerator nodes to minimize the **average latency** between all pairs of nodes in the network. The average latency is calculated as the sum of all pairwise latencies (considering the shortest path between any two nodes) divided by the total number of pairs (N * (N-1) / 2).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 50`
*   `0 <= K <= 5`
*   `-1 <= adjMatrix[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `adjMatrix[i][i] == 0` for all `i`
*   The initial network may not be fully connected.
*   You must select `K` distinct nodes to be accelerator nodes.

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of computing nodes.
*   `adjMatrix`: A 2D vector of integers representing the adjacency matrix.
*   `K`: An integer representing the maximum number of accelerator nodes.

**Output:**

*   A double representing the minimum possible average latency achievable by deploying `K` accelerator nodes optimally.  The output should be accurate to within `10^-6`.

**Example:**

Let's say we have `N=4`, `K=1` and `adjMatrix = {{0, 5, -1, 10}, {5, 0, 3, -1}, {-1, 3, 0, 2}, {10, -1, 2, 0}}`.  You need to find the best single node to deploy an accelerator on to minimize the average latency between all node pairs.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:**  The output must be the minimum possible average latency.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must run within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Given the small size of `N` and `K`, an optimized brute-force approach combined with efficient shortest-path calculations might be viable, but clever pruning and efficient data structures are encouraged.
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** The solution must correctly handle disconnected networks, negative latencies represented by -1, and other potential edge cases.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Floyd-Warshall algorithm to precompute all-pairs shortest paths in the original graph.
*   Think about how to efficiently update the shortest path matrix after adding an accelerator node.
*   Explore optimization techniques like pruning to reduce the search space. You might not need to evaluate all possible combinations of accelerator node placements.
*   Pay attention to floating-point precision when calculating the average latency.

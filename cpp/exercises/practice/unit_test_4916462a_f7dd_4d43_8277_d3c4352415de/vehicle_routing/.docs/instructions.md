Okay, here's a challenging C++ problem description, designed to be difficult and incorporate several advanced concepts:

**Problem Title:**  Autonomous Vehicle Routing with Dynamic Obstacles and Resource Constraints

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with developing a routing algorithm for an autonomous vehicle operating in a dynamic environment.  The vehicle must navigate from a starting point (S) to a destination (D) on a grid-based map.  The map consists of cells that are either traversable ('.') or initially blocked ('#').

However, the environment is not static.  At certain discrete time steps, new obstacles appear and existing obstacles disappear.  You are provided with a sequence of obstacle configurations, where each configuration represents the state of the grid at a specific time step. The vehicle can only move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) in each time step. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

Furthermore, the vehicle has a limited fuel capacity. Each move consumes one unit of fuel. The vehicle starts with a given amount of fuel (F). If the vehicle runs out of fuel before reaching the destination, it fails. At certain locations on the grid, there are charging stations ('C'). When the vehicle moves to a charging station, its fuel is replenished to its maximum capacity (F).  The vehicle can only visit a limited number of charging stations (K).

The objective is to find the shortest possible sequence of moves (in terms of time steps) that allows the vehicle to reach the destination without running out of fuel, while respecting the dynamic obstacle configurations and the charging station visit limit.  If no such path exists, report that the destination is unreachable.

**Input:**

*   `N`:  The size of the grid (N x N). 1 <= N <= 100
*   `F`:  The initial and maximum fuel capacity of the vehicle. 1 <= F <= 50
*   `K`:  The maximum number of charging stations the vehicle can visit. 0 <= K <= 5
*   `M`: The number of obstacle configurations provided. 1 <= M <= 50
*   `grid[0]`: A 2D character array representing the initial state of the grid ('.' traversable, '#' blocked, 'S' start, 'D' destination, 'C' charging station). There will be exactly one 'S' and one 'D'. There can be zero or more 'C's.
*   `obstacles[1...M-1]`: A sequence of M-1 2D character arrays, each representing the obstacle configuration at time step `t`. obstacle[t] is the grid state at time t. The start 'S', end 'D', and charging station 'C' positions remain constant throughout all configurations. Only the '#' and '.' change.

**Output:**

*   The minimum number of time steps required for the vehicle to reach the destination.
*   If the destination is unreachable, output -1.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The vehicle *must* reach the destination at a time step when the destination cell is traversable.
*   The grid size (N) and the number of obstacle configurations (M) can be relatively large, requiring efficient algorithms.
*   The limited fuel capacity and the constraint on the number of charging station visits add significant complexity.
*   Multiple valid paths might exist; you need to find the shortest one.
*   The obstacle configurations change at each time step, making simple pathfinding algorithms insufficient.
*   Optimizing for time complexity is crucial.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures to efficiently represent the grid and the dynamic obstacle configurations.
*   The start and end points are *always* traversable.

**Example:**

Let's say the vehicle needs to navigate a 3x3 grid. It starts with 5 units of fuel, can visit at most 1 charging station, and has 2 obstacle configurations to consider:

*   N = 3
*   F = 5
*   K = 1
*   M = 2

Initial grid (grid[0]):

```
S..
.#.
..D
```

Obstacle configuration at time step 1 (obstacles[1]):

```
S..
...
#CD
```

One possible optimal path could be: (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(1,2)->(2,2) using no charging stations and taking 4 steps.

**Judging:**

Your code will be judged on its correctness (ability to find a valid path when one exists and correctly report unreachable when none exists) and its efficiency (ability to solve the problem within reasonable time and memory constraints). Test cases will include various grid sizes, obstacle configurations, fuel capacities, and charging station arrangements. Some test cases will have large N and M values.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, dynamic programming, and careful optimization to achieve an efficient solution. Good luck!

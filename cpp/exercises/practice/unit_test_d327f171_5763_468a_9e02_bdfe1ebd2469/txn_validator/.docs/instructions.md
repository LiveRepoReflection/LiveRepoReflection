Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging C++ problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Validator**

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a distributed system where multiple services collaborate to execute transactions. Each transaction involves a series of operations performed by different services.  To ensure data consistency and reliability, a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is used.  However, due to network instability and service failures, transactions can become inconsistent, leading to data corruption.

Your task is to implement a transaction validator that analyzes a log of transaction events and determines whether the transactions were executed correctly according to the 2PC protocol.

**Input:**

The input consists of a log file represented as a string. Each line in the log file represents a transaction event.  Each line is formatted as follows:

`TransactionID,ServiceID,EventType,Timestamp`

Where:

*   `TransactionID`: A unique alphanumeric identifier for the transaction (e.g., "Tx123").
*   `ServiceID`: A unique alphanumeric identifier for the service involved in the transaction (e.g., "ServiceA").
*   `EventType`: A string representing the type of event.  Possible event types are:
    *   `PREPARE`: The service has prepared for the transaction.
    *   `COMMIT`: The service has committed the transaction.
    *   `ABORT`: The service has aborted the transaction.
    *   `COORDINATOR_COMMIT`: The transaction coordinator has issued a global commit.
    *   `COORDINATOR_ABORT`: The transaction coordinator has issued a global abort.
*   `Timestamp`: A Unix timestamp (integer) representing the time the event occurred.

The log file may contain events from multiple concurrent transactions, and the events may not be in chronological order.  The log file can be very large (up to 1GB).  There might be duplicate log entries.

**Output:**

Your program should output a string representing the status of each transaction.  Each line in the output should be formatted as:

`TransactionID,Status`

Where:

*   `TransactionID`: The unique identifier for the transaction.
*   `Status`: A string indicating the status of the transaction. Possible statuses are:
    *   `COMMITTED`: The transaction was successfully committed according to 2PC.  This requires a `COORDINATOR_COMMIT`, and all participating services must have `PREPARE` and `COMMIT` events.  A service must not have an `ABORT` event.
    *   `ABORTED`: The transaction was aborted.  This can happen if a `COORDINATOR_ABORT` event is present, or if any participating service has an `ABORT` event *before* a `COORDINATOR_COMMIT` event.
    *   `INCONSISTENT`: The transaction is inconsistent and violates the 2PC protocol. This can occur in several ways:
        *   A transaction committed without all participating services having sent a `PREPARE`.
        *   A transaction committed but some participating services aborted.
        *   A transaction aborted but some participating services committed.
        *   The coordinator issued both `COORDINATOR_COMMIT` and `COORDINATOR_ABORT` for the same transaction.
        *   No `COORDINATOR_COMMIT` or `COORDINATOR_ABORT` event is present, but some services committed, and some aborted.

The output should be sorted alphabetically by `TransactionID`. If a transaction appears multiple times with different statuses due to conflicting information, the final status should be `INCONSISTENT`.

**Constraints:**

*   The log file can be up to 1 GB in size.
*   The number of transactions in the log file can be very large (e.g., millions).
*   The number of services participating in a single transaction can vary.
*   The log events may be out of order.
*   The log file may contain duplicate log entries for the same event.
*   The input log data is guaranteed to be well-formed, that is, it follows the specified format. However, the data may not be logically consistent.
*   Efficiency is critical. The solution should be able to process the log file in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., within a few minutes). Memory usage should also be considered.

**Example:**

**Input Log File:**

```
Tx123,ServiceA,PREPARE,1678886400
Tx123,ServiceB,PREPARE,1678886405
Tx123,ServiceA,COMMIT,1678886410
Tx123,ServiceB,COMMIT,1678886415
Tx123,Coordinator,COORDINATOR_COMMIT,1678886420
Tx456,ServiceC,PREPARE,1678886425
Tx456,ServiceD,ABORT,1678886430
Tx456,Coordinator,COORDINATOR_ABORT,1678886435
Tx789,ServiceE,PREPARE,1678886440
Tx789,ServiceF,COMMIT,1678886445
Tx789,ServiceE,COMMIT,1678886450
Tx123,ServiceA,PREPARE,1678886400
Tx456,ServiceC,PREPARE,1678886425
```

**Output:**

```
Tx123,COMMITTED
Tx456,ABORTED
Tx789,INCONSISTENT
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  The solution must correctly determine the status of each transaction according to the 2PC protocol rules.
*   **Efficiency:**  The solution must process the log file efficiently, both in terms of time and memory.  Solutions that are excessively slow or consume too much memory will be penalized.
*   **Code Quality:**  The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires careful parsing, data structure selection, and algorithmic design to achieve the required performance and correctness. Good luck!

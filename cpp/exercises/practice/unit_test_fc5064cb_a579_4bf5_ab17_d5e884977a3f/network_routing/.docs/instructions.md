Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem, designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard problem.

## Project Name

`NetworkRouting`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a highly efficient routing algorithm for a distributed network consisting of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. The network's topology is dynamic, meaning that connections between nodes can appear and disappear over time. Each node has a limited processing capacity and can only handle a certain number of routing requests concurrently.

The network is represented as follows:

*   **Nodes:** A set of `N` nodes, each with a unique ID.
*   **Edges:** A set of weighted, undirected edges connecting pairs of nodes. The weight of an edge represents the latency of communication between the connected nodes. The edges can change over time, being added or removed.
*   **Node Capacity:** Each node `i` has a capacity `C[i]`, representing the maximum number of concurrent routing requests it can handle.
*   **Routing Requests:** A stream of routing requests arrives. Each request consists of a source node `src`, a destination node `dest`, and a timestamp `t`.

Your task is to implement a routing algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path (minimum latency) between the source and destination nodes for each routing request, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Dynamic Topology:** The network topology changes over time. You need to efficiently handle edge additions and removals.
2.  **Node Capacity:**  A node can only participate in routing as many requests as its capacity allows. If a node is already at its capacity, it cannot be included in any new route.  Consider a path 'P' from `src` to `dest`. Each node in path `P` will be used in routing. Therefore, each node in `P` should have its capacity available.
3.  **Real-time Routing:** The routing algorithm needs to provide a path as quickly as possible upon receiving a routing request. You should strive to minimize the time it takes to find a path, considering the network's size and dynamicity.
4.  **Shortest Path:** the returned path should be the shortest path from `src` to `dest`. If there are multiple shortest paths, you can return any of them.

**Input:**

You are given the following input:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 10^5).
*   `C`: An array of integers of size `N`, where `C[i]` represents the capacity of node `i` (1 <= C[i] <= 100).
*   A sequence of operations, each represented as a string. The operations can be one of the following types:
    *   `"ADD e u v w t"`: Adds an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w` at time `t` (0 <= u, v < N, 1 <= w <= 1000, 0 <= t <= 10^9).  If the edge already exists, update its weight and timestamp.
    *   `"REMOVE e u v t"`: Removes the edge between nodes `u` and `v` at time `t` (0 <= u, v < N, 0 <= t <= 10^9). If the edge does not exist, do nothing.
    *   `"ROUTE r src dest t"`:  Processes a routing request from node `src` to node `dest` at time `t` (0 <= src, dest < N, 0 <= t <= 10^9).

**Output:**

For each `"ROUTE"` operation, your algorithm should output:

*   If a path is found that satisfies the node capacity constraints, output a space-separated list of node IDs representing the shortest path from `src` to `dest`. The path should start with `src` and end with `dest`.
*   If no path is found that satisfies the node capacity constraints, output `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes `N` is at most 10^5.
*   The number of operations (ADD, REMOVE, ROUTE) is at most 10^5.
*   The time `t` for each operation is non-decreasing. This allows for efficient caching or time-based data structures.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Multiple edges between two nodes are not allowed at the same time `t`.

**Example:**

```
Input:
5
1 1 1 1 1
ADD e 0 1 10 0
ADD e 1 2 5 1
ADD e 2 3 5 2
ADD e 3 4 10 3
ROUTE r 0 4 4
REMOVE e 2 3 5 5
ROUTE r 0 4 6
ROUTE r 0 4 7
```

```
Output:
0 1 2 3 4
-1
-1
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `ROUTE` request at time 4 finds the path `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`. All nodes have capacity 1 and are available, so the path is output.
2.  The `REMOVE` operation removes the edge between nodes 2 and 3 at time 5.
3.  The second and third `ROUTE` requests at times 6 and 7 cannot find a valid path because the graph is disconnected (no path between 2 and 3).

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:** The ability to find the shortest path while adhering to the node capacity constraints.
*   **Efficiency:** The time complexity of the routing algorithm, especially with respect to handling dynamic topology changes and real-time routing requests. Solutions with better time complexity will be favored.
*   **Code Quality:** The clarity, structure, and maintainability of the code.

**Hint:**

Consider using a combination of data structures and algorithms, such as:

*   A graph representation that allows for efficient edge additions and removals (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix).
*   A shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search) with modifications to consider node capacity constraints.
*   A data structure to track node capacities and their availability.
*   Consider how to implement edge removals efficiently.  Naively recomputing the graph on every removal will likely lead to TLE.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithms to achieve optimal performance and is designed to be challenging for even experienced programmers. Good luck!

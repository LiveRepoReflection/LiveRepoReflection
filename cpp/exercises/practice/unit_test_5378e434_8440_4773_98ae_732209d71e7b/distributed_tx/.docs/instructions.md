Okay, here's a challenging C++ problem description.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator. Imagine a system where multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.), called *participants*, need to perform operations that must either all succeed or all fail. To achieve this, you'll implement a coordinator that orchestrates a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**System Model:**

*   **Participants:** Each participant is a black box that can perform a local operation. It has the ability to prepare to commit (promise it *can* commit) and then either commit or rollback the operation. Participants communicate only with the coordinator. We simulate a participant with a simplified interface: it can receive 'prepare', 'commit', and 'rollback' commands from the coordinator and return a boolean indicating success or failure.
*   **Coordinator:** Your code will implement the coordinator. The coordinator receives a transaction request containing a list of participants. It then executes the 2PC protocol.
*   **Network:** Assume a partially synchronous network. Messages can be delayed, but are not lost or corrupted.
*   **Failure Model:** Participants can fail at any point. The coordinator is assumed to be reliable (no crash recovery needed for this problem).

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **`Participant` Class/Interface:**  Define a `Participant` class/interface with the following method:

    *   `bool execute(std::string operation);` : Simulates an operation on the participant. It should return `true` for success and `false` for failure.
    *   `bool prepare();`: The participant attempts to prepare for the transaction. If it can commit (e.g., it has reserved resources), it returns `true`. If it cannot (e.g., resources are unavailable, the operation would violate constraints), it returns `false`. Once a participant returns `true` for prepare, it *must* eventually be able to commit or rollback.
    *   `bool commit();`:  The participant commits the transaction. It should return `true` if successful.
    *   `bool rollback();`: The participant rolls back the transaction. It should return `true` if successful.
        * For simplicity, assume if `execute` fails, all the prepare, commit, and rollback will also fail.

2.  **`Coordinator` Class:** Implement a `Coordinator` class with the following method:

    *   `bool executeTransaction(std::vector<Participant*> participants, std::string operation);`: This is the main entry point. It takes a vector of `Participant` pointers and the operation being executed.  It must implement the 2PC protocol as follows:

        *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):**
            *   The coordinator sends a "prepare" message to all participants.
            *   The coordinator waits for a response from all participants.
            *   If *all* participants respond with "yes" (prepared successfully), the coordinator proceeds to Phase 2.
            *   If *any* participant responds with "no" (failed to prepare), or the coordinator times out waiting for a response from a participant, the coordinator proceeds to the rollback phase (see below).  Define a reasonable timeout value.
        *   **Phase 2 (Commit or Rollback Phase):**
            *   **Commit:** If all participants prepared successfully, the coordinator sends a "commit" message to all participants.
                *   The coordinator waits for acknowledgements. If all commit operations succeed, `executeTransaction` should return `true`.
                *   If any commit operation fails or the coordinator times out, the coordinator should attempt to rollback all participants (see rollback below).
            *   **Rollback:** If any participant failed to prepare (or commit), the coordinator sends a "rollback" message to all participants.
                *   The coordinator waits for acknowledgements. If all rollback operations succeed, `executeTransaction` should return `false`.
                *   If any rollback operation fails or the coordinator times out, the coordinator should log the failure (to `std::cerr`) and continue attempting to rollback the remaining participants. The `executeTransaction` function should *still* return `false` in this case.  The goal is to ensure that as many participants as possible are rolled back to maintain data consistency, even if some fail.

3.  **Error Handling:**

    *   Implement appropriate error handling.  Consider cases where participants fail to respond or fail during commit/rollback.
    *   Log any failures to `std::cerr` with descriptive messages.  Include the participant's ID (e.g., its index in the `participants` vector) in the log message.

4.  **Concurrency (Important):**

    *   The coordinator must handle the prepare, commit, and rollback phases concurrently. Use `std::thread` to send messages to participants in parallel and wait for their responses. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`, `std::future`) to manage the concurrent operations and ensure data consistency.  Avoid race conditions.

5.  **Optimization:** Minimize the total execution time of the transaction. Sending messages concurrently is a key optimization.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of participants can range from 1 to 100.
*   The timeout value for waiting for participant responses should be reasonable (e.g., 100ms to 1 second).
*   The `executeTransaction` function must return in a reasonable amount of time, even if some participants fail (e.g., within a few seconds).  The rollback should be as aggressive as possible, even if it means continuing despite failures.
*   You can simulate participant failure by having the `prepare`, `commit`, or `rollback` methods randomly return `false` with a small probability (e.g., 5%).

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the coordinator correctly implement the 2PC protocol? Does it ensure atomicity (all or nothing)?
*   **Error Handling:** Does the coordinator handle participant failures gracefully? Does it log errors appropriately?
*   **Concurrency:** Does the coordinator use concurrency to improve performance? Is the code thread-safe?
*   **Performance:** How quickly does the coordinator complete transactions, especially with a large number of participants?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. Good luck!

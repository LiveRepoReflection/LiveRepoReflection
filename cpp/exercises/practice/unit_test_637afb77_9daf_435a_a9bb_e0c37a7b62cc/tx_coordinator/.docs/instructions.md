Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging C++ coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a simplified version of a distributed transaction coordinator. In a distributed system, transactions might span multiple services or databases.  To ensure data consistency across these services, we need a mechanism to either commit all changes or roll back all changes in case of a failure. This is where a transaction coordinator comes in.

Your system will simulate a distributed environment with `N` participant services (where `N` is a given integer). Each participant service can either successfully prepare a transaction, commit a transaction, or roll back a transaction. The coordinator is responsible for orchestrating these services to ensure atomicity (all or nothing).

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionality:

1.  **Initialization:** The coordinator should be initialized with a list of `N` participant service addresses (represented as strings). You do not need to actually connect to a real service; simply store these addresses.

2.  **Start Transaction:** When a new transaction starts, the coordinator must initiate a "prepare" phase with each participant. Each participant, upon receiving the "prepare" request, will simulate preparing the transaction (e.g., writing to a temporary log). The participant will respond to the coordinator with either "prepared" (success) or "abort" (failure).

3.  **Commit or Rollback:**
    *   If *all* participants respond with "prepared", the coordinator must then send a "commit" request to all participants.
    *   If *any* participant responds with "abort", or if the coordinator times out waiting for a response from any participant (see Constraints below), the coordinator must send a "rollback" request to all participants.
    *   Participants *must* respond to the final commit or rollback message.

4.  **Simulate Participant Behavior:** Each participant service is represented by a function that you can call with a command ("prepare", "commit", "rollback"). This function will simulate the service's behavior and return a result ("prepared", "abort", "committed", "rolled back"). The function can also simulate service failures (e.g., by returning an error or taking a very long time to respond).

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The coordinator should handle the following failure scenarios:
    *   **Participant Timeout:** If a participant does not respond to a "prepare" request within a specified timeout (in milliseconds), the coordinator must treat the participant as having aborted the transaction and initiate a rollback.
    *   **Coordinator Failure:** Assume the coordinator can fail *after* sending the "prepare" messages but *before* sending the "commit" or "rollback" messages. In this case, each participant must independently decide whether to commit or abort. Each participant must implement the following rule: If it hasn't received a "commit" or "rollback" within a specified timeout (in milliseconds) *after* sending "prepared", it should assume the coordinator failed and *abort* the transaction.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of participant services.
*   `service_addresses`: A vector of strings, where each string is a unique identifier for a participant service.
*   `participant_behavior`: A vector of function pointers or function objects. Each `participant_behavior[i]` represents the behavior of the service at `service_addresses[i]`. It takes a string command ("prepare", "commit", "rollback") and returns a string result ("prepared", "abort", "committed", "rolled back").
*   `prepare_timeout_ms`: The timeout (in milliseconds) for the coordinator to wait for "prepare" responses.
*   `completion_timeout_ms`: The timeout (in milliseconds) for a participant to wait for a "commit" or "rollback" after sending "prepared".

**Output:**

*   A boolean value: `true` if the transaction was successfully committed across all participants, `false` otherwise (if any participant aborted the transaction).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `1 <= service_addresses.size() <= 100`
*   `1 <= prepare_timeout_ms <= 5000` (milliseconds)
*   `1 <= completion_timeout_ms <= 10000` (milliseconds)
*   Your solution must be thread-safe.  Multiple transactions might be initiated concurrently.
*   Minimize the time complexity of your solution. Inefficient solutions might time out.
*   The `participant_behavior` functions are external and cannot be modified. You can only interact with them by calling them with the specified commands.
*   You are free to use any standard C++ library.

**Example:**

(This is a simplified example, the actual testing will involve more complex scenarios and failures)

```c++
// Assume a simple participant behavior that always prepares and commits.
std::string simple_participant(const std::string& command) {
  if (command == "prepare") {
    return "prepared";
  } else if (command == "commit") {
    return "committed";
  } else {
    return "rolled back";
  }
}

int main() {
  int N = 3;
  std::vector<std::string> service_addresses = {"service1", "service2", "service3"};
  std::vector<std::function<std::string(const std::string&)>> participant_behavior = {
    simple_participant, simple_participant, simple_participant
  };
  int prepare_timeout_ms = 1000;
  int completion_timeout_ms = 2000;

  // Call your transaction coordinator here.
  bool result = coordinate_transaction(N, service_addresses, participant_behavior, prepare_timeout_ms, completion_timeout_ms);

  // In this simple case, the transaction should commit.
  std::cout << "Transaction committed: " << result << std::endl; // Expected: Transaction committed: 1
  return 0;
}
```

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:**  Does it correctly implement the distributed transaction protocol and handle all success and failure scenarios?
*   **Concurrency:** Is it thread-safe and able to handle concurrent transactions?
*   **Performance:** Does it complete within the time limits? (Inefficient solutions will time out.)
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling in C++. Good luck!

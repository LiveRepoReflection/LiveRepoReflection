Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed with a focus on algorithmic efficiency, advanced data structures, and real-world considerations.

**Problem Title:** Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a task scheduling system for a high-performance computing cluster.  There are `n` tasks to be executed. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id[i]`: A unique integer identifier for the task (1 <= `id[i]` <= n).
*   `execution_time[i]`: The time (in seconds) required to execute the task.
*   `deadline[i]`: The deadline (in seconds from the start of the scheduling window) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start. A task can have zero or more dependencies.  Dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   `priority[i]`: An integer representing the priority of the task. Higher values indicate higher priority.

The cluster has `k` identical machines that can execute tasks in parallel.  Each machine can execute only one task at a time.

Your goal is to design an algorithm to schedule these tasks on the `k` machines such that:

1.  **All tasks are completed.**
2.  **All dependencies are satisfied.**  A task can only start execution after all its dependencies are completed.
3.  **All deadlines are met.**  Each task must complete its execution before its deadline.
4.  **The total *weighted tardiness* is minimized.**  The weighted tardiness of a task `i` is defined as:

    *   `0` if `completion_time[i]` <= `deadline[i]` (task is completed on time)
    *   `priority[i] * (completion_time[i] - deadline[i])` if `completion_time[i]` > `deadline[i]` (task is late)

    The total weighted tardiness is the sum of the weighted tardiness of all tasks.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   `n`: The number of tasks (1 <= `n` <= 100,000).
*   `k`: The number of machines in the cluster (1 <= `k` <= 100).
*   A list of `n` tasks, where each task is defined by the following:

    *   `id[i]`
    *   `execution_time[i]` (1 <= `execution_time[i]` <= 10,000)
    *   `deadline[i]` (1 <= `deadline[i]` <= 1,000,000)
    *   `dependencies[i]` (a list of task IDs). The sum of all dependencies across all tasks will not exceed 200,000
    *   `priority[i]` (1 <= `priority[i]` <= 100)

**Output:**

Your program should output the minimum possible total weighted tardiness.  If it is impossible to schedule all tasks such that all dependencies and deadlines are met, output `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   The dependencies form a valid DAG (no cycles).
*   Task IDs are unique and in the range [1, n].
*   All input values are non-negative integers.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient to handle large input sizes. Inefficient solutions will time out.

**Example:**

```
n = 4, k = 2
Task 1: id=1, execution_time=5, deadline=10, dependencies=[], priority=1
Task 2: id=2, execution_time=3, deadline=12, dependencies=[1], priority=2
Task 3: id=3, execution_time=4, deadline=15, dependencies=[1], priority=3
Task 4: id=4, execution_time=2, deadline=20, dependencies=[2, 3], priority=4
```

One possible schedule:

*   Machine 1: Task 1 (0-5), Task 4 (8-10)
*   Machine 2: Task 2 (5-8), Task 3 (5-9)

Completion times: Task 1: 5, Task 2: 8, Task 3: 9, Task 4: 10

Weighted tardiness: Task 1: 0, Task 2: 0, Task 3: 0, Task 4: 0

Total weighted tardiness: 0

Another possible schedule:

*   Machine 1: Task 1 (0-5), Task 2 (5-8)
*   Machine 2: Task 3 (0-4), Task 4 (8-10)

Completion times: Task 1: 5, Task 2: 8, Task 3: 4, Task 4: 10

Weighted tardiness: Task 1: 0, Task 2: 0, Task 3: 0, Task 4: 0

Total weighted tardiness: 0

```
n = 3, k = 1
Task 1: id=1, execution_time=5, deadline=7, dependencies=[], priority=10
Task 2: id=2, execution_time=4, deadline=8, dependencies=[1], priority=5
Task 3: id=3, execution_time=6, deadline=10, dependencies=[2], priority=1
```

One possible schedule:

*   Machine 1: Task 1 (0-5), Task 2 (5-9), Task 3 (9-15)

Completion times: Task 1: 5, Task 2: 9, Task 3: 15

Weighted tardiness: Task 1: 0, Task 2: 5, Task 3: 5

Total weighted tardiness: 10

Another possible schedule:
*   Machine 1: Task 1 (0-5), Task 3 (5-11), Task 2 (11-15)
Completion times: Task 1: 5, Task 3: 11, Task 2: 15
Weighted tardiness: Task 1: 0, Task 3: 1, Task 2: 35
Total weighted tardiness: 36

The output is `10`

**Notes:**

*   This problem requires careful consideration of task dependencies, deadlines, priorities, and machine availability.
*   Efficient algorithms, possibly involving heuristics and dynamic programming, are needed to find the optimal solution within the time constraints.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures to represent the task dependencies and machine schedules.
*   Solutions that explore all possible task permutations are likely to time out for larger input sizes.

Good luck!

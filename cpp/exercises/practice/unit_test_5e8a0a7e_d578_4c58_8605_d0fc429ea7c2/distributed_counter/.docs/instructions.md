`DistributedConsistentCounter`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed, eventually consistent counter service. This service should allow multiple clients to increment a shared counter, even when network partitions occur. The system must tolerate node failures, network instability, and ensure that increments are eventually reflected in the final counter value.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Increment Operation:** Clients can send an `Increment(value)` request to any available server instance. The `value` is an integer representing the amount to increment the counter.
2.  **Eventual Consistency:** Due to network partitions and potential node failures, immediate consistency is not required. The counter value seen by different clients may diverge temporarily. However, the system must guarantee that all increments will eventually be reflected in the final counter value.
3.  **Conflict Resolution:**  Increments can happen concurrently on different servers. The system needs a mechanism to resolve conflicts and ensure that no increments are lost.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should tolerate node failures. If a server instance fails, the service should continue to operate, and the data should be recoverable.
5.  **Scalability:** While not a primary focus for this problem, consider how your design could be scaled horizontally to handle a large number of clients and high increment rates.
6.  **Read Operation:** Clients can query the current value of the counter using a `GetCount()` request. The returned value should reflect the best-known counter value at the time of the request. Note that due to eventual consistency, the value might not be perfectly up-to-date. Minimize the latency of the read operation as much as possible.
7.  **Concurrency:** Servers must handle concurrent increment requests efficiently.

**Constraints:**

*   The counter should be implemented using a distributed architecture. Assume you have a cluster of server instances that can communicate with each other (when the network allows).
*   You may use any reasonable data structure or algorithm to implement the counter, but you must justify your choices.
*   Consider the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and fault tolerance when designing your solution (CAP theorem).
*   Assume the `value` in the `Increment(value)` request can be positive or negative, but the total count should never be wrapped (overflow).
*   The number of server instances is fixed.
*   Minimize the amount of data transfer for each operations.
*   Make sure to handle the edge cases. e.g., empty state, concurrent write, network partition and etc.
*   The increment value can be zero, but the server should still record the request.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to detect and resolve conflicts between concurrent increments.
*   Design a strategy for handling network partitions and ensuring that data is eventually synchronized.
*   Implement data persistence to survive server restarts.
*   Provide a brief analysis of the time complexity and space complexity of your solution.
*   Identify and discuss the key trade-offs in your design.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. It encourages the use of advanced data structures and algorithms to achieve a robust and scalable solution. Good luck!

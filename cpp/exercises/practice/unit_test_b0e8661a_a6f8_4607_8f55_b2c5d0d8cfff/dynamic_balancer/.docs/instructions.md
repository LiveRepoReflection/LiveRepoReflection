## Question: Distributed Load Balancer with Dynamic Sharding

**Problem Description:**

Design and implement a distributed load balancer that efficiently distributes incoming requests across a cluster of backend servers. This load balancer must support dynamic sharding based on request content and adapt to changes in the backend server pool in real time without service interruption.

**System Architecture:**

The system consists of the following components:

1.  **Load Balancer Nodes:** Multiple load balancer instances are deployed to handle incoming client requests. Each load balancer node is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate backend server.

2.  **Backend Servers:** A cluster of backend servers that process the actual client requests. Servers can be added or removed dynamically.

3.  **Metadata Store:** A central, highly available store (e.g., etcd, ZooKeeper, Consul) that maintains the current state of the system, including:

    *   The list of active backend servers and their capabilities (e.g., supported data types, processing capacity).
    *   The sharding rules, which map request attributes to specific backend server groups.
    *   The health status of each backend server.

**Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Request Routing:** The load balancer must route incoming requests to the appropriate backend server based on the sharding rules. Sharding should be content-based, using a configurable attribute (e.g., a customer ID, a product category, a geographic location) extracted from the request payload.

2.  **Dynamic Sharding:** The sharding rules can be updated in real time without restarting the load balancer or backend servers. Changes to the sharding rules must be propagated to all load balancer nodes consistently and efficiently.

3.  **Backend Server Management:** Backend servers can be added or removed from the cluster dynamically. The load balancer must automatically detect these changes and adjust its routing behavior accordingly.

4.  **Health Monitoring:** The load balancer must continuously monitor the health of the backend servers. Unhealthy servers should be automatically removed from the routing pool, and requests should be redirected to healthy servers.

5.  **Load Balancing:** Within each shard (group of servers), the load balancer must distribute requests evenly among the healthy backend servers. Implement a suitable load balancing algorithm (e.g., Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, Least Connections).

6.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to failures. If a load balancer node fails, other nodes should be able to take over its responsibilities. If a backend server fails, requests should be automatically rerouted to other healthy servers in the same shard. The Metadata store should also be highly available.

7.  **Configuration:** The load balancer should be configurable through an external configuration file or API. Configuration parameters should include:
    * Sharding key
    * Sharding function (e.g., consistent hashing, modulo)
    * Health check interval
    * Load balancing algorithm

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests and scale horizontally by adding more load balancer nodes and backend servers.

2.  **Low Latency:** The routing decision must be made quickly to minimize request latency.

3.  **High Availability:** The system must be highly available and provide continuous service, even in the presence of failures.

4.  **Consistency:** Changes to the sharding rules and backend server pool must be propagated to all load balancer nodes consistently to ensure correct routing behavior.

5.  **Efficiency:** The system should make efficient use of resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).

**Input:**

*   A stream of incoming client requests. Each request contains a payload with the sharding attribute.
*   A dynamic list of backend servers, including their addresses and capabilities.
*   A set of sharding rules that map request attributes to backend server groups.

**Output:**

*   The load balancer must route each request to the appropriate backend server based on the sharding rules and the health status of the servers.
*   The system should log all routing decisions and any errors that occur.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of backend servers can be very large (e.g., thousands).
*   The sharding rules can be complex and change frequently.
*   The load balancer must handle a high volume of requests with low latency.
*   Memory usage of each load balancer node must be minimized.
*   The metadata store has limited write capacity.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The load balancer correctly routes requests to the appropriate backend servers based on the sharding rules and the health status of the servers.
*   **Scalability:** The system can handle a large number of concurrent requests and scale horizontally.
*   **Low Latency:** The routing decision is made quickly to minimize request latency.
*   **High Availability:** The system provides continuous service, even in the presence of failures.
*   **Efficiency:** The system makes efficient use of resources.
*   **Code Quality:** The code is well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   **Design Rationale:** The design is well-reasoned and addresses the key challenges of the problem.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. It also requires the ability to design a system that is scalable, reliable, and efficient. Consider carefully the data structures you use to store the routing information and how you manage the dynamic updates. The choice of sharding function and load balancing algorithm will also have a significant impact on the performance of the system.

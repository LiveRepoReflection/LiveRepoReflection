Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world applications.

**Project Name:** `SmartCityTrafficOptimization`

**Question Description:**

The city of "Algorithmia" is experiencing severe traffic congestion. As a brilliant algorithm engineer, you've been hired to optimize the city's traffic flow. Algorithmia can be modeled as a directed graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent intersections in the city. Each intersection `i` has a capacity `C[i]` representing the maximum number of cars that can pass through it per unit time.
*   **Edges:** Represent roads connecting intersections. Each road `(u, v)` has a length `L[u][v]` (representing travel time) and a capacity `R[u][v]` representing the maximum number of cars that can travel on it per unit time.

The city also has a set of `K` commuters. Each commuter `k` has:

*   A source intersection `S[k]`
*   A destination intersection `D[k]`
*   A traffic demand `T[k]` (number of cars wanting to travel from `S[k]` to `D[k]`)
*   A maximum acceptable travel time `A[k]`

Your goal is to determine if it's possible to route all commuters from their sources to their destinations while satisfying all the following constraints:

1.  **Intersection Capacity:** The total flow of cars passing through any intersection `i` must not exceed its capacity `C[i]`.
2.  **Road Capacity:** The flow of cars on any road `(u, v)` must not exceed its capacity `R[u][v]`.
3.  **Travel Time Constraint:** Each commuter `k` must reach their destination `D[k]` from `S[k]` within the maximum acceptable travel time `A[k]`.
4.  **Full Demand Satisfaction:** All traffic demand `T[k]` from all commuters must be satisfied.

If it is possible, output "Possible". Otherwise, output "Impossible".

**Input:**

*   `N`: Number of intersections (nodes)
*   `M`: Number of roads (edges)
*   `K`: Number of commuters

Followed by:

*   `C[N]`: Array of intersection capacities.
*   `U[M]`, `V[M]`, `L[M]`, `R[M]`:  Arrays representing the edges, where `U[i]` and `V[i]` are the source and destination intersections of the `i`-th road, `L[i]` is the length (travel time) of the `i`-th road, and `R[i]` is the capacity of the `i`-th road.
*   `S[K]`, `D[K]`, `T[K]`, `A[K]`: Arrays representing the commuters, where `S[i]` and `D[i]` are the source and destination intersections of the `i`-th commuter, `T[i]` is the traffic demand, and `A[i]` is the maximum acceptable travel time.
*   All arrays index are zero-based.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `N` <= 100
*   1 <= `M` <= 500
*   1 <= `K` <= 20
*   1 <= `C[i]` <= 1000
*   1 <= `L[i]` <= 100
*   1 <= `R[i]` <= 1000
*   1 <= `T[i]` <= 100
*   1 <= `A[i]` <= 10000

**Example:**

```
Input:
4 5 2
50 60 70 80
0 1 10 20
0 2 5 15
1 3 15 25
2 3 10 30
1 2 5 10
0 3 10 50 100
2 3 15 70

Output:
Possible
```

**Explanation:**

This is a simplified example, but it illustrates the core problem.  You need to find a flow assignment for each commuter that satisfies all the capacity and travel time constraints.  For example, commuter 0 can use the path 0 -> 1 -> 3. commuter 1 can use the path 2 -> 3.

**Scoring:**

*   Correctness:  The solution should correctly identify whether a feasible routing exists.
*   Efficiency: The solution should be able to handle large test cases within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.  Partial credit may be awarded for solutions that handle smaller or simpler test cases.

**Hints (Subtle):**

*   Consider using graph algorithms like shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) to determine travel times.
*   Think about network flow algorithms (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic's algorithm) to manage traffic flow.  However, the travel time constraint makes this a *constrained* network flow problem, which is significantly harder.
*   You might need to explore optimization techniques like binary search (on some parameter) or heuristics to find a feasible solution within the time limit.
*   Careful modeling of the problem is crucial. Think about how to represent the constraints within your chosen algorithms.
*   Integer programming solvers could potentially be used but might be overkill and harder to implement efficiently in a contest setting.

Good luck!

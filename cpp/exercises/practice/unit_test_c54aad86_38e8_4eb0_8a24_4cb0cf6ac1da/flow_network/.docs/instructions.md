## Question: Multi-Commodity Flow Network Design

**Description:**

You are designing a network for transporting multiple commodities between various source and destination pairs. The network consists of nodes connected by directed edges. Each edge has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of flow (summed across all commodities) that can pass through it. The goal is to determine the optimal edge capacities to minimize the total cost of the network while satisfying all the demand for each commodity.

**Specifically:**

*   You are given a set of nodes `N` and a set of potential directed edges `E`.
*   Each edge `(u, v)` in `E` has an associated cost per unit capacity `c(u, v)`.
*   You are given a set of commodities `K`. Each commodity `k` has a source node `s(k)`, a destination node `t(k)`, and a demand `d(k)`.

**Task:**

Determine the capacity `cap(u, v)` for each edge `(u, v)` in `E` such that:

1.  The total cost of the network is minimized:  `Minimize:  Î£ c(u, v) * cap(u, v)`  for all `(u, v)` in `E`.
2.  The flow for each commodity `k` from `s(k)` to `t(k)` is equal to `d(k)`.
3.  The total flow through any edge `(u, v)` (summed across all commodities) does not exceed the edge's capacity `cap(u, v)`.
4.  Edge capacities must be non-negative.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of nodes. Nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `E`: A list of tuples `(u, v, c)`, where `u` and `v` are integers representing the source and destination nodes of the edge, and `c` is a double representing the cost per unit capacity of the edge.
*   `K`: A list of tuples `(s, t, d)`, where `s` and `t` are integers representing the source and destination nodes of the commodity, and `d` is a double representing the demand of the commodity.

**Output:**

Return a list of tuples `(u, v, cap)`, where `u` and `v` are the source and destination nodes of the edge, and `cap` is a double representing the optimal capacity for that edge. If no feasible solution exists (i.e., it is impossible to satisfy all demands given the network structure), return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 100
*   1 <= |E| <= 500  (where |E| is the number of edges)
*   1 <= |K| <= 100  (where |K| is the number of commodities)
*   0 <= u, v, s, t < N
*   0.001 <= c <= 100.0
*   0.001 <= d <= 100.0
*   The solution should be accurate to within a tolerance of 1e-6 for capacity values.
*   The network may not be fully connected.
*   Multiple commodities can share the same source and/or destination.
*   There may be multiple edges between the same two nodes (in the same or opposite directions).
*   Self-loops (edges where u == v) are not allowed.
*   The graph is directed.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
E = [(0, 1, 1.0), (0, 2, 2.0), (1, 2, 1.0), (1, 3, 3.0), (2, 3, 1.0)]
K = [(0, 3, 2.0)]

Output (one possible solution):
[(0, 1, 2.0), (0, 2, 0.0), (1, 2, 0.0), (1, 3, 2.0), (2, 3, 0.0)]
```

```
N = 2
E = [(0, 1, 1.0)]
K = [(0, 1, 5.0), (0, 1, 5.0)]

Output (one possible solution):
[(0, 1, 10.0)]
```

```
N = 2
E = [(0, 1, 1.0)]
K = [(0, 1, 5.0), (1, 0, 5.0)]

Output (one possible solution):
[]
```

**Grading:**

The solution will be judged based on:

*   Correctness (satisfying all demands and capacity constraints).
*   Cost optimality (achieving the minimum possible total cost).
*   Efficiency (handling larger inputs within a reasonable time limit).
*   Handling edge cases.

**Note:** This problem requires knowledge of network flow algorithms and potentially linear programming or convex optimization techniques. Efficient implementation and careful consideration of edge cases are crucial for success.

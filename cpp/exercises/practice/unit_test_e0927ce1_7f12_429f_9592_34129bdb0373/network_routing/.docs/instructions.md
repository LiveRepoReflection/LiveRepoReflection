## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing algorithm for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, each uniquely identified by an integer from `0` to `N-1`. The network's topology is defined by a set of bidirectional connections between nodes, each with an associated latency cost.  Your goal is to minimize the maximum latency experienced by any message traversing the network, given a set of communication requests.

Specifically, you are given:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `connections`: A vector of tuples `(u, v, latency)`, representing bidirectional connections between node `u` and node `v` with a latency of `latency`.
*   `requests`: A vector of tuples `(source, destination)`, representing communication requests. Each request requires a message to be sent from `source` to `destination`.

Your task is to design an algorithm that finds a path for each request such that the maximum latency of any individual path among all requests is minimized. The path for each request must be a simple path (no repeated nodes).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `1 <= latency <= 100`
*   `1 <= number of connections <= N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   `1 <= number of requests <= 1000`
*   It is guaranteed that there is at least one path exists for each request.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   The latency is an integer.

**Input:**

The input should be provided as function arguments: `N`, `connections`, and `requests`.

**Output:**

The function should return an integer representing the minimum possible maximum latency among all requests. This is the minimum value `max_latency` such that every request can have a path with a latency of at most `max_latency`.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the maximum input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Consider algorithmic complexity and potential optimizations. A naive solution that explores all possible paths for each request will likely time out.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Consider cases where the graph is sparse or dense.
*   Consider cases with a large number of requests.
*   Consider cases where some nodes are isolated (although a valid path is guaranteed for each request).
*   Consider cases with duplicate connections between the same two nodes (handle the minimum latency).

**Optimization Hints:**

*   Consider using efficient graph algorithms for pathfinding.
*   Think about using binary search to find the optimal `max_latency`.
*   Consider how to handle the constraints efficiently during the search process.
*   Pre-computation of useful data might be beneficial.
*   Be mindful of memory usage.

This problem requires careful consideration of algorithmic choices, data structures, and optimization techniques to achieve the required efficiency and handle the various constraints and edge cases. Good luck!

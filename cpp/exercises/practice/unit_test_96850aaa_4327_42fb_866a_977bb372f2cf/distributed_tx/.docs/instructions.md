## Question: Distributed Transaction Simulation

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with simulating a distributed transaction system across a network of `n` nodes (numbered from 0 to n-1). Each node stores a certain quantity of a digital asset. Transactions involve transferring assets between nodes. However, due to the distributed nature, transactions must adhere to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). You need to implement a system that simulates these transactions, focusing on concurrency and failure scenarios.

**System Model:**

1.  **Nodes:** Each node `i` has an initial asset quantity `a[i]` (non-negative integer). Nodes communicate via messages.

2.  **Transactions:** A transaction `T` involves a set of transfers: `(source_node, destination_node, amount)`. A transaction either commits successfully, transferring assets from all source nodes to their respective destination nodes, or aborts, leaving the system in its original state.

3.  **Concurrency:** Multiple transactions can run concurrently. You need to handle potential conflicts and ensure data consistency. Implement a 2-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol for concurrency control.

4.  **Network Partitions:** The network might experience partitions, where nodes become temporarily isolated from each other. When a partition occurs, a transaction that involves nodes in different partitions may be blocked or need to be aborted after a timeout (defined below).

5.  **Node Failures:** Nodes can fail during any phase of the transaction. You need to handle node failures and ensure that the transaction either completes or is rolled back consistently.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following:

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= `n` <= 1000).
*   `a`: An array of `n` non-negative integers representing the initial asset quantity at each node.
*   `transactions`: A list of transactions. Each transaction is a list of transfers: `(source_node, destination_node, amount)`.
*   `partitions`: A list of network partition events. Each partition event is a tuple: `(start_time, end_time, affected_nodes)`. `start_time` and `end_time` represent the time interval during which the partition is active. `affected_nodes` is a list of node IDs that are isolated in the partition. Nodes not in `affected_nodes` are still connected. Assume time is discrete and starts from 0.
*   `failure_events`: A list of node failure events. Each failure event is a tuple: `(time, node_id)`. The node recovers after a long, unknown amount of time.
*   `timeout`: An integer representing the transaction timeout in time units. If a transaction does not complete within the timeout, it should be aborted.

**Output:**

Return an array of `n` non-negative integers representing the final asset quantity at each node after processing all transactions, partitions, and failures.

**Constraints:**

*   0 <= `a[i]` <= 10<sup>6</sup>
*   0 <= `source_node`, `destination_node` < `n`
*   0 <= `amount` <= 10<sup>6</sup>
*   0 <= `start_time` < `end_time` <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   0 <= `time` <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   The sum of all transfer amounts in a single transaction will not exceed 10<sup>9</sup>.
*   Multiple transactions can involve the same node.
*   Transactions are submitted sequentially but execute concurrently.
*   If a node fails, it loses all in-memory state related to ongoing transactions.  The asset quantity on disk is preserved.
*   Assume nodes are initially connected (no partitions at time 0).
*   The simulation runs for a fixed amount of time, sufficient to execute all transactions.
*   Assume all timestamps and amounts are integers.

**Requirements:**

1.  Implement a 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity and consistency.  The coordinator for each transaction can be arbitrarily chosen (e.g., the lowest node ID involved in the transaction).
2.  Handle concurrent transactions correctly, preventing race conditions and ensuring isolation. Consider using locking mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) on node resources.
3.  Simulate network partitions. Transactions involving nodes in different partitions should either be blocked or aborted after the timeout.
4.  Simulate node failures. Handle transaction rollback or completion consistently when a node fails.
5.  Implement a mechanism to track transaction timeouts.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Your solution must produce the correct final asset quantities for all nodes, adhering to the ACID properties.
*   Concurrency Handling: Your solution must correctly handle concurrent transactions without data corruption.
*   Fault Tolerance: Your solution must gracefully handle network partitions and node failures.
*   Efficiency: Your solution should be reasonably efficient, although the primary focus is on correctness and fault tolerance. Avoid unnecessary computations or data copies.
*   Code Clarity: Your code should be well-structured, readable, and well-commented.

This question requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. It requires careful consideration of edge cases and potential failure scenarios to ensure the system's reliability. Good luck!

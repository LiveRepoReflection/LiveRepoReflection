Okay, here's a challenging C++ problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focusing on efficiency, data structures, and edge case handling.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Validation**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a distributed database system. A crucial component of this system is the transaction validation service.  This service needs to ensure that transactions, spread across multiple shards (database partitions), maintain data consistency.

Each shard maintains a local log of transactions applied to it.  A global transaction can involve modifications across multiple shards. To ensure atomicity and consistency, the system employs a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

Your task is to implement a highly efficient transaction validation algorithm that determines whether a given set of global transactions are valid, given the transaction logs from each shard.

**Input Format:**

The input consists of the following:

1.  `num_shards`: An integer representing the number of database shards in the system.
2.  For each shard `i` (from 0 to `num_shards - 1`):
    *   `shard_log[i]`: A vector of strings representing the transaction log for shard `i`.  Each string is a transaction ID (TID).  The order of the transactions in the log represents the order in which they were applied to the shard.
3.  `global_transactions`: A vector of vectors of strings. Each inner vector represents a global transaction. Each string within the inner vector is a tuple with shard ID and transaction ID: `shard_id:transaction_id`
For example: `[["0:T1", "1:T2"], ["0:T3", "2:T4"]]`. This means that global transaction 1 involves transaction `T1` on shard 0 and `T2` on shard 1, and global transaction 2 involves transaction `T3` on shard 0 and `T4` on shard 2.

**Output Format:**

Return a boolean value: `true` if all global transactions are valid, `false` otherwise.

**Validation Rules:**

A set of global transactions is considered valid if and only if all of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Atomicity:** All transactions belonging to a global transaction must be present in the shard logs of the respective shards.
2.  **Ordering Consistency:** For any two global transactions G1 and G2, if a shard S contains transactions from both G1 and G2, then the order of those transactions in the shard log of S must be consistent with the order in which G1 and G2 were initiated globally.  Assume the global transaction initiation order is given implicitly by the order of `global_transactions` in the input. That is, `global_transactions[i]` was initiated before `global_transactions[j]` if `i < j`.
3. **No Phantom Reads:** For any two global transactions G1 and G2, if G1 reads data modified by G2 in shard S, G2 must be committed before G1 in S. For simplicity, assume that each transaction T in shard S reads all data written by all the transactions before T in shard S.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_shards <= 100`
*   `1 <= shard_log[i].size() <= 1000` for each shard `i`
*   `1 <= global_transactions.size() <= 500`
*   `1 <= global_transactions[i].size() <= num_shards` for each global transaction `i`
*   Transaction IDs are unique within each shard (but can be the same across different shards).
*   Shard IDs are valid (i.e., between 0 and `num_shards - 1`).
*   The total number of transaction entries across all global transactions is at most 5000.
*   **Time Limit: 2 seconds**
*   **Memory Limit: 256 MB**

**Example:**

```
num_shards = 3
shard_log[0] = ["T1", "T3", "T5"]
shard_log[1] = ["T2", "T4"]
shard_log[2] = ["T6", "T8"]
global_transactions = [["0:T1", "1:T2"], ["0:T3", "1:T4", "2:T6"], ["0:T5", "2:T8"]]

Output: true
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Atomicity:** All transactions are present in the respective shard logs.
*   **Ordering Consistency:**
    *   Shard 0 contains transactions from global transactions 1, 2, and 3. The order in the log ("T1", "T3", "T5") matches the initiation order of the global transactions.
    *   Shard 1 contains transactions from global transactions 1 and 2. The order in the log ("T2", "T4") matches the initiation order of the global transactions.
    *   Shard 2 contains transactions from global transactions 2 and 3. The order in the log ("T6", "T8") matches the initiation order of the global transactions.
* **No Phantom Reads:** All transactions are consistent with read-write rules.

**Considerations:**

*   The solution should be optimized for speed.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., hash maps) for efficient lookups.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases and corner scenarios.
*   Think about how to efficiently check the ordering consistency constraint.
*   Consider potential lock contention issues in a real distributed system. While you don't need to simulate locks, you should think about how your algorithm could be adapted to work in a concurrent environment.

This problem requires careful algorithm design and efficient implementation to meet the time and memory constraints. Good luck!

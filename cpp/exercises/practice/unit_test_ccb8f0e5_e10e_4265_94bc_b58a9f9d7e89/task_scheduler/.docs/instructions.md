Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging coding problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Efficient Task Scheduling with Deadlines and Dependencies

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a task scheduling system for a high-performance computing cluster. There are `N` tasks to be executed. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id[i]`: A unique integer identifier for the task (1 <= `id[i]` <= N).
*   `duration[i]`: The time (in seconds) required to execute the task.
*   `deadline[i]`: The time (in seconds) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start.  An empty list indicates no dependencies.

Your goal is to determine the **minimum possible makespan** (total time to complete all tasks) while respecting all deadlines and dependencies. Tasks can be executed in parallel, but a task cannot start until all its dependencies are finished.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks (1 <= N <= 200).
*   `id`: An array of N unique task IDs.
*   `duration`: An array of N integers representing the duration of each task (1 <= `duration[i]` <= 1000).
*   `deadline`: An array of N integers representing the deadline of each task (1 <= `deadline[i]` <= 100000).
*   `dependencies`: A 2D array (list of lists) where `dependencies[i]` is a list of integers representing the IDs of tasks that must be completed before task `i` can start.  Each dependency `id` will appear exactly once in the `id` array.

**Output:**

*   The minimum possible makespan (an integer) to complete all tasks while respecting deadlines and dependencies.
*   If it is impossible to complete all tasks within their deadlines, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 200`
*   Task IDs are unique and range from 1 to N.
*   Durations are positive integers.
*   Deadlines are positive integers.
*   The dependency graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  There are no circular dependencies.
*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).

**Example:**

```
N = 3
id = [1, 2, 3]
duration = [10, 20, 30]
deadline = [50, 60, 70]
dependencies = [[], [1], [2]]
```

In this example, task 1 has no dependencies, task 2 depends on task 1, and task 3 depends on task 2. A possible schedule is:

*   Task 1 starts at time 0, finishes at time 10.
*   Task 2 starts at time 10, finishes at time 30.
*   Task 3 starts at time 30, finishes at time 60.

The makespan is 60, and all deadlines are met. This is the optimal solution.

**Challenge:**

*   The relatively small constraint on `N` might tempt solutions involving brute force or exploring many possible schedules. However, the efficiency requirement means you'll need to think carefully about how to prune the search space or leverage more efficient algorithms.
*   Consider the impact of different task ordering strategies.
*   Think about how to efficiently check if a given schedule meets all deadlines.
*   Consider using topological sort and dynamic programming for efficient computation.

Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed to test advanced data structure knowledge, algorithmic efficiency, and attention to edge cases, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

**Problem Title: Intergalactic Social Network Analysis**

**Problem Description:**

The Intergalactic Federation (IGF) maintains a massive social network connecting individuals across countless planets. The network is represented as a directed graph where each node represents an individual, and a directed edge from node A to node B indicates that individual A follows individual B's updates.  The IGF is interested in analyzing the influence and information flow within this network.

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system to efficiently answer several types of queries on this social network.  The network is dynamic; individuals can join, leave, follow, and unfollow each other.

Specifically, your system must support the following operations:

1.  **`add_user(user_id)`**: Adds a new user with the given `user_id` to the network.  If a user with the same `user_id` already exists, the operation should be ignored.

2.  **`remove_user(user_id)`**: Removes the user with the given `user_id` from the network.  All incoming and outgoing edges associated with this user must also be removed. If a user with the `user_id` does not exists, the operation should be ignored.

3.  **`follow(follower_id, followee_id)`**: Creates a directed edge from `follower_id` to `followee_id`, indicating that the follower is now following the followee. If the edge already exists, the operation should be ignored.  If either user does not exist, the operation should be ignored.

4.  **`unfollow(follower_id, followee_id)`**: Removes the directed edge from `follower_id` to `followee_id`. If the edge does not exist, the operation should be ignored. If either user does not exist, the operation should be ignored.

5.  **`get_followers(user_id)`**: Returns a *sorted* list of `user_id`s representing the followers of the given `user_id`.  The list should be sorted in ascending order. If the user doesn't exist or has no followers, return an empty list.

6.  **`get_following(user_id)`**: Returns a *sorted* list of `user_id`s representing the users followed by the given `user_id`. The list should be sorted in ascending order. If the user doesn't exist or is not following anyone, return an empty list.

7.  **`get_mutual_followers(user_id1, user_id2)`**:  Returns a *sorted* list of `user_id`s representing the users that *both* `user_id1` and `user_id2` follow. The list should be sorted in ascending order. If either user does not exist, return an empty list.

8.  **`get_k_hop_followers(user_id, k)`**: Returns a *sorted* list of `user_id`s representing all users that can reach `user_id` within `k` hops (i.e., a path of length at most `k`). Return an empty list, if user doesn't exist.  The list should be sorted in ascending order. A user should not include itself, even if it can reach itself within *k* hops.

**Constraints:**

*   `user_id` is a positive integer between 1 and 10<sup>9</sup> (inclusive).
*   The number of users and edges can be up to 10<sup>6</sup>.
*   The number of operations can be up to 10<sup>6</sup>.
*   For `get_k_hop_followers(user_id, k)`, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive).
*   All operations must be performed as efficiently as possible.  Inefficient solutions will time out.
*   The memory usage should be optimized.

**Input:**

Your solution should implement a class or struct with the functions described above. The input will be provided through calls to these functions.

**Output:**

The functions `get_followers`, `get_following`, `get_mutual_followers` and `get_k_hop_followers` should return a `std::vector<int>` containing the sorted list of user IDs as specified above.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on correctness, efficiency, and code clarity. Solutions that time out due to inefficient algorithms or data structures will not be accepted. Solutions that use excessive memory may also be penalized.

## Question: Distributed Load Balancing with Adaptive Resource Allocation

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a distributed load balancer for a large-scale online service. The system consists of a set of `N` backend servers and a load balancer that distributes incoming requests among them. Each request has a priority level (an integer from 1 to 10, where 10 is the highest priority).

The backend servers have varying processing capacities and are prone to temporary overloads. Your load balancer needs to:

1.  Distribute requests to backend servers in a way that minimizes the average response time, taking into account request priorities and server capacities.
2.  Adapt to changes in server capacities in real-time. Server capacities can fluctuate due to resource contention or temporary failures.
3.  Handle server failures gracefully by redistributing traffic to the remaining healthy servers.
4.  Prioritize high-priority requests even when the system is under heavy load.

**Input:**

The system state is provided as follows:

*   `N`: The number of backend servers (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   `server_capacities`: A vector of `N` integers, where `server_capacities[i]` represents the current processing capacity (requests per second) of the i-th server (1 <= `server_capacities[i]` <= 1000). This vector can change over time.
*   `requests`: A vector of requests. Each request is represented by its priority level (an integer from 1 to 10).

**Output:**

Your load balancer should output a vector of `N` integers, `request_distribution`, where `request_distribution[i]` represents the number of requests assigned to the i-th server.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Capacity Constraint:** The total number of requests assigned to each server must not exceed its current capacity.
2.  **Priority Handling:** Higher priority requests should be given preference when assigning requests to servers.  If a server is close to capacity, prioritize fulfilling its capacity with high priority requests.
3.  **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the average response time. You can assume that the response time for a request is proportional to the load on the server it is assigned to (i.e., higher load, higher response time).
4.  **Real-time Adaptation:** Your load balancer must be able to quickly adapt to changes in `server_capacities`. Your solution should be efficient enough to handle frequent updates to `server_capacities` without significant performance degradation.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** If a server fails (capacity becomes 0), your load balancer should automatically redistribute its assigned requests to other available servers.
6.  **Scalability:** The solution should scale reasonably well with the number of servers and requests.
7.  **Time Complexity:** Strive for a solution with a time complexity that is better than O(N\*R\*P), where N is the number of servers, R is the number of requests, and P is the number of priority levels, if possible.
8.  **Space Complexity:** Keep the space complexity reasonable.  Avoid storing unnecessary data.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The total capacity of all servers is less than the total number of requests. In this case, you should prioritize high-priority requests and drop the remaining low-priority requests.
*   All servers have a capacity of 0. In this case, all requests should be dropped.
*   The number of requests is very large (e.g., 1 million).
*   Frequent and large fluctuations in server capacities.

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The output `request_distribution` must satisfy all the constraints.
*   **Optimization:** The average response time should be as low as possible.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be able to handle large inputs and frequent updates to `server_capacities` in a reasonable amount of time.
*   **Robustness:** The solution should handle edge cases gracefully.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to detect and handle "thundering herd" problems, where a sudden surge of requests overwhelms the backend servers.
*   Implement a predictive model to anticipate changes in server capacities and proactively adjust the request distribution.

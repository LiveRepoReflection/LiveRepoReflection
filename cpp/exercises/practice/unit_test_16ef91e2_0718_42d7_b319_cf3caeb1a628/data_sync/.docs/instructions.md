## Problem: Optimizing Inter-Datacenter Data Synchronization with Version Vectors

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient data synchronization mechanism between multiple geographically distributed datacenters. Each datacenter holds a replica of the same dataset. To manage concurrent updates and ensure eventual consistency, you will implement a system based on **version vectors**.

Each datacenter is assigned a unique integer ID. Every data object in the system is associated with a version vector. A version vector is a map (dictionary) where keys are datacenter IDs and values are integers representing the number of updates that datacenter has applied to the object. For example, `{1: 5, 2: 3, 3: 1}` indicates that datacenter 1 has applied 5 updates, datacenter 2 has applied 3 updates, and datacenter 3 has applied 1 update to a specific data object.

When a datacenter modifies a data object, it increments its own entry in the object's version vector.  When data is synchronized between datacenters, a datacenter must determine which updates it needs to receive from other datacenters to bring its replica up-to-date.

**Your task is to implement a function `get_missing_updates(local_version_vector, remote_version_vector)` that takes two version vectors as input:**

*   `local_version_vector`: The version vector of the local datacenter's replica of a data object.
*   `remote_version_vector`: The version vector of the remote datacenter's replica of the same data object.

**The function should return a list of datacenter IDs from which the local datacenter needs to pull updates.**  A datacenter ID should be included in the returned list if the `remote_version_vector` indicates that the remote datacenter has applied more updates than the local datacenter for that specific datacenter ID.

**Example:**

```
local_version_vector = {1: 5, 2: 3, 3: 1}
remote_version_vector = {1: 5, 2: 5, 3: 2, 4: 1}

missing_updates = get_missing_updates(local_version_vector, remote_version_vector)
# missing_updates should be [2, 3, 4]
```

**Explanation:**

*   Datacenter 2: `remote_version_vector[2]` (5) > `local_version_vector[2]` (3)  => Needs update.
*   Datacenter 3: `remote_version_vector[3]` (2) > `local_version_vector[3]` (1)  => Needs update.
*   Datacenter 4: `remote_version_vector[4]` (1) exists, but `local_version_vector[4]` does not (implicitly 0) => Needs update.
*   Datacenter 1: `remote_version_vector[1]` (5) == `local_version_vector[1]` (5) => No update needed.

**Constraints:**

*   The datacenter IDs are positive integers.
*   Version vector values are non-negative integers.
*   The version vectors can be sparse (i.e., not all datacenters are necessarily present in every version vector).  If a datacenter ID is not present in a version vector, it implies that the datacenter has applied 0 updates to that object.
*   The function should be optimized for performance, especially when dealing with a large number of datacenters and frequent synchronizations. Assume that reads from the dictionaries are much faster than writes.
*   The order of datacenter IDs in the returned list does not matter.
*   The code should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully.
*   Consider memory footprint when designing the solution.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a function that efficiently merges two version vectors into a single version vector representing the "latest" state.
*   Consider how to handle datacenter failures and re-integrations into the system using version vectors.

This problem challenges you to reason about data synchronization, version control, and efficient algorithm design in a distributed system context. The constraints and bonus challenges push for a solution that is not only correct but also performant and scalable.

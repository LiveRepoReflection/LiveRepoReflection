Okay, here's a challenging C++ problem description, designed to be LeetCode Hard level.

## Problem Title:  Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

### Problem Description

You are designing a task scheduling system for a high-performance computing cluster.  There are `n` tasks to be executed. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id[i]` : A unique integer identifier for the task (0 <= `id[i]` < `n`).  All task IDs are unique.
*   `execution_time[i]` : The time required to execute the task (1 <= `execution_time[i]` <= 10<sup>5</sup>).
*   `deadline[i]` :  The deadline by which the task must be completed (1 <= `deadline[i]` <= 10<sup>9</sup>).
*   `dependencies[i]` : A list of task IDs that must be completed *before* task `i` can start.  Dependencies can form complex directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A task can have zero or more dependencies.

The cluster has `k` identical machines.  Each machine can execute one task at a time.  You can schedule tasks in parallel across the `k` machines. Once a task starts executing on a machine, it must run to completion without interruption.

The objective is to find a schedule that minimizes the *maximum lateness* of any task.  The lateness of a task is defined as `max(0, completion_time - deadline)`, where `completion_time` is the time the task finishes executing.  The *maximum lateness* is the largest lateness among all tasks.

Your function should return the *minimum possible maximum lateness* achievable for the given set of tasks, the number of machines, and their dependencies. If it is impossible to schedule all tasks before their deadlines, return `-1`.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of tasks (1 <= `n` <= 10<sup>5</sup>).
*   `k`: The number of machines (1 <= `k` <= 10<sup>3</sup>).
*   `task_data`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a task: `(id, execution_time, deadline, dependencies)`.  `dependencies` is a vector of integers representing the task IDs of the dependencies.

**Output:**

*   The minimum possible maximum lateness, or `-1` if no feasible schedule exists.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph of task dependencies is guaranteed to be a DAG.
*   All `id[i]` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.
*   `1 <= execution_time[i] <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= deadline[i] <= 10^9`

**Example:**

```c++
n = 4
k = 2
task_data = {
    {0, 5, 10, {}},       // Task 0: id=0, time=5, deadline=10, dependencies={}
    {1, 3, 12, {0}},      // Task 1: id=1, time=3, deadline=12, dependencies={0}
    {2, 4, 15, {0, 1}},   // Task 2: id=2, time=4, deadline=15, dependencies={0, 1}
    {3, 2, 20, {}},       // Task 3: id=3, time=2, deadline=20, dependencies={}
}

// Possible optimal schedule (not the only one):
// Machine 1: Task 0 (0-5), Task 2 (8-12)
// Machine 2: Task 3 (0-2), Task 1 (5-8)
// Max Lateness: max(0, 5-10, 0, 8-12, 0, 12-15, 0, 2-20) = 0
// Output: 0
```

**Challenge Aspects:**

*   **Dependency Management:**  Efficiently handle the task dependencies to ensure tasks are executed in the correct order.
*   **Resource Allocation:**  Strategically allocate tasks to the `k` machines to minimize the overall lateness.
*   **Optimization:**  The problem is NP-hard in general.  Finding the *absolute* optimal solution might be computationally infeasible for larger inputs.  Therefore, you'll need to devise a smart heuristic or approximation algorithm to find a near-optimal solution within a reasonable time complexity.  Consider strategies like Earliest Deadline First (EDF) with topological sorting.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Handle cases where the task dependencies are complex, deadlines are tight, or the number of machines is limited.  Consider the case where a cycle exists in the dependency graph (though this is explicitly ruled out by the constraints, your code should *gracefully* handle an impossible schedule).
*   **Time Complexity:** Aim for a time complexity significantly better than brute force.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, scheduling techniques, and optimization strategies.  Good luck!

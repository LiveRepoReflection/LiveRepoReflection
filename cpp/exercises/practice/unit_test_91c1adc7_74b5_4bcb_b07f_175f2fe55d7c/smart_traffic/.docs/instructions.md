## Question: Optimal Traffic Flow in a Smart City

**Description:**

The city of Metropolis is implementing a new smart traffic management system. The city can be modeled as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent roads. Each road has a capacity (maximum number of vehicles it can handle per unit time) and a current flow (number of vehicles currently using the road per unit time).

The city wants to optimize the traffic flow to minimize the overall travel time for all vehicles. To achieve this, they need to find the maximum possible flow that can be pushed from a designated source intersection (the entry point to the city) to a designated sink intersection (the city center) while respecting the capacity constraints of each road.

However, the situation is complicated by the presence of "toll booths" on certain roads.  Each toll booth has a cost associated with it, representing the delay it introduces to each vehicle passing through it.  The city can choose to temporarily disable some toll booths to increase the overall traffic flow, but disabling each toll booth incurs a fixed penalty.

Your task is to write a program that determines the maximum flow from the source to the sink, taking into account the toll booths and the penalty for disabling them.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of intersections (nodes) in Metropolis, numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `M`: The number of roads (edges).
*   `source`: The index of the source intersection.
*   `sink`: The index of the sink intersection.
*   `roads`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a road with the following information: `(start_node, end_node, capacity, current_flow, toll_booth_cost, disable_penalty)`. If `toll_booth_cost` is 0, then there is no toll booth.

**Output:**

The maximum flow that can be achieved from the source to the sink, after strategically disabling a subset of toll booths to maximize the flow, considering the penalties.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 100
*   1 <= M <= 500
*   0 <= source < N
*   0 <= sink < N
*   0 <= start_node < N
*   0 <= end_node < N
*   0 <= capacity <= 1000
*   0 <= current_flow <= capacity
*   0 <= toll_booth_cost <= 100
*   0 <= disable_penalty <= 10000
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   There might be multiple roads between two intersections.
*   The input is guaranteed to have a feasible solution.
*   The "maximum flow" value should be an integer.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider using efficient graph algorithms and data structures.
*   The algorithm must consider all possible combinations of disabling toll booths or a subset thereof, either explicitly or implicitly.
*   The total penalty for disabling toll booths needs to be subtracted to get the actual maximum flow.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   No path from source to sink.
*   All roads have zero capacity.
*   Source and sink are the same node.
*   The optimal solution might involve disabling no toll booths.
*   The optimal solution might involve disabling all toll booths.

**Example:**

Let's say you have the following input:

```
N = 4
M = 5
source = 0
sink = 3
roads = [
    (0, 1, 10, 5, 5, 100),  // Start, End, Capacity, Current Flow, Toll Cost, Disable Penalty
    (0, 2, 15, 7, 0, 0),
    (1, 2, 25, 10, 10, 50),
    (1, 3, 10, 3, 5, 75),
    (2, 3, 20, 8, 0, 0)
]
```

Your program should determine the maximum flow achievable from node 0 to node 3, considering the toll booths on roads (0, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3) and their corresponding disable penalties. The optimal strategy might involve disabling some or all of these toll booths to maximize the overall flow while minimizing the penalty.

## Question: Optimized Social Network Influencer Identification

**Description:**

You are tasked with identifying the most influential users in a rapidly growing social network. The network consists of users and their connections (friendships). Influence is not just about the number of direct connections (degree centrality), but also about the *quality* of those connections. A user is considered influential if they are connected to other influential users, and if they can quickly spread information throughout the network.

Specifically, you are given a social network represented as a graph. Each node represents a user, and each edge represents a friendship between two users.  Each user has an associated "activity score," representing how actively they participate in the network (e.g., posting, commenting, sharing).

Your task is to design and implement an algorithm to identify the top `K` most influential users in the network. Influence is determined by a novel metric called "Weighted Cascade Reach" (WCR).

**Weighted Cascade Reach (WCR):**

The WCR of a user `u` is calculated by simulating a cascading influence process. The process starts with user `u` as the initial "infected" node (i.e., the user who initially shares a piece of information). The infection spreads to neighboring nodes based on the following rules:

1.  **Initial Infection:** User `u` is initially infected. Their influence score is their activity score.

2.  **Infection Propagation:** When an infected user `v` attempts to infect a neighbor `w`, the infection succeeds with a probability proportional to the *combined* activity score of `v` and `w` relative to the maximum possible combined activity score in the entire network. Let `activity(v)` be the activity score of user `v`, and `max_activity` be the maximum activity score of any user in the network. The probability of infection from `v` to `w` is:

    `P(v -> w) = (activity(v) + activity(w)) / (2 * max_activity)`

3.  **Cascade Steps:** The infection process proceeds in discrete time steps. In each step, all newly infected users from the previous step attempt to infect their uninfected neighbors.

4.  **Reach Calculation:** The WCR of user `u` is the sum of the activity scores of all users infected during the cascade process, *weighted by the time step they were infected*. Specifically, if user `v` is infected at time step `t`, their contribution to the WCR is `activity(v) / t`.  The initial user `u` (infected at time 0) contributes `activity(u) / 1` to the WCR.

5.  **Stopping Condition:** The cascade process continues until no new users are infected in a time step or until a maximum number of steps (`max_steps`) is reached.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of users in the social network (1 <= N <= 10,000).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the friendships between users. Each tuple `(u, v)` indicates that user `u` is friends with user `v`.  The user IDs are integers from 0 to N-1.
*   `activity_scores`: A list of integers representing the activity scores of each user. `activity_scores[i]` is the activity score of user `i`. (1 <= `activity_scores[i]` <= 1000).
*   `K`: The number of top influential users to identify (1 <= K <= min(N, 100)).
*   `max_steps`: The maximum number of steps to simulate the cascade process (1 <= `max_steps` <= 50).

**Output:**

A list of the top `K` most influential user IDs (integers from 0 to N-1), sorted in descending order of their WCR. If multiple users have the same WCR, sort them in ascending order of user ID.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   The graph is undirected.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   The activity scores can vary significantly between users.
*   Optimize for efficiency.  Brute-force simulation of the cascade for every user will likely be too slow.
*   The `max_activity` should be calculated before the WCR calculation, not re-calculated during the process.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
activity_scores = [10, 5, 12, 8, 3]
K = 2
max_steps = 10

# Expected Output: [2, 0]  (Users 2 and 0 are the most influential)
```

**Challenge:**

The primary challenge lies in efficiently calculating the WCR for each user and identifying the top `K` users.  Consider the following:

*   **Optimization:**  Calculating the exact WCR for every user can be computationally expensive, especially for large networks.  Explore techniques to reduce the computational cost while maintaining reasonable accuracy.
*   **Data Structures:**  Choosing appropriate data structures to represent the graph and manage the infection process is crucial for performance.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the graph is disconnected, where activity scores are very low, or where the cascade process quickly reaches all users.
*   **Numerical Stability:** The probabilistic nature of the infection process can lead to variations in the WCR calculation. Consider techniques to mitigate this.  For example, running multiple simulations and averaging the results. However, you will not be able to run multiple simulations with the time constraint.

This problem demands a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, probability, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

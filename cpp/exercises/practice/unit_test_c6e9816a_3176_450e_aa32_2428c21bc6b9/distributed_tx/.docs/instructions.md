Okay, here's a challenging C++ coding problem designed to be at a "LeetCode Hard" level, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and real-world application:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Orchestration

**Problem Description:**

You are building a distributed transaction orchestration system for a microservices architecture.  Multiple microservices need to perform operations as part of a single, atomic transaction.  To achieve this, you are implementing a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol with a central coordinator.

You are given a network of `N` microservices, labeled from `0` to `N-1`. The coordinator resides at microservice `0`. The network topology is represented as a weighted, undirected graph, where each edge `(u, v, w)` indicates a connection between microservices `u` and `v` with a network latency cost of `w`. Assume the graph is always connected.

Each microservice `i` (except the coordinator) has a local operation to perform.  This operation has an associated "preparation cost" `prep_cost[i]` and a "commit cost" `commit_cost[i]`.  These costs represent the computational effort required by the microservice to prepare for the transaction and to actually commit the transaction, respectively.

**The Transaction Process:**

1.  **Prepare Phase:** The coordinator (microservice 0) initiates the transaction by sending a "prepare" message to all other microservices. The message travels through the network along the shortest path to each microservice. Each microservice, upon receiving the prepare message, performs its preparation operation, incurring the `prep_cost[i]`. If any microservice fails during the preparation phase, the entire transaction must be aborted.

2.  **Commit/Abort Phase:**  If all microservices successfully prepare, the coordinator sends a "commit" message to all microservices. Again, these messages travel along the shortest path. Each microservice commits its operation, incurring the `commit_cost[i]`. If any microservice fails to prepare, the coordinator sends an "abort" message to all microservices (again, along shortest paths). In this case, no commit costs are incurred. No explicit rollback operation needs to be implemented.

**Your Task:**

Given:

*   `N`: The number of microservices.
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples representing the network graph edges: `vector<tuple<int, int, int>> edges`. Each tuple is `(u, v, w)`, representing an edge between microservices `u` and `v` with weight `w`.
*   `prep_cost`: A vector of integers representing the preparation cost for each microservice (excluding the coordinator). `prep_cost[i]` is the preparation cost for microservice `i+1`.
*   `commit_cost`: A vector of integers representing the commit cost for each microservice (excluding the coordinator). `commit_cost[i]` is the commit cost for microservice `i+1`.
*   `failure_probability`: A vector of doubles where `failure_probability[i]` is the probability (between 0 and 1 inclusive) that microservice `i+1` will fail during the preparation phase. The coordinator (microservice 0) never fails.

Calculate the *expected total cost* of the distributed transaction. The total cost is the sum of network latency costs, preparation costs, and commit costs (if the transaction commits).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= edges.size() <= N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `1 <= w <= 100` (network latency weight)
*   `0 <= prep_cost[i] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= commit_cost[i] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= failure_probability[i] <= 1`
*   The graph represented by `edges` is connected.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient.  A naive solution that recalculates shortest paths repeatedly will likely time out.
*   Consider the impact of floating-point precision when calculating the expected cost.

**Example:**

Let's say you have 3 Microservices (N=3).

*   `edges = {{0, 1, 10}, {0, 2, 15}, {1, 2, 5}}`
*   `prep_cost = {50, 60}`
*   `commit_cost = {70, 80}`
*   `failure_probability = {0.1, 0.2}`

You need to calculate the expected total cost considering the network latency, preparation costs, commit costs, and the probabilities of failure.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path finding), probability calculation, and careful optimization to handle the constraints and achieve an efficient solution. Good luck!

## Question: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly available and scalable distributed transaction coordinator. This coordinator will manage transactions across multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.). These services do not natively support distributed transactions and rely on the coordinator to orchestrate a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Management:** Implement the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity across participating services. The coordinator must be able to initiate, prepare, commit, and rollback transactions.

2.  **Service Discovery and Registration:** Services must be able to register themselves with the coordinator, providing information on how to participate in transactions. Implement a mechanism for services to discover the coordinator (e.g., using a configuration file or a dedicated service registry).

3.  **Concurrency Control:** The coordinator must handle concurrent transactions efficiently. Minimize blocking and ensure fair resource allocation.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The coordinator must be resilient to failures. If a coordinator instance fails, the system should automatically recover and continue processing in-flight transactions. Consider how to handle coordinator crashes during different phases of the 2PC protocol (prepare, commit, rollback). Implement a mechanism for leader election if using a replicated coordinator setup.

5.  **Scalability:** The coordinator should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and participating services. Consider sharding transaction data or using a distributed consensus algorithm (like Raft or Paxos) to manage coordinator state.

6.  **Performance:** Minimize latency and maximize throughput. Optimize the communication between the coordinator and participating services.

7.  **Idempotency:** Ensure that all operations performed by the coordinator and services are idempotent. This is crucial for handling retries and preventing inconsistencies in case of failures.

8.  **Transaction Isolation:** Provide serializable isolation level, ensuring that concurrently executing transactions do not interfere with each other.

9.  **Deadlock Detection and Resolution:** Implement a mechanism to detect and resolve deadlocks that may occur due to conflicting resource access requests from different transactions.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of participating services can be very large (thousands).
*   Transactions can span multiple services.
*   Network latency between the coordinator and services can be significant.
*   Services may be unavailable or experience transient failures.
*   The coordinator itself should be deployable as a distributed cluster.

**Input:**

The input is not a direct input to the program, but rather a set of service registration requests and transaction requests. Service registration requests will provide the service's identifier, endpoints for prepare, commit and rollback phases, and resource capabilities. Transaction requests will specify the services involved and the operations to be performed on each service.
The input is in the design of your component architecture and the communication protocol.

**Output:**

The output is the successful execution of transactions, ensuring atomicity across participating services. This means that all services involved in a transaction either commit their changes or all rollback, even in the presence of failures. You need to design the system to guarantee this outcome. The output of each transaction is implicit in its successful and atomic completion.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does the coordinator correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity?
*   **Fault Tolerance:** How well does the coordinator handle failures of coordinator instances and participating services?
*   **Scalability:** How does the coordinator scale to handle a large number of services and concurrent transactions?
*   **Performance:** What is the latency and throughput of the coordinator?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Design Choices:** Are the design choices appropriate for the problem requirements? Justify your design decisions.

**Bonus Points:**

*   Implement a mechanism for dynamically adding and removing services without disrupting ongoing transactions.
*   Implement support for compensating transactions to handle situations where a rollback is not possible.
*   Provide a monitoring and alerting system to track the health and performance of the coordinator.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, transaction management, and concurrency control. Good luck!

## Question: Scalable Route Planning for Autonomous Delivery Networks

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a route planning system for a fleet of autonomous delivery drones operating in a densely populated urban environment. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent streets. Each street has a travel time (in seconds), and a capacity, representing the maximum number of drones that can traverse it simultaneously.

The delivery network needs to handle numerous delivery requests concurrently. Each delivery request consists of a start intersection (origin), a destination intersection, a delivery deadline (in seconds from the current time), and a priority level (1-10, where 10 is the highest priority).

The goal is to design an efficient route planning algorithm that can handle a continuous stream of delivery requests and generate near-optimal routes for each drone while adhering to the following constraints:

*   **Capacity Constraints:** The number of drones traversing any given street at any given time must not exceed the street's capacity.
*   **Deadline Constraints:** Each delivery must be completed before its deadline. Late deliveries are heavily penalized.
*   **Priority Handling:** Higher priority deliveries should be prioritized in route planning. If conflicts arise (e.g., two deliveries need to use the same street at the same time), the higher priority delivery should be favored, potentially rerouting lower priority deliveries.
*   **Drone Assignment:** You do not need to implement the drone assignment mechanism. Assume a function `assign_drone(start_intersection)` is available that instantly and optimally assigns an available drone to a delivery request.

**Input:**

Your code will receive the following inputs:

1.  **City Graph:** A representation of the city's directed graph including nodes (intersection IDs), edges (streets), travel times for each street, and capacities for each street. The graph representation can be in any suitable format (e.g., adjacency list, adjacency matrix).
2.  **Continuous Stream of Delivery Requests:** A stream of delivery requests arriving over time. Each request contains:
    *   `start_intersection`: The ID of the starting intersection.
    *   `destination_intersection`: The ID of the destination intersection.
    *   `delivery_deadline`: The deadline for the delivery (in seconds from the current time).
    *   `priority`: The priority level of the delivery (1-10).
    *   `arrival_time`: The time the request arrives at the system.

**Output:**

For each delivery request, your system should output a route (a list of intersection IDs in the order they should be visited) for the assigned drone. If a route cannot be found that satisfies all constraints (capacity, deadline), output "No Route Possible".

**Constraints:**

*   **Scale:** The city graph can be large (up to 10,000 intersections and 50,000 streets).
*   **Real-time Performance:** The route planning algorithm must be efficient enough to handle a high volume of delivery requests in real-time. Route planning for a single request should ideally complete within a few seconds.
*   **Dynamic Environment:** The state of the delivery network (drone positions, street capacities) is constantly changing as deliveries are being made. Your algorithm must account for these dynamic changes.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The routes generated must be valid and adhere to all constraints (capacity, deadline).
*   **Efficiency:** The route planning algorithm must be efficient and scalable to handle a large number of delivery requests in real-time.
*   **Optimization:** The routes generated should be near-optimal in terms of travel time.
*   **Priority Handling:** The system should effectively prioritize higher priority deliveries.
*   **Robustness:** The system should handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., disconnected graph, impossible delivery requests).

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a combination of graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search) and optimization techniques (e.g., constraint programming, integer programming) to solve this problem.
*   Think about how to represent and update the state of the delivery network efficiently.
*   Explore techniques for handling conflicts between delivery requests.
*   Pay attention to data structures and algorithm choices to optimize performance.
*   Pre-computation of shortest paths might be useful.

Good luck!

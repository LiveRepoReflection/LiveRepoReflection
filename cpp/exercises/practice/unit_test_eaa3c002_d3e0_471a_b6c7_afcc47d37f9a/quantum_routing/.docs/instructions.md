## The Quantum Network Routing Problem

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a highly experimental, fault-prone quantum network. This network consists of `N` quantum nodes, numbered from 0 to N-1. Each node can potentially communicate with any other node through a direct quantum channel. However, these quantum channels are extremely unstable and have a probability of failing at any given time.

Your goal is to design a routing algorithm that can reliably transmit a quantum message (a "qubit") from a source node `S` to a destination node `D`. Due to the nature of quantum mechanics, you cannot simply copy and resend the qubit. Instead, you must rely on quantum teleportation, which requires establishing entangled pairs between nodes.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The network's initial state is represented as an adjacency matrix `channel_probabilities[N][N]`. `channel_probabilities[i][j]` (and `channel_probabilities[j][i]`) represents the probability (between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) that a quantum channel *exists* between node `i` and node `j` at any given time. A probability of 0.0 means there is no channel, and 1.0 means a perfectly reliable channel.

2.  **Quantum Teleportation:** To send a qubit from node `A` to node `B`, a pre-existing entangled pair is required between `A` and `B`. The establishment of an entangled pair has a time cost that you can ignore for this problem, as the network has pre-existing entangled pairs. If a quantum channel exists between A and B, teleportation can happen instantaneously.

3.  **Channel Failures:** At each time step, channels exist independently based on their probabilities. If a channel needed for teleportation does not exist, the teleportation operation fails for that time step, and you must retry.

4.  **Routing Strategy:** Your algorithm must determine the optimal path (sequence of nodes) to transmit the qubit from source `S` to destination `D`. The path must be chosen to minimize the *expected* number of teleportation steps needed to successfully transmit the qubit.

5.  **Time Limit:** There is a maximum number of allowed attempts to teleport the qubit. If the qubit does not reach the destination within this limit, the algorithm fails.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of quantum nodes (1 <= N <= 100).
*   `channel_probabilities[N][N]`: A 2D array representing the probability of a quantum channel existing between each pair of nodes.
*   `S`: The source node (0 <= S < N).
*   `D`: The destination node (0 <= D < N).
*   `max_attempts`: The maximum number of teleportation attempts allowed (1 <= max_attempts <= 10000).

**Output:**

Return an `std::vector<int>` representing the optimal path (sequence of nodes) from the source `S` to the destination `D`. If no path can be found within the `max_attempts`, return an empty vector.
If `S` is equal to `D`, return a vector containing only `S`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Optimization:** The primary goal is to minimize the *expected* number of teleportation steps. This requires considering both the path length and the channel probabilities.
*   **Dynamic Programming/Graph Algorithms:** Consider using graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford, potentially adapted to handle probabilities instead of distances. Dynamic programming may also be useful for pre-calculating expected path lengths.
*   **Cycles:** Your algorithm must handle the possibility of cycles in the path. Ensure that cycles do not lead to infinite loops or significantly increase the expected number of steps.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle cases where there is no path between the source and destination (return an empty vector).
    *   Handle cases where the source and destination are the same (return a vector containing only the source node).
    *   Handle cases where channel probabilities are extremely low (may require a very high `max_attempts`).
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle larger networks (N = 100) within a reasonable time. Pre-computation may be necessary to improve performance.
*   **Floating-Point Precision:** Be mindful of potential precision issues when dealing with floating-point probabilities. Avoid direct equality comparisons.
*   **Realistic Network:** The probabilities represent a realistic network, so some nodes may be completely isolated. Make sure to handle isolated nodes appropriately.

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, probability, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

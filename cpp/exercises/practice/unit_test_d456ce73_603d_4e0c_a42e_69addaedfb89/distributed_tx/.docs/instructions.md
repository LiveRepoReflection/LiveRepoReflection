## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture. Imagine a system where multiple independent services need to participate in a single, atomic transaction.  If any service fails to complete its part of the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participating services.

Your coordinator should handle the complexities of ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) across these distributed services, even in the presence of failures.

Specifically, you need to implement the core logic for a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

**Services:**

Assume there are `N` microservices participating in the transaction. Each service has two operations:

1.  **`prepare()`:**  This method is called by the coordinator to ask the service if it is ready to commit its part of the transaction. The service performs necessary checks (e.g., resource availability, data validation) and returns `true` if it's ready to commit, or `false` if it cannot commit.  A service may also throw an exception if a severe error occurs during preparation.
2.  **`commit()`:** This method is called by the coordinator to instruct the service to permanently commit its changes. The service performs the commit operation.  It is assumed that `commit()` will always succeed after `prepare()` has returned `true`, or will throw an exception if `prepare()` hasn't returned true.
3.  **`rollback()`:** This method is called by the coordinator to instruct the service to undo its changes. The service performs the rollback operation. The rollback operation should be idempotent (i.e., it can be called multiple times without changing the outcome after the first execution).

**Coordinator Requirements:**

Your coordinator should implement the following:

1.  **`begin_transaction(service_list)`:**  Initializes the transaction with a list of participating services. `service_list` is a list of service objects. Each service object has the `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods.
2.  **`execute_transaction()`:** Executes the 2PC protocol. This involves the following steps:

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):**
        *   The coordinator calls `prepare()` on each service in the `service_list`.
        *   The coordinator waits for responses from all services.
        *   If *all* services respond with `true`, the coordinator proceeds to Phase 2.
        *   If *any* service responds with `false` or throws an exception, the coordinator initiates a rollback by calling `rollback()` on *all* services.
        *   Implement a timeout mechanism. If a service doesn't respond within a specified timeout (e.g., 5 seconds), treat it as a failure and initiate a rollback.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit Phase):**
        *   The coordinator calls `commit()` on each service in the `service_list`.
        *   If any service throws an exception during commit, it is considered a critical error. Log the error. The coordinator should continue to attempt to commit for a configurable number of retries, with exponential backoff. If commit never succeeds, an external intervention is needed.
3.  **Error Handling:**  The coordinator must handle exceptions thrown by services during `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()`.  It must log errors appropriately and ensure that the transaction either commits successfully or rolls back completely. All exceptions should be caught and handled; no exceptions should escape the coordinator.

**Constraints:**

*   **Atomicity:**  The transaction must be atomic â€“ either all services commit, or all services rollback.
*   **Durability:** Once a service commits, the changes must be durable (persisted).  (Assume services handle persistence internally).
*   **Isolation:** You do not need to implement isolation. Assume that services handle isolation internally.
*   **Concurrency:** You do not need to handle concurrent transactions. Assume that only one transaction is running at a time.
*   **Deadlock:** You do not need to handle deadlock.
*   **Idempotency:** Ensure the rollback operation is idempotent.
*   **Timeout:** Implement a timeout for the prepare phase.
*   **Commit Retry:** Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the commit phase.
*   The number of participating services (N) can be large (up to 1000). Optimize your coordinator to handle this scale efficiently.
*   Assume the network is unreliable. Services can fail or become temporarily unavailable.
*   The `prepare()` method can take a significant amount of time to execute (up to several seconds).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Maximize throughput (transactions completed per unit of time).
*   Minimize latency (time taken to complete a single transaction).
*   Utilize concurrency where appropriate to improve performance.

**Input:**

*   A list of `N` service objects, where each service object has `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods.

**Output:**

*   The `execute_transaction()` method should return `true` if the transaction committed successfully, and `false` if the transaction was rolled back.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, exception handling, concurrency, and optimization techniques. It's designed to be challenging and should take a significant amount of time to solve correctly and efficiently. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem description designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

## Problem: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Resource Constraints

**Description:**

You are given a set of `N` tasks to be executed on a distributed computing system. Each task `i` has the following attributes:

*   `id_i`: A unique identifier for the task (integer).
*   `duration_i`: The time required to complete the task (integer).
*   `resource_i`: The amount of a specific resource required by the task (integer).
*   `dependencies_i`: A list of `id`s representing the tasks that *must* be completed before task `i` can start (list of integers).

The distributed computing system has the following constraints:

*   **Resource Limit:** The system has a limited amount of the specific resource, denoted by `R`. At any given time, the sum of the `resource_i` values for all tasks being executed *concurrently* cannot exceed `R`.
*   **Dependency Constraint:** A task cannot start until all its dependencies have been completed.
*   **Non-preemption:** Once a task starts, it must run to completion without interruption.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Multiple tasks can be executed concurrently as long as the resource limit is not exceeded and all dependencies are satisfied.
*   **Minimization Objective:** Find the schedule that minimizes the makespan, i.e., the time when the last task completes.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks (integer). `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `R`: The total resource available (integer). `1 <= R <= 1000`
*   A list of `N` task descriptions, where each task description is a tuple: `(id_i, duration_i, resource_i, dependencies_i)`.
    *   `1 <= id_i <= N` (all `id_i` are unique)
    *   `1 <= duration_i <= 1000`
    *   `1 <= resource_i <= R`
    *   `dependencies_i` is a list of `id`s of tasks that must be completed before task `i` can begin. The dependency graph is guaranteed to be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

**Output:**

*   The minimum possible makespan (integer) for executing all `N` tasks while satisfying all constraints.

**Constraints & Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:**  The solution must be efficient enough to handle large numbers of tasks (`N=1000`). Naive brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where tasks have no dependencies, tasks that depend on each other in complex chains, tasks with high resource requirements, and scenarios where the resource limit is very restrictive.
*   **Optimality:** The solution must find the *minimum* makespan. Suboptimal solutions will not be accepted.
*   **DAG Guarantee:** While the dependency graph is a DAG, it can be sparse or dense, potentially forming long chains or wide fan-out/fan-in patterns.
*   **Resource Contention:** The scheduler must intelligently resolve resource contention between tasks that are ready to be executed.  Prioritization strategies may be necessary.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
R = 10
tasks = [
    (1, 5, 3, []),  # Task 1, duration 5, resource 3, no dependencies
    (2, 3, 4, [1]), # Task 2, duration 3, resource 4, depends on Task 1
    (3, 2, 5, [1]), # Task 3, duration 2, resource 5, depends on Task 1
    (4, 4, 2, [2, 3]) # Task 4, duration 4, resource 2, depends on Task 2 and Task 3
]

Output: 12

Explanation:
One optimal schedule is:

Time 0-5: Task 1 (resource 3)
Time 5-8: Task 2 (resource 4)
Time 5-7: Task 3 (resource 5)
Time 8-12: Task 4 (resource 2)

Total makespan: 12
```

This problem requires careful consideration of dependency relationships, resource constraints, and optimization strategies. It challenges the solver to design a sophisticated scheduling algorithm. Good luck!

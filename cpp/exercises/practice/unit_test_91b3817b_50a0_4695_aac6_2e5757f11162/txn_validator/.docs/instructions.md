Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Validator

**Description:**

You are building a critical component for a distributed database system: a transaction validator. In this system, transactions can span multiple nodes, and each node maintains a partial view of the overall transaction state. The validator's job is to determine, given the logs from various nodes participating in a transaction, whether the transaction can be safely committed or must be aborted.

A transaction involves a set of *resources*.  Each resource has a current *version*. A transaction reads and potentially modifies resources. A transaction is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent operations on resources and edges represent dependencies between operations.  An operation consists of:

1.  **Resource ID:** The unique identifier of the resource being accessed.
2.  **Read Version:** The version of the resource that the operation *expects* to see when it executes.
3.  **Write Version (Optional):** If the operation modifies the resource, this is the *new* version of the resource after the operation.  If the operation only reads, this field is absent.

The transaction proceeds in discrete *rounds*. In each round, each participating node executes a subset of the available operations, based on dependency rules and resource availability.

A transaction is considered **committable** if and only if all of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Version Consistency:** For every operation, the `Read Version` must match the *actual* version of the resource present at the node where the operation is executed *at the time of execution*.
2.  **Acyclicity:** The provided transaction graph must indeed be a DAG.  Any cycles detected must result in a rejection of the transaction.
3.  **Atomicity:** If any operation within the transaction fails due to version inconsistency, the entire transaction must be aborted.
4.  **Completeness:** All operations within the transaction graph must eventually be executed. If, due to dependencies or resource version conflicts, some operations remain unexecuted, the transaction must be aborted.
5. **Real-time**: The validator must determine the outcome of the transaction within a given time limit.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following:

*   `num_resources`: An integer representing the total number of resources in the system. Resources are identified by IDs from 0 to `num_resources - 1`.
*   `transaction_graph`: A representation of the transaction as a list of operations and dependencies. Each operation is a tuple `(node_id, resource_id, read_version, write_version_or_null)`. Dependencies are represented as a list of tuples `(source_node_id, destination_node_id)`.
*   `node_logs`: A dictionary where keys are node IDs (integers) and values are lists of operations executed by that node, in the *order* they were executed. Each operation in the log is a tuple `(node_id, resource_id, version_at_execution)`.

**Output:**

Return a string: `"COMMIT"` if the transaction is committable according to the rules above, and `"ABORT"` otherwise.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_resources <= 100`
*   `1 <= number of operations <= 1000`
*   `1 <= number of nodes <= 100`
*   Resource versions are non-negative integers.
* The number of operations recorded in `node_logs` might be less than the total number of operations in the transaction graph, as not all operations may be executed.
* All `node_id` in operations and logs are valid, that is, greater than or equal to 0.
* All `resource_id` in operations and logs are valid, that is, less than `num_resources`.
* Timeout: The validator must determine commit/abort within 1 second.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a transaction that intends to transfer an item from user A to user B.  This involves reading A's item count, deducting one, reading B's item count, and adding one. Version conflicts could arise if another transaction modifies A's or B's item counts concurrently.

**Challenge:**

The main challenge is efficiently validating the transaction given the distributed logs. You need to consider:

*   How to represent the transaction graph efficiently.
*   How to track resource versions across nodes.
*   How to efficiently detect cycles in the transaction graph.
*   How to determine if all operations were eventually executed, even if some nodes experience failures or delays.
*   How to achieve good performance within the time constraint.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, graph algorithms, and efficient data structures. Good luck!

Okay, here's a high-difficulty C++ programming competition problem designed to challenge solvers with algorithmic efficiency, advanced data structures, and numerous edge cases.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Validation

### Problem Description

You are designing a distributed database system.  A core component of this system is the transaction validation service. Transactions are submitted from various clients and need to be validated for consistency before being committed. Due to the distributed nature of the database, validation requires checking data across multiple nodes.

Each transaction involves a set of `operations`. Each `operation` reads from or writes to a specific `data item` on a specific `node`. You are given a log of transactions and a description of the database cluster. Your task is to determine the **maximum number of transactions that can be committed without violating serializability**.

**Database Cluster Description:**

The database cluster consists of `N` nodes, numbered from 0 to N-1. Each node contains a set of `data items`.  Each `data item` is identified by a unique string key.

**Transaction Description:**

A transaction consists of a sequence of operations. Each operation is one of the following types:

*   **READ(node_id, data_item_key):** Reads the value of `data_item_key` on `node_id`.
*   **WRITE(node_id, data_item_key, value):** Writes `value` to `data_item_key` on `node_id`.

**Serializability:**

A set of transactions is serializable if there exists a total order of the transactions such that executing them in that order produces the same result as executing them concurrently. In simpler terms, we need to find a way to order the transactions so that their effects are the same as if they ran one after another, without any interleaving.

**Conflict:**

Two operations conflict if they access the same `data_item_key` on the same `node_id`, and at least one of them is a `WRITE` operation.  Transactions conflict if they contain conflicting operations.

**Input:**

The input consists of the following:

1.  `N`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the database cluster (1 <= N <= 100).
2.  `M`: An integer representing the number of data items across all nodes (1 <= M <= 1000).
3.  A list of `T` transactions (1 <= T <= 2000). Each transaction is described as follows:
    *   `num_operations`: An integer representing the number of operations in the transaction (1 <= num_operations <= 100).
    *   A list of `num_operations` operations. Each operation is described as follows:
        *   `operation_type`: A string, either "READ" or "WRITE".
        *   `node_id`: An integer representing the node ID (0 <= node_id < N).
        *   `data_item_key`: A string representing the data item key.
        *   (If `operation_type` is "WRITE"): `value`: An integer representing the value to be written.

**Output:**

An integer representing the maximum number of transactions that can be committed without violating serializability.

**Constraints:**

*   All `data_item_key` strings will consist of lowercase English letters and have a length between 1 and 10 characters.
*   `value` will be an integer between -1000 and 1000.
*   The input transactions are valid, meaning that `node_id` will always be within the valid range and the format of each operation will be correct.
*   The total number of operations across all transactions will not exceed 200,000.
*   The number of transactions that can be committed without violating serializability will always be greater than 0.

**Example:**

Let's say we have two transactions:

Transaction 1:
*   READ(0, "x")
*   WRITE(0, "x", 10)

Transaction 2:
*   WRITE(0, "x", 20)
*   READ(0, "x")

These two transactions cannot be serialized because there's a conflict on data item "x" at node 0. If we execute Transaction 1 first, "x" becomes 10, and then Transaction 2 will read 10. If we execute Transaction 2 first, "x" becomes 20, and then Transaction 1 will read 20. Since the result depends on the order, they are not serializable.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on correctness and efficiency. Solutions that are inefficient or exceed the time limit will not be accepted.  Emphasis is placed on handling a large number of transactions and operations efficiently.

**Hints:**

*   Think about how to detect conflicts between transactions.
*   Consider using a graph to represent the dependencies between transactions.
*   Explore algorithms for finding the maximum independent set in a graph (although finding the *exact* maximum independent set is NP-hard, you might be able to use approximation algorithms or heuristics that perform well in practice).  Consider that you don't need to find the *exact* maximum independent set, just a large serializable subset.
*   Be mindful of the time complexity of your solution, as the input size can be significant.
*   Consider topological sorting.
*   Consider dynamic programming.

This problem requires a deep understanding of transaction management in distributed systems, advanced data structures, and efficient algorithms. Good luck!

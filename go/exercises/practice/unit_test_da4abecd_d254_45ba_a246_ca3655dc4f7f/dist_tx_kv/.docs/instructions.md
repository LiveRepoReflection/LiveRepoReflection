## Question: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Conflict Resolution

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed key-value store that supports ACID transactions across multiple nodes. This system should handle concurrent transactions, detect and resolve conflicts, and ensure data consistency even in the presence of network partitions and node failures.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Key-Value Store:** Implement a key-value store where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Use a consistent hashing mechanism (e.g., Ketama or Rendezvous Hashing) to determine data placement.

2.  **ACID Transactions:** Support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. Transactions can involve multiple operations (reads and writes) across different keys, potentially on different nodes.

3.  **Concurrency Control:** Implement a concurrency control mechanism to manage concurrent transactions. Consider using Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) with versioning or Timestamp Ordering (TO) for conflict detection.

4.  **Conflict Resolution:** Develop a conflict resolution strategy. When concurrent transactions modify the same key, detect the conflict and resolve it.  Implement a mechanism to rollback conflicting transactions, allowing others to proceed. In the case of OCC, the first committer wins.  In the case of TO, the transaction with earlier timestamp wins.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** Ensure the system remains operational even when nodes fail or network partitions occur.  Implement data replication (e.g., using chain replication or Paxos/Raft for consensus) to provide fault tolerance.

6.  **Data Recovery:** When a node recovers from a failure, it should be able to synchronize its data with the rest of the system. Implement a mechanism for data recovery and reconciliation.

**Input:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on its ability to handle a stream of transactions. Each transaction will consist of a series of read and write operations.

*   **Read(key):** Reads the value associated with the given key.
*   **Write(key, value):** Writes the given value to the given key.
*   **Commit():** Attempts to commit the transaction.
*   **Abort():** Aborts the transaction.

**Output:**

For each `Read(key)` operation, return the current value of the key. If the key does not exist, return `null`. For each `Commit()` operation, return `true` if the transaction was successfully committed, and `false` if it was aborted due to a conflict or failure. `Abort()` operation will always be successful.

**Constraints:**

*   **Number of Nodes:** The system should support a configurable number of nodes (e.g., 3-10).
*   **Data Size:** The size of keys and values should be limited (e.g., up to 1KB).
*   **Transaction Size:** The number of operations within a single transaction should be limited (e.g., up to 10).
*   **Concurrency:** The system should be able to handle a high degree of concurrent transactions.
*   **Latency:** Minimize the latency for read and write operations, especially for non-conflicting transactions.
*   **Consistency:** The system must maintain strong consistency, ensuring that all nodes eventually see the same data.
*   **Durability:** Committed transactions must be durable, even in the face of node failures.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does the system correctly implement ACID transactions and handle conflicts?
*   **Performance:** How well does the system perform under concurrent load, in terms of throughput and latency?
*   **Fault Tolerance:** How well does the system handle node failures and network partitions?
*   **Scalability:** How well does the system scale as the number of nodes and the data size increase?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement support for snapshot isolation.
*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and resolving deadlocks.
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the health and performance of the system.

This is a complex problem requiring a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and data structure mastery.

### Project Name

`DistributedLoadBalancer`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed load balancer that efficiently distributes incoming requests across a cluster of servers.  The load balancer must handle a massive influx of requests and dynamically adjust to server availability and capacity.

**System Architecture:**

*   **Servers:**  A set of `n` servers, each identified by a unique integer ID (1 to `n`). Each server has a maximum processing capacity (requests per second) represented as an integer. This capacity can change dynamically during runtime.
*   **Requests:** Incoming requests arrive at the load balancer. Each request is a simple unit of work that needs to be assigned to one of the available servers.
*   **Load Balancer:** The central component that receives requests and distributes them to the servers.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Dynamic Server Capacity:** The load balancer must be able to handle changes in server capacity.  A server's capacity can increase or decrease at any time.
2.  **Server Availability:** Servers can become unavailable (e.g., due to failure or maintenance).  The load balancer must detect and exclude unavailable servers from the distribution process and re-incorporate them when they become available again.
3.  **Weighted Round Robin Distribution:** The load balancer should implement a *weighted* round-robin distribution strategy. This means that servers with higher capacity should receive proportionally more requests than servers with lower capacity.  The weighting should be continuously adjusted to reflect the current server capacities.
4.  **Near Real-Time Performance:** The load balancer should distribute requests with minimal latency.  The goal is to maximize throughput and minimize the time it takes for a request to be assigned to a server.
5.  **Scalability:** The load balancer should be designed to handle a large number of servers and a very high request rate.
6.  **Concurrency:** The load balancer must handle concurrent requests and server capacity updates safely and efficiently.
7.  **Even distribution:** The load balancer should make sure that all servers are as evenly loaded as possible given their capacity.

**Input:**

The load balancer will receive the following types of events:

*   `AddServer(serverID int, capacity int)`: Adds a new server to the load balancer with the given ID and capacity.
*   `RemoveServer(serverID int)`: Removes the server with the given ID from the load balancer.
*   `UpdateCapacity(serverID int, newCapacity int)`: Updates the capacity of the server with the given ID.
*   `Request()`: An incoming request that needs to be assigned to a server.
*   `MarkServerAvailable(serverID int)`: Marks a previously unavailable server as available.
*   `MarkServerUnavailable(serverID int)`: Marks a server as unavailable.

**Output:**

*   For each `Request()`, the load balancer should return the `serverID` of the server to which the request is assigned.
*   Other operations do not need to return any value.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5` (Number of servers)
*   `1 <= capacity <= 10^6` (Server capacity)
*   The number of `Request()` calls can be very large (up to `10^7`).
*   Server IDs are unique and within the range `[1, n]`.
*   The load balancer should be thread-safe.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the average latency of request assignment.
*   Maximize the throughput of the load balancer.
*   Minimize the overhead of updating server capacities.
*   Ensure efficient handling of server availability changes.

**Example:**

```go
//Initial State
//Load Balancer receives:
AddServer(1, 100)
AddServer(2, 200)
AddServer(3, 300)
//Request1 comes in
Request() // Should return either 1, 2 or 3. 3 is more likely.
//Load Balancer receives:
UpdateCapacity(1, 50)
//Request2 comes in
Request() // Should return either 1, 2 or 3. 3 is more likely.
//Load Balancer receives:
RemoveServer(2)
//Request3 comes in
Request() // Should return either 1 or 3. 3 is more likely.
//Load Balancer receives:
MarkServerUnavailable(3)
//Request4 comes in
Request() // Should return 1.
//Load Balancer receives:
MarkServerAvailable(3)
//Request5 comes in
Request() // Should return either 1 or 3. 3 is more likely.
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The load balancer must correctly distribute requests according to the weighted round-robin strategy, considering server capacities and availability.
*   Performance: The load balancer must achieve high throughput and low latency.
*   Scalability: The load balancer must be able to handle a large number of servers and a high request rate.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Efficiency: The solution should utilize efficient data structures and algorithms.

This problem is designed to be challenging due to the need for efficient data structures and algorithms to manage the dynamic server pool and implement the weighted round-robin distribution under high load. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations:

## Project Name

```
InterplanetaryNetwork
```

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an interplanetary communication network.  There are `n` planets in the solar system, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Due to orbital mechanics, the distance between any two planets changes over time.  You are given a time-dependent distance function `distance(planet1, planet2, time)` which returns the distance between `planet1` and `planet2` at a given `time`. This distance function is computationally expensive, meaning each call significantly impacts performance.

You need to implement a system to efficiently find the *minimum cost* to establish a connected communication network spanning all `n` planets at a specific *target time*.  The cost of connecting two planets is the distance between them at the target time.  You can directly connect any two planets.

**Input:**

*   `n`:  An integer representing the number of planets (1 <= n <= 1000).
*   `targetTime`: An integer representing the specific target time for establishing the network (0 <= targetTime <= 10^9).
*   `distance(planet1, planet2, time)`: A function that takes two planet indices (`planet1`, `planet2`) and a `time` as input and returns the distance (a float64 value) between them at that time.  Assume `0 <= planet1 < n`, `0 <= planet2 < n`, `planet1 != planet2`, and `0 <= time <= 10^9`.  The distance function is provided to you; you don't need to implement it.  It is guaranteed that `distance(planet1, planet2, time) == distance(planet2, planet1, time)`.

**Output:**

*   A `float64` representing the minimum cost to connect all planets at the `targetTime`. The result should be accurate to within 10^-6.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Efficiency is Critical:** The `distance` function is computationally expensive. Minimize the number of calls to this function. Solutions that naively compute distances between all planet pairs will likely time out.
2.  **Large Input:**  `n` can be up to 1000, so algorithmic complexity matters.
3.  **Floating-Point Precision:**  Be mindful of floating-point precision issues when calculating the total cost.
4.  **Connected Network:**  The final network must be connected, meaning there must be a path (direct or indirect) between any two planets in the network.
5.  **Edge Cases:** Consider the case where n = 1.

**Hints:**

*   Think about classic algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees.  How can you adapt them to minimize calls to the expensive `distance` function?
*   Consider using appropriate data structures to keep track of visited/connected planets and the distances between them.
*   Implement the solution in the Go programming language.

This problem combines algorithmic knowledge (MST), data structure usage, and the practical consideration of optimizing calls to an expensive function, making it a challenging and realistic problem. Good luck!

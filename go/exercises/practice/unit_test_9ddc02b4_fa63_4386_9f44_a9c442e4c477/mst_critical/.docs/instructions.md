### Question Description

You are given a connected, undirected graph represented as a list of edges. Each edge has a weight associated with it. Your task is to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of this graph using Kruskal's algorithm.

However, there's a twist:

You are also given a set of *k* "critical" nodes.  The MST you construct *must* include paths that connect all the critical nodes.  If Kruskal's algorithm, in its standard form, doesn't automatically connect all critical nodes, you must add edges (of minimum weight) to ensure connectivity among these critical nodes *before* applying the standard Kruskal algorithm to the rest of the graph. The added edges should be minimized.

Specifically, your task is to:

1.  **Connect Critical Nodes:** If the initial set of edges does not connect all critical nodes, find the minimum weight edges required to connect them into a single connected component.  You must achieve this with the minimum total weight of added edges.
2.  **Standard Kruskal:** After (potentially) adding edges to connect the critical nodes, proceed with the standard Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST for the *entire* graph (including the artificially added edges, if any).
3.  **Return Total Weight:** Return the total weight of the MST you have constructed.  This includes the weight of the edges from the original graph *and* the weight of any artificially added edges needed to connect the critical nodes.

**Input:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1).
*   `edges`: A slice of slices, where each inner slice represents an edge in the format `[node1, node2, weight]`.
*   `criticalNodes`: A slice of integers representing the indices of the critical nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= min(2 * 10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)` (sparse graph)
*   `0 <= node1, node2 < n`
*   `1 <= weight <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= len(criticalNodes) <= n`
*   The input graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   There are no self-loops or duplicate edges in the input.

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the total weight of the MST that includes paths connecting all critical nodes.

**Example:**

```
n = 6
edges = [[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 6], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 5], [2, 3, 7], [2, 4, 9], [3, 4, 3], [3, 5, 2], [4, 5, 8]]
criticalNodes = [0, 4, 5]

// Expected Output: 16
// Explanation:  The MST without considering critical nodes would have a weight less than 16.
// To connect 0, 4, and 5, we need to add edges. The optimal edges to add are:
// - (3, 5) with weight 2 (already in the graph, but included because 5 is critical)
// - (3, 4) with weight 3 (already in the graph, but included because 4 is critical)
// - (0, 1) with weight 4
// - (1, 2) with weight 1
// - (2, 3) with weight 7
// Total weight: 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 7 = 17
// To connect 0, 4, and 5 more efficiently:
// - (3, 5) with weight 2 (already in the graph, but included because 5 is critical)
// - (3, 4) with weight 3 (already in the graph, but included because 4 is critical)
// - (0, 1) with weight 4
// - (1, 2) with weight 1
// - (2, 3) with weight 7
//
// A possible MST could be the following:
// (0, 1, 4), (1, 2, 1), (3, 5, 2), (3, 4, 3), (2, 3, 7)
// This MST connects all critical nodes (0, 4, 5).
// Total Weight: 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 17
```

**Considerations for Difficulty:**

*   **Efficiency:** A naive solution will likely be too slow due to the constraints on `n` and `edges`. An efficient implementation of Kruskal's algorithm with Union-Find is essential.
*   **Critical Node Connectivity:** Finding the minimum weight edges to connect the critical nodes requires careful consideration. It might involve a modified shortest-path algorithm or a greedy approach. The time complexity of this step is critical.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle the case where the critical nodes are already connected by the initial edges, or where the number of critical nodes is small.
*   **Data Structures:** Choosing appropriate data structures (e.g., priority queue, Union-Find) significantly impacts performance.

This problem combines a classic graph algorithm with an additional constraint, requiring both algorithmic knowledge and optimization skills. Good luck!

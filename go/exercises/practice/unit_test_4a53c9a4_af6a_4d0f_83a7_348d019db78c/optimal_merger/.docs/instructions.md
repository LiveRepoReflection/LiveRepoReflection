Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description, designed to be as difficult as a LeetCode Hard level question:

## Project Name

`OptimalMerger`

## Question Description

You are given a large collection of sorted log files. Each log file contains entries with timestamps (represented as Unix timestamps - seconds since epoch).  Your task is to design and implement a system that efficiently merges these log files into a single, chronologically sorted output stream.

**Input:**

*   A list of file paths to the log files.  Assume these files are very large and cannot all be loaded into memory at once.
*   A target output file path where the merged, sorted log entries should be written.
*   A maximum memory budget (in bytes) that your program can use.  Exceeding this budget will result in termination. This constraint is crucial.
*   A maximum number of open files that your program can have at any given time.  Exceeding this limit will result in termination.

**Output:**

*   A single file containing all log entries from the input files, sorted chronologically by timestamp. Each line in the output file should represent a log entry. The format of log entries in the input files should be preserved in the output file.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Memory Efficiency:**  The solution must operate within the specified memory budget. This effectively prohibits loading entire files into memory.  The solution MUST use a streaming approach.
2.  **File Handle Limit:** The solution must respect the maximum number of open files constraint. Opening too many files simultaneously will lead to failure. You should aim to minimize the number of concurrently open files.
3.  **Timestamp Ordering:** The output file *must* be perfectly sorted by timestamp. Even a single out-of-order entry is unacceptable.
4.  **Large Files:**  The input files can be extremely large (e.g., hundreds of gigabytes each).  Your solution must be able to handle this without crashing or running out of memory.
5.  **Error Handling:**  The program must handle potential errors gracefully, including:
    *   Invalid file paths
    *   Corrupted log entries (e.g., lines without valid timestamps)
    *   Insufficient disk space for the output file
    *   Files not sorted
6.  **Performance:** The solution should be optimized for speed.  Minimize the number of disk I/O operations.  Consider using appropriate data structures to facilitate efficient merging.
7.  **Scalability:** The solution should be designed to scale to a large number of input log files.
8.  **Timestamp Uniqueness:** Timestamps are not guaranteed to be unique. If entries have the same timestamp, their original order in the input files should be maintained in the output.
9.  **Assumptions:**
    *   Timestamps are integers representing seconds since the epoch.
    *   Each line in the log file represents a single log entry.
    *   Log entries within a single file are already sorted by timestamp.
10. **Edge Cases:**
    *   Empty input file list.
    *   One or more input files are empty.
    *   All input files contain the same timestamp.
    *   Input files with overlapping timestamp ranges.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The merged output must be perfectly sorted and contain all entries from the input files.
*   **Memory Usage:** The solution must operate within the memory budget.
*   **File Handle Usage:** The solution must not exceed the maximum number of open files.
*   **Performance:** The solution should be as fast as possible, especially for large files and a large number of input files.
*   **Error Handling:** The solution must handle errors gracefully.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. The memory constraint forces the use of a streaming approach, and the file handle limit adds another layer of complexity. The sheer size of the input files necessitates efficient I/O operations. Good luck!

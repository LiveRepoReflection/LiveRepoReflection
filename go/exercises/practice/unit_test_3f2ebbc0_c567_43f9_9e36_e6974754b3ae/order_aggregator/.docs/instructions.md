Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Decentralized Order Book Aggregation**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a decentralized order book aggregator.  In a decentralized exchange (DEX) environment, order books are often fragmented across multiple independent nodes or shards. Your goal is to efficiently aggregate these fragmented order books to provide a unified view of the market.

Specifically, you will receive order book data from `N` different nodes. Each node's order book contains a list of limit orders, represented as tuples of `(price, quantity, nodeID)`. The `nodeID` is a unique identifier for the node that originated the order.  The order books from each node are sorted by price (ascending for buy orders, descending for sell orders).

Your task is to write a function, `AggregateOrderBook`, that takes as input a slice of order books (one for each node) and an aggregation depth `K`.  The function should return the top `K` buy orders and the top `K` sell orders, aggregated from all the input order books.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

1.  **Data Structures:**  You must use efficient data structures to store and manipulate the order book data. Consider the trade-offs between different data structures in terms of performance.

2.  **Efficiency:** The `AggregateOrderBook` function must be optimized for both time and space complexity.  The number of nodes (`N`) and the aggregation depth (`K`) can be large (e.g., `N <= 1000`, `K <= 10000`). The number of orders in each node's orderbook could be large as well. Strive for a solution with a time complexity better than O(N * M * K) where M is the maximum length of each node's orderbook.

3.  **Real-time Updates:** Assume that the order books are updated frequently.  While you don't need to handle actual real-time updates, your solution should be designed in a way that makes it amenable to future integration with a real-time data stream (e.g., consider using channels or other concurrency primitives).

4.  **Tie-breaking:** If there are multiple orders with the same price, prioritize orders from nodes with lower `nodeID`.

5.  **No External Libraries (Except `container/heap`):**  You are allowed to use the `container/heap` package from the Go standard library, but no other external libraries are permitted. This encourages you to understand and implement the core algorithms yourself.

6.  **Edge Cases:**  Handle edge cases such as empty order books, `K` being larger than the total number of orders, and duplicate orders with the same price and quantity.

7.  **Memory Management:**  Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large order books. Avoid unnecessary copying of data.

8.  **Concurrency:**  While strict concurrency isn't *required* for a base solution, consider how your algorithm could be parallelized to improve performance, and clearly document any concurrency considerations.

**Input:**

*   `orderBooks`: A `[]([](price float64, quantity int, nodeID int))` where each inner slice represents the order book for a single node.
*   `K`: An integer representing the aggregation depth (the number of top buy/sell orders to return).

**Output:**

*   `topBuyOrders`: A `[]([]float64, int, int))` representing the top `K` buy orders, sorted by price in descending order.
*   `topSellOrders`: A `[]([]float64, int, int))` representing the top `K` sell orders, sorted by price in ascending order.

**Example:**

```go
orderBooks := [][]struct {
    Price    float64
    Quantity int
    NodeID   int
}{
    {{Price: 10.0, Quantity: 5, NodeID: 1}, {Price: 9.5, Quantity: 3, NodeID: 1}}, // Node 1
    {{Price: 10.5, Quantity: 2, NodeID: 2}, {Price: 9.8, Quantity: 4, NodeID: 2}}, // Node 2
}
K := 2

topBuyOrders, topSellOrders := AggregateOrderBook(orderBooks, K)

// Expected topBuyOrders (order matters):
//  {{Price: 10.5, Quantity: 2, NodeID: 2}, {Price: 10.0, Quantity: 5, NodeID: 1}}

// Expected topSellOrders (order matters):
// {{Price: 9.5, Quantity: 3, NodeID: 1}, {Price: 9.8, Quantity: 4, NodeID: 2}}
```

This problem combines algorithmic efficiency, data structure choices, and real-world considerations, making it a challenging and sophisticated Go programming exercise. Good luck!

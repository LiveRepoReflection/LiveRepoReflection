## Problem: Optimizing Inter-Service Call Chains

**Description:**

You are designing a microservice architecture for an e-commerce platform.  The platform consists of several independent services, including: `ProductCatalog`, `Inventory`, `Pricing`, `Recommendation`, and `Order`. A critical workflow involves displaying product details to a user, which requires querying multiple services.

Specifically, to render a product details page, the following sequence of service calls is typically made:

1.  `ProductCatalog.GetProduct(productID)`: Retrieves basic product information (name, description, etc.).
2.  `Inventory.GetStockLevel(productID)`: Retrieves the current stock level for the product.
3.  `Pricing.GetPrice(productID, userID)`: Retrieves the price of the product, potentially personalized for the user.
4.  `Recommendation.GetRelatedProducts(productID)`: Retrieves a list of related products to display.

Each service call has an associated cost, represented as a floating-point number (e.g., CPU usage, network latency, database queries, etc.).  These costs are not fixed and can vary depending on various factors (e.g., load, database performance, network conditions). You are provided with a snapshot of the cost matrix between services.  The cost matrix `C[i][j]` represents the cost of calling service `j` *immediately* after calling service `i`. If `i` is the starting service (before any calls have been made), `C[0][j]` represents the cost of the initial call to service `j`.

Your task is to write a Go program that determines the *minimum cost* to complete the product details workflow, given the cost matrix `C` and the required sequence of service calls.  However, there's a crucial constraint:  **You must minimize the *total cost*, not just the cost of the calls in the specified order.  This means you can re-order the calls to the services in the workflow to find the optimal execution path.**

**Input:**

*   A 2D slice (matrix) of floats `C` representing the cost matrix.  The matrix will have dimensions (N+1) x N, where N is the number of services in the workflow.  The first row `C[0]` represents the cost of the initial call to each service.  The remaining rows `C[i]` (where `i > 0`) represent the cost of calling service `j` after calling service `i`.
*   A slice of integers `requiredServices` representing the indices of the services that *must* be called to satisfy the workflow requirements.  The indices correspond to the columns in the cost matrix `C`.  The order of services in `requiredServices` is *not* necessarily the optimal execution order. The service indices will be between `0` and `N-1` inclusive.
*   An integer `N` representing the number of services.

**Output:**

*   A float representing the minimum total cost to complete the workflow, considering all possible orderings of the required service calls.  Return `-1.0` if a valid path cannot be found (e.g., invalid input).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10` (Number of services)
*   `1 <= len(requiredServices) <= N`
*   All costs in the cost matrix `C` are non-negative floats.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient.  Brute-force approaches that enumerate all permutations may not be efficient enough for larger values of `N`.  Consider using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques.
*   The `requiredServices` slice will contain unique service indices.
*   The input cost matrix `C` is guaranteed to be valid and will have the correct dimensions.
*   The solution should handle edge cases gracefully, such as an empty `requiredServices` slice.

**Example:**

```
C = [][]float64{
    {1.0, 2.0, 3.0},  // Initial call costs
    {0.0, 4.0, 5.0},  // Cost of calling service after service 0
    {6.0, 0.0, 7.0},  // Cost of calling service after service 1
    {8.0, 9.0, 0.0},  // Cost of calling service after service 2
}
requiredServices = []int{0, 1, 2} // Must call all three services
N = 3

Output: 14.0 (One possible optimal path: 1.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 = 14.0. This corresponds to services 0 -> 1 -> 2.)

```

**Challenge:**

The core challenge is to efficiently explore the permutation space of the `requiredServices` to find the ordering that minimizes the total cost, given the inter-service call costs represented in the cost matrix `C`. The relatively small constraint on `N` is misleading; a naive permutation approach will still likely time out for `N=10` given tight time constraints during judging. The "cost" of each service call depends on the *previous* service called; you must consider that dependency in your algorithm.

Good luck!

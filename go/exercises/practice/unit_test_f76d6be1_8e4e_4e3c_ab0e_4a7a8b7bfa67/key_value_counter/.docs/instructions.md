`DistributedKeyCounter`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed key-value counter service. This service should efficiently count the occurrences of keys across a cluster of machines.  The service must handle a high volume of requests, be fault-tolerant, and provide consistent counts.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **Incrementing Counts:**  The service should provide an `Increment(key string)` function that atomically increments the count associated with a given key.  This function should be highly concurrent and distributed.
2.  **Retrieving Counts:** The service should provide a `GetCount(key string)` function that returns the current count for a given key. The returned count should be consistent, reflecting all increment operations that have completed before the `GetCount` request.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The service should be resilient to machine failures.  If one or more machines in the cluster fail, the service should continue to operate and provide accurate counts.  Data loss should be minimized.
4.  **Scalability:** The service should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing request volumes and data sizes. Adding more machines to the cluster should increase the service's capacity.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Data Distribution:** Counts should be distributed across multiple machines to avoid single points of failure and to improve performance. Consider using consistent hashing or similar techniques.
*   **Concurrency Control:** You must ensure that increment operations are atomic and that concurrent increment requests for the same key are handled correctly.  Avoid race conditions and ensure data integrity.
*   **Consistency:** While strong consistency is desirable, aim for eventual consistency with mechanisms to minimize the window of inconsistency.  Explain the consistency model your service provides.
*   **Fault Detection:** Implement a mechanism for detecting failed machines.
*   **Data Replication:** Counts should be replicated across multiple machines to provide fault tolerance.  Consider the trade-offs between replication factor, consistency, and performance.
*   **Optimization:** Optimize for both read and write performance. The service should be able to handle a large number of increment requests with low latency, while also providing reasonably fast count retrieval.
*   **Resource Limits:** Assume each machine in the cluster has limited memory and CPU resources. The solution should be designed to minimize resource consumption. Consider techniques like sharding and data compression.
*   **Cluster Size:** The cluster size can vary from a small number of machines (e.g., 3) to a large number (e.g., 100 or more). Your solution should be able to handle a wide range of cluster sizes.
*   **Key Space:** Assume a very large key space (potentially millions or billions of unique keys).
*   **Eventual Consistency Tradeoff:**  The `GetCount` operation may not reflect the absolute latest increments in some cases of network partitions or temporary node failures, you can assume clients can tolerate this behavior.

**Considerations:**

*   **Choice of Technologies:** You are free to use any appropriate libraries or frameworks in Go (e.g., gRPC for communication, a distributed consensus algorithm like Raft or Paxos for consistency, a key-value store like Redis or etcd for data storage). Justify your choices.
*   **Complexity Trade-offs:**  There are multiple valid approaches to solving this problem, each with different trade-offs in terms of complexity, performance, and fault tolerance.  Explain the trade-offs you considered and justify your design decisions.
*   **Failure Scenarios:**  Consider various failure scenarios (e.g., network partitions, machine crashes, data corruption) and explain how your service handles them.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, fault tolerance, and data consistency. A well-designed solution will demonstrate the ability to balance these competing concerns to create a robust and scalable key-value counter service. You are being evaluated on the correctness, efficiency, fault-tolerance, scalability, and explainability of your solution. You should provide detailed comments on each stage to show your understanding of the problem.

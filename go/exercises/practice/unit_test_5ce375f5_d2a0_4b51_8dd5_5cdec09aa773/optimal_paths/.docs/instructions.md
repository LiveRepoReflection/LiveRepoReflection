Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkPaths`

**Question Description:**

You are given a large communication network represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents a server, and each directed edge represents a communication link between two servers.  Each communication link has a *cost* associated with it, representing the latency of sending data across that link.

The network is prone to failures. At any given time, a certain number of servers may be temporarily unavailable.

Your task is to design a system that can efficiently answer queries about the optimal (least cost) path between two servers in the network, given a list of unavailable servers.

**Specifically, you need to implement a function `FindOptimalPath(graph Graph, startServerID int, endServerID int, unavailableServerIDs []int) ([]int, int) {}` which returns:**

*   A list of server IDs representing the optimal path (sequence of servers to traverse) from `startServerID` to `endServerID`.
*   The total cost of that path.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The `Graph` will be represented as a standard adjacency list (or similar efficient representation) where each node contains a server ID and a list of outgoing edges. Each edge will contain a destination server ID and an associated cost.  You are free to define the exact `Graph` and `Edge` structs/types in your solution.
2.  **Large Network:** The network can be very large, containing up to 100,000 servers and millions of links.
3.  **Real-time Queries:** The queries need to be answered efficiently. The target is to handle a large number of queries with low latency. Optimize your pathfinding algorithm and data structures to minimize query response time.
4.  **Unavailable Servers:** The `unavailableServerIDs` list can contain a significant number of servers (up to 10,000).  The pathfinding algorithm *must* avoid traversing any unavailable server.
5.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle the case where `startServerID` or `endServerID` is in the `unavailableServerIDs` list.  Return an empty path and a cost of -1 to indicate no valid path exists.
    *   Handle the case where no path exists between `startServerID` and `endServerID` given the unavailable servers. Return an empty path and a cost of -1.
    *   Handle the case where `startServerID` and `endServerID` are the same, and the server is available. Return a path containing only the `startServerID` and a cost of 0.
6.  **Optimization:**  Consider using techniques like pre-computation (if applicable and beneficial), optimized priority queues for pathfinding, and efficient data structures for checking server availability.  The performance characteristics of your chosen algorithm and data structures will be critical.
7.  **Multiple Valid Paths:** If multiple optimal paths exist (paths with the same minimum cost), you can return any one of them.
8.  **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially given the large network size.  Avoid excessive memory allocation.
9. **Concurrency**: The function must be thread-safe. Assume that multiple goroutines may call this function concurrently with different input parameters.
10. **Error Handling**: The function should not panic. Any unexpected condition should be handled gracefully and returned as an empty path and a cost of -1.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:**  The algorithm must correctly find the optimal path (or determine that no path exists).
*   **Efficiency:**  The solution must be able to handle a large number of queries on a large network within a reasonable time limit.  The efficiency of the pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's, A\*) and data structures will be critical.  Consider both time and space complexity.
*   **Code Quality:**  The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Handling of Edge Cases:** The solution must correctly handle all specified edge cases.
*   **Concurrency Safety**: The solution should be thread-safe.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

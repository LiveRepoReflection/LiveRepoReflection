## The Quantum Circuit Optimizer

**Problem Description:**

You are working for a cutting-edge quantum computing company. A key component of their quantum processing unit (QPU) is a circuit optimizer. Quantum circuits are sequences of quantum gates that operate on qubits. Different sequences of gates can achieve the same logical operation. Your task is to write a quantum circuit optimizer that finds the shortest sequence of gates to achieve a desired transformation.

A quantum circuit is represented as a sequence of gates acting on a set of qubits. Each gate has a specific type and acts on specific qubits. The goal is to find the shortest sequence of gates that transforms the initial quantum state into the target quantum state.

**Input:**

*   `numQubits`: An integer representing the number of qubits in the quantum circuit (e.g., 2, 3, 4).
*   `initialState`: A string representing the initial quantum state in binary format (e.g., "00", "101").
*   `targetState`: A string representing the target quantum state in binary format (e.g., "11", "010").
*   `gates`: A slice of structs, where each struct represents a quantum gate.  Each gate struct has the following fields:
    *   `name`: A string representing the name of the gate (e.g., "X", "CNOT").
    *   `qubits`: A slice of integers representing the qubits the gate acts on (e.g., `[]int{0}`, `[]int{0, 1}`).  Qubit indices are 0-based.
    *   `matrix`: A 2D slice of complex128 numbers representing the gate's unitary transformation matrix. The matrix will always be a square matrix of size 2^n x 2^n where n is the number of qubits the gate acts on. The matrix will also be a unitary matrix.

**Output:**

*   A slice of structs, where each struct represents a gate from the `gates` input. The slice of gates represents the shortest sequence of gates that transforms the `initialState` to the `targetState`. If no such sequence exists, return an empty slice.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numQubits <= 5`
*   The length of `initialState` and `targetState` must be equal to `numQubits`.
*   `initialState` and `targetState` must contain only '0' and '1' characters.
*   The number of gates in the `gates` slice can be large (up to 100).
*   The qubits acted on by each gate must be within the range `[0, numQubits-1]`.
*   The gate matrices are unitary.
*   The solution must find the *shortest* possible sequence of gates. If multiple shortest sequences exist, return any one of them.
*   The maximum length of the gate sequence should not exceed 10. If no solution can be found with 10 or fewer gates, return an empty slice.
*   The code must be optimized for performance. Brute-force approaches will likely time out.

**Complexities to Consider:**

*   **State Representation:** Efficiently represent quantum states (e.g., using complex number vectors).
*   **Gate Application:** Implement a function to apply a quantum gate (represented by its matrix) to a quantum state vector.  This requires tensor products.
*   **Search Algorithm:** Design an efficient search algorithm to explore the possible gate sequences (e.g., Breadth-First Search (BFS) or A\* search, potentially with heuristics).
*   **State Comparison:** Implement a function to compare quantum states, accounting for potential global phase differences (multiplying the entire state vector by a complex number of magnitude 1 doesn't change the physical state).
*   **Memory Management:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large state vectors and numerous gate sequences.
*   **Optimizations:** Consider techniques to prune the search space, such as detecting and eliminating redundant gate sequences.

This problem combines elements of graph search, linear algebra (matrix operations), and numerical computation (complex numbers), all within the context of quantum computing. The constraints on the number of qubits and gate sequence length are designed to make the problem challenging but solvable within reasonable time limits. The need for efficient algorithms and optimizations makes this a hard-level problem.

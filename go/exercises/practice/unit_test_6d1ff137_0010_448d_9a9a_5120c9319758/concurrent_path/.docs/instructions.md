Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem.

### Project Name

```
Concurrent Shortest Path
```

### Question Description

You are given a weighted, directed graph represented as an adjacency list. The graph can be very large (millions of nodes and edges) and is expected to be sparse.  Each edge has an associated weight (a positive integer).

Your task is to implement a concurrent algorithm to find the shortest path from a given source node to a given destination node.

**Input:**

*   `numNodes`: The total number of nodes in the graph (nodes are numbered from 0 to `numNodes`-1).
*   `graph`: A `map[int][]Edge` representing the adjacency list. The keys are node IDs, and the values are slices of `Edge` structs, representing outgoing edges from that node.
*   `source`: The ID of the source node.
*   `destination`: The ID of the destination node.

**Edge struct:**

```go
type Edge struct {
    To     int
    Weight int
}
```

**Output:**

*   Return an `[]int` representing the nodes on the shortest path from `source` to `destination`, in order (inclusive of source and destination). If no path exists, return an empty slice `[]int{}`.  If the source and destination are the same, return `[]int{source}`.
*   If multiple shortest paths exist, return *any* one of them.
*   Return an error if the source or destination node does not exist.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

1.  **Concurrency:** Your solution *must* leverage Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) to explore the graph in parallel. A sequential solution will not be accepted, even if correct. The goal is to exploit parallelism to reduce the overall execution time.
2.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be as efficient as possible in terms of both time and memory.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize redundant computations.  Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search (if you want to get *really* ambitious) are suitable choices, but *must* be implemented concurrently.
3.  **Scalability:**  The solution should scale reasonably well with the size of the graph and the number of available CPU cores. Avoid creating excessive numbers of goroutines, as this can lead to overhead that outweighs the benefits of parallelism.
4.  **Error Handling:** The function should handle invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-existent source or destination nodes, or negative edge weights.
5.  **Deadlock Avoidance:**  The concurrent code *must* be free from deadlocks. Carefully design your channel communication patterns to ensure that goroutines do not block indefinitely waiting for each other.
6.  **Graph Structure:** The graph may contain cycles. Your algorithm must be able to handle cycles correctly and avoid infinite loops.
7.  **Large Graph:** The graph can be very large.  Avoid loading the entire graph into memory at once if possible.

**Example:**

```go
numNodes := 6
graph := map[int][]Edge{
    0: {{To: 1, Weight: 2}, {To: 2, Weight: 4}},
    1: {{To: 2, Weight: 1}, {To: 3, Weight: 7}},
    2: {{To: 3, Weight: 3}},
    3: {{To: 4, Weight: 1}, {To: 5, Weight: 5}},
    4: {},
    5: {},
}
source := 0
destination := 4

// A possible shortest path: [0 1 2 3 4]
// Another possible shortest path: [0 2 3 4]
// The weight of both is 9
shortestPath, err := FindShortestPath(numNodes, graph, source, destination)
```

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, concurrency in Go, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

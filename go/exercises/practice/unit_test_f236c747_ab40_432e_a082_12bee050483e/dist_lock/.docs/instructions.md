Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations.

### Project Name

`DistributedLocking`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed locking service. This service will be used by multiple independent applications running across a cluster of machines to coordinate access to shared resources (e.g., database rows, files on a distributed file system).  The service must guarantee mutual exclusion: only one application can hold the lock for a given resource at any time.

**Specifically, you need to implement the following functionality:**

1.  **`AcquireLock(resourceID string, leaseDuration time.Duration) (bool, error)`:** Attempts to acquire a lock for the given `resourceID`.
    *   If the lock is currently free, it should be acquired immediately. The `leaseDuration` specifies how long the lock should be held.
    *   If the lock is currently held by another application, the function should block until the lock becomes available or a timeout occurs (specified below).
    *   The function returns `true` if the lock was successfully acquired, `false` if the attempt timed out, and an `error` if any other error occurred.

2.  **`ReleaseLock(resourceID string) error`:** Releases the lock for the given `resourceID`. It is an error to release a lock that is not held, or held by another process.

3.  **`ExtendLock(resourceID string, newLeaseDuration time.Duration) (bool, error)`:** Extends the lease of an acquired lock.
    *   If the lock is held by the caller, the lease should be extended to the `newLeaseDuration`.
    *   If the lock is not held by the caller or does not exist, the function should return `false` and a nil error.  If any other error occurs, return false and the error.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The distributed locking service must remain operational even if some of its underlying nodes fail.

5.  **Concurrency:** The service must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent lock requests.

6.  **Prevent Deadlocks:**  Implement a mechanism to prevent deadlocks.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Resource IDs:**  Resource IDs are arbitrary strings.
*   **Lease Durations:**  Lease durations are specified using the `time.Duration` type.
*   **Timeout:** The maximum time to wait for lock acquisition should be configurable.
*   **Distributed Consensus:**  You can use a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) as the underlying mechanism for ensuring consistency and fault tolerance. However, you do not need to implement the consensus algorithm from scratch. Assume you have access to a library or service that provides this functionality (e.g., etcd, Consul, ZooKeeper). *Focus on the locking logic around it.*
*   **Efficiency:** Optimize for low latency in lock acquisition and release.  Consider the trade-offs between consistency and performance.
*   **Reentrancy:** Locks are *not* reentrant. A single application cannot acquire the same lock multiple times without releasing it first.
*   **Starvation:**  While perfect fairness isn't required, the design should attempt to minimize the risk of starvation (where one application is consistently unable to acquire a lock).

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Structures:** Think carefully about how to store lock information (e.g., the resource ID, the current holder of the lock, the lease expiration time) in a way that is efficient for querying and updating.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle potential errors gracefully, such as network failures, timeouts, and invalid requests.
*   **Testing:** Consider how you would thoroughly test the distributed locking service to ensure its correctness and reliability under various failure scenarios.
*   **Scalability:** How well would your design scale as the number of applications and resources increases?

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and data structures. Efficient and well-tested code is crucial. Good luck!

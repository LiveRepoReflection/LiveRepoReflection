Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description:

**Project Name:** Network Congestion Control

**Question Description:**

You are designing a network congestion control algorithm. You are given a network represented as a directed graph where nodes are routers and edges are communication links. Each link has a capacity representing the maximum data rate it can handle.

The network operator needs to route data packets from a source node to a destination node. Due to varying network conditions and malicious actors, the link capacities can fluctuate unpredictably within a known range. Specifically, each link *e* has a minimum capacity *min_cap(e)* and a maximum capacity *max_cap(e)*. The actual capacity at any given time is a value between these bounds, inclusive.

Your task is to implement an algorithm that can *dynamically* adjust the data transmission rate from the source to the destination to avoid network congestion.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The network is represented as a directed graph. You will receive the graph as an adjacency list, where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors, along with the `min_cap` and `max_cap` for each edge.

2.  **Capacity Updates:** The capacity of each link can change randomly within the specified `min_cap` and `max_cap` at any time. Your algorithm should be able to adapt to these changes. The capacity changes will be provided as a stream of updates, each specifying the link (source node, destination node) and the new capacity.

3.  **Congestion Avoidance:** You must implement a mechanism to detect and avoid network congestion. Congestion occurs when the total data flow through any link exceeds its current capacity. When congestion is detected, your algorithm must reduce the data transmission rate to a safe level that prevents the congestion from worsening.

4.  **Maximizing Throughput:** While avoiding congestion, your algorithm should also aim to maximize the data transmission rate from the source to the destination.

5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The data transmission rate should be dynamically adjusted based on the current network conditions. You should not rely on precomputed routes or static rate assignments.

6.  **Fairness (Important):** If multiple paths exist between the source and destination, your algorithm should ensure that the data flow is distributed relatively fairly among these paths. Avoid situations where one path is heavily utilized while others are underutilized, even if that means momentarily accepting a slightly lower throughput.

7.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It should be able to handle large networks with thousands of nodes and edges. Updating the data rate should be fast, as the network conditions can change rapidly. The algorithm should also avoid using excessive memory.

**Input:**

*   `num_nodes`: The number of nodes in the network. Nodes are numbered from 0 to `num_nodes - 1`.
*   `graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph. The keys are node IDs (integers), and the values are lists of `Edge` structs.
    The `Edge` struct contains `destination`, `min_cap`, and `max_cap` fields.
*   `source`: The ID of the source node (integer).
*   `destination`: The ID of the destination node (integer).
*   A stream of capacity updates, each specifying a link (source node, destination node) and the new capacity.
*   The updates will be provided in the form of a channel of `CapacityUpdate` structs.
    The `CapacityUpdate` struct contains `source`, `destination`, and `new_capacity` fields.

**Output:**

The algorithm should output the current data transmission rate from the source to the destination after each capacity update. The rate should be a floating-point number representing the number of data units transmitted per unit of time.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the network can be up to 10,000.
*   The number of edges in the network can be up to 100,000.
*   The minimum and maximum capacities of each link can range from 1 to 1,000,000.
*   The algorithm must be able to handle a high rate of capacity updates (e.g., 100 updates per second).
*   Memory usage should be limited.

**Example:**

(A simplified example to illustrate the concept. The real test cases will be much more complex.)

```go
type Edge struct {
    Destination int
    MinCapacity float64
    MaxCapacity float64
}

type CapacityUpdate struct {
    Source      int
    Destination int
    NewCapacity float64
}

func congestionControl(num_nodes int, graph map[int][]Edge, source int, destination int, updates <-chan CapacityUpdate) float64 {
    // Your code here.
    // Dynamically adjust data rate based on capacity updates.
    // Avoid congestion and maximize throughput.
    // Implement fairness among multiple paths.
    return 0.0 // Return the current data transmission rate.
}
```

**Grading:**

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The algorithm must correctly avoid network congestion and ensure that the data flow does not exceed the capacity of any link.
*   **Throughput:** The algorithm should maximize the data transmission rate from the source to the destination.
*   **Fairness:** The algorithm should distribute the data flow fairly among multiple paths.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
*   **Robustness:** The algorithm should be robust to handle various network topologies and capacity update patterns.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a combination of graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Ford-Fulkerson algorithm) and control theory techniques (e.g., PID controllers) to solve this problem.
*   Implement a feedback mechanism to monitor the network conditions and adjust the data transmission rate accordingly.
*   Use appropriate data structures to store the network topology and capacity information.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph theory, network algorithms, and control systems. It also requires careful attention to detail to handle the various edge cases and constraints. Good luck!

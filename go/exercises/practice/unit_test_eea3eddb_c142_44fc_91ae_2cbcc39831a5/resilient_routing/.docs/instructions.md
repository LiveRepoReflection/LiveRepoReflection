Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a range of skills.

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a resilient routing algorithm for a distributed network. The network consists of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.  Each node can communicate directly with a subset of other nodes.  This network is prone to failures: links between nodes can become temporarily unavailable. Your goal is to design a routing algorithm that can efficiently find the shortest path between any two nodes in the presence of these temporary link failures.

Specifically, you are given:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges`: A list of bidirectional connections between nodes represented as `[][]int`. Each inner slice `[u, v, w]` represents an edge between node `u` and node `v` with weight `w`.
*   `queries`: A list of routing requests represented as `[][]int`. Each inner slice `[start, end, k]` represents a request to find the shortest path from node `start` to node `end` that is resilient to `k` link failures.

Your task is to implement a function that takes `N`, `edges`, and `queries` as input and returns a list of the shortest path costs (sum of edge weights) for each query. If no path exists between the start and end nodes for a given query, return `-1` for that query.

**Constraints:**

*   The network is undirected. If `[u, v, w]` exists in `edges`, `[v, u, w]` is implicitly assumed.
*   Node IDs are integers from `0` to `N-1`.
*   Edge weights are non-negative integers.
*   The network may not be fully connected.
*   The same edge will not appear multiple times in `edges`.
*   The number of potential failed edges `k` in each query can range from `0` to a reasonable fraction of the total edges, but specifically, it is guaranteed that `k` will not be greater than the total number of edges in the network.
*   The shortest path must be resilient to *any* combination of `k` edge failures.  That is, the chosen path must still be the shortest path *regardless* of which `k` edges fail.
*   Efficiency is critical. The input network and number of queries can be large.  Consider algorithmic complexity and the impact of data structure choices on performance.
*   Assume that edge failures are temporary and do not permanently alter the underlying network topology for subsequent queries. Each query should be processed independently based on the initial network state.
*   The problem focuses on finding the cost (sum of edge weights) of the shortest path, not the path itself.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
edges = [][]int{{0, 1, 1}, {0, 2, 5}, {1, 2, 2}, {1, 3, 1}, {2, 3, 4}}
queries = [][]int{{0, 3, 0}, {0, 3, 1}}
```

For the first query `[0, 3, 0]`, we need the shortest path from 0 to 3 with no failures allowed. The shortest path is 0 -> 1 -> 3 with a cost of 1 + 1 = 2.

For the second query `[0, 3, 1]`, we need the shortest path from 0 to 3 resilient to 1 failure. We need a path that remains the shortest even if any single edge fails.
* The path 0 -> 1 -> 3 (cost 2) fails if edge 0-1 or 1-3 fails.
* The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 (cost 9) fails if edge 0-2 or 2-3 fails.
* Let's consider paths of length 3 or greater. The path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 has cost 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. If edge 1-2 fails, the path is broken.

So, the path 0 -> 1 -> 3 is optimal for the first query.

**Requirements:**

Implement the following function in Go:

```go
func ResilientNetworkRouting(N int, edges [][]int, queries [][]int) []int {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

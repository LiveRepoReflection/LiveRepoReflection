Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem.

**Project Name:** `ScalableTrafficAnalysis`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for analyzing network traffic logs in real-time. The system receives a continuous stream of log entries, each representing a network flow. Each log entry contains the following information:

*   `timestamp` (Unix timestamp in seconds): The time the flow occurred.
*   `source_ip` (string): The source IP address of the flow.
*   `destination_ip` (string): The destination IP address of the flow.
*   `bytes_transferred` (integer): The number of bytes transferred during the flow.

Your system must efficiently answer the following types of queries:

1.  **TopKDestinationIPs(startTime, endTime, k):** Returns the `k` most frequent destination IP addresses within the specified time range (`startTime` and `endTime` are Unix timestamps in seconds).  The result should be a slice of strings, sorted by frequency in descending order (most frequent first). In case of ties, sort alphabetically ascending.
2.  **AverageBytesTransferred(ip, startTime, endTime):**  Returns the average number of bytes transferred for flows originating from a given IP address (`ip`) within the specified time range. If there are no flows from that IP in the time range, return 0.0.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to handle a very high volume of log entries (millions per second). Consider how to design your data structures and algorithms to minimize memory usage and maximize throughput.
*   **Real-time Performance:** Queries should be answered as quickly as possible.  Optimize for low latency.
*   **Time Range Queries:** The system should efficiently handle queries with arbitrary time ranges.
*   **Memory Usage:**  The system should minimize memory consumption.  You may need to consider techniques like data summarization or sampling if memory becomes a bottleneck.
*   **Data Persistence (Optional but encouraged):** While not strictly required for the core functionality, consider how you might persist the data to disk for later analysis or recovery in case of system failure.  This could involve using a database or writing to files.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Empty log stream.
*   Invalid timestamps (e.g., `startTime` > `endTime`).
*   Large `k` values in `TopKDestinationIPs` (larger than the number of distinct destination IPs).
*   Sudden spikes in traffic volume.
*   Handling of invalid IP addresses in the logs.

**Implementation Details:**

*   You should implement a `TrafficAnalyzer` struct with methods for ingesting log entries and answering queries.
*   Log entries are ingested via an `IngestLogEntry(timestamp, sourceIP, destinationIP, bytesTransferred)` method.
*   The `TopKDestinationIPs` and `AverageBytesTransferred` methods should be implemented as described above.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the implementation.
*   Efficiency of query processing (latency).
*   Scalability of the system (throughput).
*   Memory usage.
*   Code quality (readability, maintainability, and adherence to Go best practices).
*   Handling of edge cases.
*   Consideration of data persistence (if implemented).

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. It rewards optimized solutions that can handle real-world traffic volumes efficiently. Good luck!

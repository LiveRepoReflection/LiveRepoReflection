Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult, akin to a LeetCode Hard problem, incorporating several of your suggested elements:

## Project Name

`IntergalacticNetworkOptimization`

## Question Description

The Intergalactic Federation is building a new communication network to connect its `N` planets. Due to the vast distances involved, they plan to use a combination of direct laser links and wormholes.

*   **Laser Links:** Building a direct laser link between two planets `i` and `j` incurs a cost of `cost[i][j]`, where `cost[i][j]` is the Euclidean distance between the planets.

*   **Wormholes:** Wormholes can instantly connect any two planets, regardless of their distance. However, each wormhole requires a significant amount of exotic matter to stabilize. The Federation has a limited budget for exotic matter, allowing them to create at most `K` wormholes.

Your task is to determine the *minimum total cost* to connect all `N` planets in the network, considering the cost of laser links and the limited availability of wormholes. Two planets are considered connected if there is a path (direct or indirect) between them using laser links and/or wormholes.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of planets (numbered from `0` to `N-1`).
*   `K`: The maximum number of wormholes allowed.
*   `coordinates`: A `[][]int` slice where `coordinates[i]` represents the `(x, y)` coordinates of planet `i`. `coordinates[i][0]` is the x-coordinate and `coordinates[i][1]` is the y-coordinate.
*   `cost`: A `[][]float64` slice where `cost[i][j]` represents the Euclidean distance between the planets.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `0 <= K <= N - 1`
*   `-10^5 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^5`
*   The coordinates of all planets are distinct.
*   The cost matrix is symmetric, i.e., `cost[i][j] == cost[j][i]`.
*   You can assume that the cost matrix has already been precalculated (Euclidean distance between planets) and is provided as input.

**Output:**

*   Return a `float64` representing the minimum cost to connect all planets.

**Requirements and Considerations:**

*   **Optimization:** The solution must be computationally efficient. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.
*   **Data Structures:** Consider using appropriate data structures like Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms (Prim's or Kruskal's).
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where `K = 0` (no wormholes allowed) and `K = N - 1` (enough wormholes to connect all planets directly if that is cheaper).
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Aim for a time complexity of `O(N^2 log N)` or better.
*   **Multiple Valid Approaches:** There might be multiple approaches to solve this problem, each with its own trade-offs in terms of time and space complexity. You should choose the approach that provides the best balance for the given constraints.
*   **Real-world scenario:** This problem is inspired by network optimization scenarios found in real-world scenarios, where resources are limited (wormholes are limited by the available exotic matter).
*   **System Design Aspects:** Consider the scalability of your solution if the number of planets were much larger. Could you optimize the precalculation of distances and the subsequent MST computation?

This problem combines graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful handling of constraints, making it a significant challenge. Good luck!

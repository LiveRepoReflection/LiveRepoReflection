Scalable Social Graph Analytics

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for performing analytics on a very large social graph. The graph represents users and their connections (friendships). The system needs to handle a massive influx of new users and connections, as well as efficiently answer complex analytical queries.

The system should provide the following functionalities:

1.  **Ingestion**: Efficiently process a stream of user and connection data.
    *   User data consists of `(userID, userMetadata)` pairs. `userID` is a unique integer, and `userMetadata` is a string (e.g., user profile information).
    *   Connection data consists of `(userID1, userID2)` pairs, representing a friendship between the two users. The graph is undirected (if A is a friend of B, then B is a friend of A).
    *   The system must handle duplicate connection entries gracefully (i.e., adding the same friendship multiple times should not create duplicate edges).

2.  **Query 1: Degree Distribution**: Calculate the degree distribution of the graph. The degree of a node is the number of connections it has. The degree distribution should be represented as a map where the key is the degree and the value is the number of nodes with that degree.

3.  **Query 2: Connected Components**: Find the number of connected components in the graph. A connected component is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by a path.

4.  **Query 3: Personalized PageRank**: Given a source `userID` and a number `k`, calculate the top `k` users with the highest personalized PageRank score from the perspective of the source user. Personalized PageRank simulates a random walk starting from the source user.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability**: The system should be designed to handle billions of users and connections.
*   **Real-time Ingestion**: The system should be able to ingest new user and connection data in real-time with minimal latency.
*   **Query Efficiency**: The queries should be answered efficiently, with reasonable response times even for large graphs.
*   **Concurrency**:  The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent ingestion and query requests correctly.
*   **Memory Usage**:  Memory usage should be optimized to avoid out-of-memory errors.  Consider using data structures that minimize memory footprint.
*   **Error Handling**: The system should handle invalid input data gracefully and provide informative error messages. For instance, querying for a user that doesn't exist, or using invalid parameters should return an appropriate error.

**Specific Challenges:**

*   Choose appropriate data structures for representing the graph to balance memory usage and query performance.  Consider adjacency lists, sparse matrices, or other optimized graph representations.
*   Implement efficient algorithms for calculating degree distribution, connected components, and personalized PageRank.  Consider parallelizing these algorithms to improve performance.
*   Design a system that can handle a continuous stream of data and query requests concurrently without compromising performance or data integrity.
*   Address the "cold start" problem: How does your system perform with very few initial users/connections?  How quickly does it converge to accurate results as more data is ingested?

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, concurrency, and system design principles. You'll need to make informed trade-offs to meet the performance and scalability requirements.

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description, aiming for a LeetCode Hard difficulty level.

**Project Name:** `EfficientRoutePlanner`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient route planner for a delivery service operating in a densely populated urban environment. The city can be represented as a weighted, directed graph. Each intersection in the city is a node in the graph, and each street segment connecting two intersections is a directed edge. The weight of an edge represents the time (in seconds) it takes to traverse that street segment.

Your system receives a series of delivery requests. Each request specifies:

*   A starting intersection (`startNodeId`).
*   A destination intersection (`endNodeId`).
*   A delivery deadline (`deadline`). This is the maximum time (in seconds) allowed for the delivery to be completed.
*   A penalty factor (`penalty`). The delivery service will face a penalty if the delivery is late, which should be calculated by `penalty * (actual_time - deadline)`.

You need to implement a route planning service that, for each delivery request, determines the optimal route (shortest time) that meets the following criteria:

1.  **Time Constraint:** The route must reach the destination *before* the `deadline`. If no such route exists, the service should return an error.
2.  **Dynamic Traffic:** The traffic conditions in the city are dynamic. At regular intervals, the weights (travel times) of some edges in the graph might change. Your route planner must be able to adapt to these changes in real-time and re-calculate routes efficiently. Specifically, you will be given a function to update the weight of one edge.

Your route planner must support the following operations:

*   `Initialize(graphData string)`: Initializes the route planner with the city graph data. The `graphData` string represents the graph in a specific format (details below). This function will be called only once at the start.
*   `FindOptimalRoute(startNodeId, endNodeId int, deadline int, penalty float64) (route []int, totalTime int, penaltyFee float64, error error)`:  Finds the optimal route from `startNodeId` to `endNodeId` that minimizes travel time while adhering to the `deadline`.  Returns the route as a slice of node IDs (in order of traversal), the total travel time, the penalty fee, and an error if no route satisfying the deadline exists.  If multiple routes have the same shortest time and meet the deadline, return any one of them.
*   `UpdateEdgeWeight(fromNodeId, toNodeId int, newWeight int)`: Updates the weight (travel time) of the edge from `fromNodeId` to `toNodeId` to `newWeight`.

**Graph Data Format (`graphData` string):**

The `graphData` string will be in the following format:

```
<num_nodes> <num_edges>
<from_node_id_1> <to_node_id_1> <weight_1>
<from_node_id_2> <to_node_id_2> <weight_2>
...
<from_node_id_n> <to_node_id_n> <weight_n>
```

*   `num_nodes`: The total number of nodes (intersections) in the graph. Nodes are numbered from 0 to `num_nodes - 1`.
*   `num_edges`: The total number of directed edges (street segments) in the graph.
*   `from_node_id`: The ID of the node where the edge starts.
*   `to_node_id`: The ID of the node where the edge ends.
*   `weight`: The time (in seconds) it takes to traverse the edge.

**Constraints:**

*   Number of nodes (intersections): Up to 10,000.
*   Number of edges (street segments): Up to 50,000.
*   Edge weights (travel times): Between 1 and 1000 seconds.
*   Delivery deadlines: Between 100 and 100,000 seconds.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Negative edge weights are not allowed.
*   The `UpdateEdgeWeight` function will be called frequently during the execution of tests. This requires a very quick method to avoid timeout issues.

**Performance Requirements:**

*   `FindOptimalRoute` should be reasonably efficient.  A naive Dijkstra's algorithm might not be fast enough for larger graphs. Consider using more advanced algorithms or data structures to optimize performance.
*   `UpdateEdgeWeight` must be extremely fast.  Recomputing the entire shortest-path graph after each update is not an option.
*   Memory usage should be reasonable.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   There may be no route between the start and end nodes.
*   The start and end nodes may be the same.
*   The deadline may be very small, making it difficult to find a feasible route.
*   The penalty factor could be zero.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The route planner must consistently find the optimal route (shortest time) that satisfies the deadline constraint.
*   Performance: The route planner must be able to handle large graphs and frequent edge weight updates within reasonable time limits.  Solutions will be penalized for slow performance.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Error Handling: The code should handle edge cases gracefully and return appropriate errors.

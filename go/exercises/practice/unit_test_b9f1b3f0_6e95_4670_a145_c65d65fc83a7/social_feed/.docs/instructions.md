Okay, I'm ready to set a truly challenging Go programming competition problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

`ScalableSocialGraph`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly scalable social graph service. This service needs to efficiently handle a massive number of users and their relationships (followers/following). The core functionality revolves around retrieving user feeds, which are ranked lists of posts from the users they follow.

**Requirements:**

1.  **User Relationships:** Implement functionality to add and remove follower/following relationships between users.

2.  **Post Creation:** Implement functionality for users to create posts. Each post has a timestamp, a user ID (the author), and content.

3.  **Feed Generation:** Implement a `GetUserFeed(userID, offset, limit)` function that retrieves a ranked feed of posts for a given user. The feed should include posts from all the users the given user follows, ranked primarily by timestamp (most recent first). Implement a secondary ranking criteria, which could include 'like' count or other signals that can be mocked or calculated from the post content.

4.  **Scalability:** The system must be designed to handle millions of users and billions of relationships. Strive for efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize latency and resource consumption. Consider sharding or other techniques to distribute the data and workload.

5.  **Real-time Updates:** Feeds should be updated relatively quickly when new posts are created by followed users. Aim for a reasonable balance between update latency and resource usage.

6.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to failures. Consider replication or other mechanisms to ensure data availability and service continuity.

7.  **API Design:** Define a clear and well-documented API for interacting with the service (e.g., using gRPC or REST).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of users can reach 10 million.
*   The number of relationships (followers/following) can reach 1 billion.
*   The number of posts can reach 10 billion.
*   The feed retrieval latency should be within a reasonable limit (e.g., < 200ms for a typical user with a moderate number of followed users).
*   Memory usage should be optimized to minimize costs.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Data Structure Selection:** Carefully choose data structures (e.g., adjacency lists, inverted indexes, specialized graph databases) to optimize for both read and write operations.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve feed retrieval performance. Consider both in-memory caching and distributed caching.
*   **Concurrency:** Utilize Go's concurrency features (goroutines, channels) to parallelize operations and improve throughput.
*   **Database Interactions:** Optimize database queries to minimize response times. Use appropriate indexes and query optimization techniques.
*   **Ranking Algorithm:** Design a ranking algorithm that is both accurate and efficient. Explore different ranking factors and their impact on performance.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The implementation must accurately generate feeds based on user relationships and post timestamps.
*   **Performance:** The system must meet the latency and throughput requirements under realistic load conditions.
*   **Scalability:** The design must be scalable to handle the specified number of users, relationships, and posts.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to failures and maintain data availability.
*   **Code Quality:** The code must be well-structured, documented, and maintainable.

This problem requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, system design, and Go's concurrency features. It encourages participants to think critically about trade-offs between performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

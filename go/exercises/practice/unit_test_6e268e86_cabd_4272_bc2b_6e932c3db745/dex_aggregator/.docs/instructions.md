Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be comparable to LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating the elements you requested.

**Problem Title:** Decentralized Order Book Aggregator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a component of a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. This aggregator needs to efficiently combine order book data from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to provide users with the best available prices for trading tokens.

Each DEX maintains its own order book, represented as a set of limit orders. A limit order specifies a price and quantity of a token to buy or sell.  Your aggregator receives a continuous stream of order book updates from `N` different DEXs.  Each update contains a DEX identifier, a token pair (e.g., "ETH/USDT"), and a list of order changes. An order change can be one of the following:

*   **Add:** A new limit order is placed on the DEX.
*   **Modify:** An existing limit order is updated with a new quantity.
*   **Remove:** An existing limit order is removed from the DEX.

Your task is to maintain an aggregated order book for a specific token pair (e.g., "ETH/USDT"). This aggregated order book should represent the top `K` best *bid* (buy) orders and the top `K` best *ask* (sell) orders across all DEXs.  "Best" bid orders have the *highest* price, while "best" ask orders have the *lowest* price.

You need to implement a system that can efficiently process these order book updates and return the aggregated top `K` bid and ask orders on demand.  The system should be designed to handle a high volume of updates with minimal latency.

**Input:**

*   A stream of order book updates. Each update is a struct containing:
    *   `DEXID`: A string representing the unique identifier of the DEX (e.g., "Uniswap", "SushiSwap").
    *   `TokenPair`: A string representing the token pair (e.g., "ETH/USDT").
    *   `Changes`: A slice of order change structs. Each order change struct contains:
        *   `Type`: An enum representing the type of change ("Add", "Modify", "Remove").
        *   `Price`: A float64 representing the price of the order.
        *   `Quantity`: A float64 representing the quantity of the order.
        *   `OrderID`: A unique string identifier for the order within the DEX.

*   `TokenPair`: A string representing the token pair to aggregate (e.g., "ETH/USDT").
*   `K`: An integer representing the number of top bid and ask orders to maintain.

**Output:**

*   A struct containing two slices:
    *   `Bids`: A slice of the top `K` bid orders, sorted in descending order by price.  Each bid order is a struct containing `Price` and `Quantity`.
    *   `Asks`: A slice of the top `K` ask orders, sorted in ascending order by price. Each ask order is a struct containing `Price` and `Quantity`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of DEXs, `N`, can be large (e.g., up to 100).
*   The volume of order book updates can be very high (e.g., thousands per second).
*   The value of `K` can range from 1 to 100.
*   Price and quantity are non-negative float64 numbers.
*   The system should be thread-safe and handle concurrent updates from different DEXs.
*   Minimize latency in processing updates and retrieving the aggregated order book.
*   Memory usage should be optimized.

**Considerations and Requirements:**

*   **Data Structures:**  Careful selection of data structures is crucial for performance. Consider using appropriate data structures for storing and maintaining the order books.  Heap-based structures could be useful for maintaining the top K bids and asks.
*   **Concurrency:**  Implement proper locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when handling concurrent updates. Consider using mutexes or channels to synchronize access to the order book data.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Handle edge cases such as empty order books, invalid input, and updates to non-existent orders.
*   **Optimization:**  Optimize the code for speed and memory usage.  Avoid unnecessary allocations and copies.
*   **Scalability:**  Design the system with scalability in mind.  Consider how the system would handle a larger number of DEXs and a higher volume of updates.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and ensure data consistency. Log errors appropriately.
*   **Real-world Practical Scenario:** Replicates a real-world DEX aggregation problem.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and concurrency to achieve optimal performance and scalability. Good luck!

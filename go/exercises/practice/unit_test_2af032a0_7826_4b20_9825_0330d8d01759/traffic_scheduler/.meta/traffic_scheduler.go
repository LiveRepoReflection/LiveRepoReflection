package traffic_scheduler

// ScheduleTrafficLights computes a schedule for traffic lights over h time units.
// The schedule is a 2D slice of dimensions (n x h), where schedule[i][t] denotes the state
// of the traffic light at intersection i at time t.
// This baseline solution implements a simple round-robin rotation between available states.
// It is intended as a starting point and does not guarantee optimal performance.

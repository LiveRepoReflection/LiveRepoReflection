## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory, distributed consensus log using the Raft consensus algorithm principles, focusing on the core log replication and consistency mechanisms.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Log Structure:** Implement a persistent, append-only log structure. Each log entry contains a unique integer `term` (representing the election term when the entry was created) and a `data` field (representing an arbitrary string). The log should support efficient appending of new entries and retrieval of entries by index.

2.  **Log Replication:** Implement a mechanism for replicating the log across multiple nodes (simulated within a single process using goroutines). You are *not* required to implement leader election or heartbeat mechanisms. Assume a single leader is pre-selected.

3.  **Consistency Check:** Implement a `ConsistencyCheck` function that, given a follower's log and the leader's log, determines the index of the last matching entry. This function is crucial for ensuring log consistency between the leader and followers. If the logs are completely divergent, the function should return -1.

4.  **Log Truncation:** Implement a `TruncateLog` function that, given a log and an index, removes all entries from that index onwards (inclusive). This function is required when a follower has conflicting entries and needs to align with the leader's log.

5.  **Concurrency Safety:** The log must be concurrency-safe.  Multiple goroutines (simulating different nodes) should be able to read and write to the log concurrently *without* data races. You must use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., mutexes, channels) to ensure data integrity.

6.  **Fault Tolerance (Simulated):** Implement a `SimulateFailure` function that randomly drops a certain percentage of append requests on a follower. This simulates network partitions or node failures.  The system should still maintain consistency, even with dropped requests, after the failure is "resolved" (i.e., the dropping stops). You **don't** need to implement actual recovery mechanisms (like timeouts or retries), just the simulation of drops.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **In-Memory:** The log must be stored in memory.  Persistence to disk is *not* required.
*   **Simplified Raft:** You do *not* need to implement the full Raft algorithm, including leader election, heartbeats, or timeouts. Focus solely on log replication, consistency checking, and truncation.
*   **Performance:** While absolute performance is not the primary focus, strive for reasonable efficiency. Avoid unnecessary copying of large data structures.  Consider the time complexity of appending, retrieving, and checking consistency.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.  Return appropriate errors for invalid operations (e.g., accessing an out-of-bounds index).
*   **Scalability:** While not directly tested, your design should consider the potential for scaling to a larger number of nodes and log entries.
*   **Testability:** The code should be designed to be easily testable. Use interfaces where appropriate to facilitate mocking and unit testing.

**Input:**

*   The `ConsistencyCheck` function takes two logs (leader's and follower's) as input.
*   The `TruncateLog` function takes a log and an index as input.
*   The `SimulateFailure` function takes a log, a drop percentage, and a stop channel as input.

**Output:**

*   The `ConsistencyCheck` function returns the index of the last matching entry in the follower's log.
*   The `TruncateLog` function modifies the log in place.
*   The `SimulateFailure` function modifies the log in place but doesn't return anything.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a system with one leader and two followers. The leader appends several entries to its log.  These entries are then replicated to the followers. `SimulateFailure` introduces intermittent packet loss on one of the followers. The `ConsistencyCheck` function is used to identify any discrepancies between the logs. The `TruncateLog` function is used to bring the followers' logs into agreement with the leader's log before resuming replication.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the code correctly implement the log replication, consistency check, and truncation logic?
*   **Concurrency Safety:** Is the code free from data races and concurrency-related bugs?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the code reasonably efficient, avoiding unnecessary overhead?
*   **Error Handling:** Does the code handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Testability:** Is the code designed to be easily tested?

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures, concurrency, and distributed systems principles. Good luck!

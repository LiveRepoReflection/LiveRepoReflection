Okay, I'm ready to design a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

**Project Name:** `DistributedRateLimiter`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter.  This rate limiter should be highly scalable and resilient.  It should protect a critical service from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.

**Functionality:**

The rate limiter must enforce rate limits based on a unique identifier (e.g., user ID, IP address, API key).  For a given identifier, it must allow a maximum number of requests (the "limit") within a specified time window (the "window").

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must operate across multiple nodes (simulated as goroutines or separate processes).  It should not rely on a single point of failure.

2.  **Configurable Limits:** The limit and window for each identifier should be configurable. A default limit and window should exist if no specific configuration is defined.

3.  **Atomic Operations:**  All operations related to tracking request counts must be atomic to prevent race conditions in the distributed environment.

4.  **Efficiency:**  The rate limiter must be highly efficient, minimizing latency and resource consumption. Aim for O(1) complexity where possible for `Allow()` operation.

5.  **Persistence (Optional):** The rate limiter should optionally support persistence of request counts and configurations to survive restarts.  Consider using a pluggable interface for different persistence backends (e.g., in-memory, Redis, database).

6.  **Time Synchronization:**  Assume the nodes have loosely synchronized clocks (NTP).  Small clock drifts are acceptable, but large discrepancies should be handled gracefully.

7.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests.

8.  **Scalability:**  The design should be scalable to handle a large number of identifiers and a high request rate.

9.  **Customizable Rejection Behavior:** The rate limiter needs to expose a way to customize the behavior when a request is rejected. It could be returning specific error codes or metrics.

**Interface:**

Implement a `RateLimiter` interface with at least the following methods:

```go
type RateLimiter interface {
	Allow(identifier string) (bool, time.Duration) // Returns true if the request is allowed, false otherwise. Also returns the time to wait until the next request is allowed, which is 0 if the request is allowed.

	ConfigureLimit(identifier string, limit int, window time.Duration) //Configures a specific limit and window for a given identifier.
	GetLimit(identifier string) (int, time.Duration) //Retrieves the limit and window for a given identifier. Returns the default limit and window if none is configured.
}
```

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be written in Go.
*   The solution must be well-documented and include clear explanations of the design choices.
*   The solution must include unit tests to verify its correctness.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   Demonstrate proper error handling.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement different rate limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window counter, sliding window log).
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the rate limiter's performance (e.g., requests per second, rejected requests, latency).
*   Implement dynamic limit adjustments based on system load or other metrics.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, data structures, and algorithms. It emphasizes practical considerations such as scalability, resilience, and performance. Good luck!

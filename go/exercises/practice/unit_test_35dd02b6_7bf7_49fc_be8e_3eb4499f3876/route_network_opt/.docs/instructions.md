## Question: Decentralized Route Optimization

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a route optimization system for a decentralized delivery network. The network consists of a set of autonomous delivery agents (drones, robots, etc.) that operate independently. Each agent has limited knowledge of the overall network and only knows about its immediate neighbors and the packages it's carrying.

The delivery network is represented as a weighted, directed graph, where nodes represent delivery locations (e.g., warehouses, customer addresses) and edges represent routes between locations. The weight of an edge represents the estimated travel time (or cost) between the two locations.

Each delivery agent starts at a specific location and needs to deliver a set of packages to their respective destination locations. Each package has a specific size and a destination node. A delivery agent can carry multiple packages at a time, but they have a limited carrying capacity.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Decentralization:** Agents must make routing decisions independently, based only on local information. No central server or coordinator is allowed. The system must handle the failure of individual agents gracefully without bringing down the entire network.

2.  **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the total delivery time for all agents. This includes travel time between locations and potential waiting times at delivery locations (e.g., due to congestion).

3.  **Carrying Capacity:** Each agent has a maximum carrying capacity (e.g., total weight, volume). Agents must not exceed this capacity.

4.  **Dynamic Network:** The network topology and edge weights can change over time (e.g., due to traffic, road closures, new delivery locations). Agents need to adapt to these changes dynamically.

5.  **Package Prioritization:** Some packages may have higher priority than others (e.g., express delivery). Agents should consider package priority when making routing decisions.

6.  **Collision Avoidance:** Agents should avoid routes that are likely to be congested or that could lead to collisions with other agents.

7.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of agents and delivery locations.

8.  **Real-time Decision Making:** Agents must make routing decisions in real-time, based on the current state of the network and their own load.

9.  **Resource Constraints:** Agents have limited computational resources and energy. The routing algorithm must be efficient and minimize resource consumption.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in a format suitable for representing the network graph, agent locations, package details, and network dynamics. The specific input format will be defined in the full problem specification, but it will include:

*   A description of the graph (nodes, edges, weights).
*   The initial location and carrying capacity of each agent.
*   A list of packages, including their size, destination, and priority.
*   A stream of updates to the network topology and edge weights.

**Output:**

The output should be a sequence of routing decisions made by each agent over time. Each decision should specify the next location that the agent will travel to and the packages that the agent will carry on that route.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the total delivery time for all packages, the efficiency of the routing algorithm, the scalability of the system, and its ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions.  Partial credit will be awarded for solutions that meet some, but not all, of the requirements. Bonus points will be awarded for innovative solutions that significantly improve the overall performance of the delivery network.

**Note:** This is a complex problem that requires a combination of algorithmic design, data structure implementation, and system design principles. There is no single "correct" solution, and different approaches may have different trade-offs. The goal is to design a system that is robust, efficient, and scalable.

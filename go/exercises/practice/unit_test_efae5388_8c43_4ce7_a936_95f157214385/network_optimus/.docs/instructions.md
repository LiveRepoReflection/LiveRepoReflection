### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimized communication network for a distributed system. The system consists of `n` nodes, each identified by a unique integer from `0` to `n-1`. Communication between nodes is subject to latency, which is represented as a weighted, undirected graph.

Your goal is to implement a function that determines the **minimum total cost** of a network configuration, such that a message originating from any node can reach any other node within a specified maximum latency.

**Specifically, you must design a function `OptimizeNetwork(n int, connections [][]int, maxLatency int) int` that takes the following inputs:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= n <= 1000).
*   `connections`: A list of undirected connections between nodes. Each connection is represented as a slice of three integers: `[node1, node2, latency]`, where `node1` and `node2` are the IDs of the connected nodes (0 <= node1, node2 < n), and `latency` is the latency of the connection (1 <= latency <= 1000). There may be multiple connections between the same pair of nodes, and self-loops are allowed.
*   `maxLatency`: The maximum allowable latency for a message to travel between any two nodes (1 <= maxLatency <= 100000).

**The function must return the minimum total cost of a subset of the given connections such that:**

*   **Connectivity:** For every pair of nodes (u, v), there exists at least one path connecting u and v.
*   **Latency Constraint:** For every pair of nodes (u, v), the shortest path between u and v in the *selected* subset of connections must have a total latency no greater than `maxLatency`.  The shortest path is defined as the path with the minimal sum of latencies of the connections it uses.
*   **Minimum Cost:** The total latency of the *selected* subset of connections is minimized.

If it's impossible to satisfy both the connectivity and latency constraints, the function should return `-1`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Graph Density:** The graph represented by `connections` can be dense, potentially with a large number of edges.
*   **Multiple Connections:** The connections input may contain multiple connections between the same two nodes with different latencies. You must consider *all* possible connections when finding the optimal subset.
*   **Negative Latency:** Connections will never have negative latencies.
*   **Efficiency:**  The solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit.  Consider algorithmic complexity carefully. You should aim for a solution with a time complexity better than O(n^4).  Solutions that only work for small test cases will not be accepted.
*   **Edge Cases:** Pay close attention to edge cases, such as:
    *   `n = 1`: A single node network.
    *   No connections are provided.
    *   The given connections are insufficient to create a fully connected graph.
    *   All possible paths between two nodes exceed `maxLatency`.

Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed with high difficulty, inspired by real-world scenarios and requiring efficient algorithms and data structures.

## Problem: Decentralized Content Distribution Network (dCDN)

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified content distribution network (CDN) in a decentralized environment.  Imagine a network of peer nodes, each capable of storing and serving content.  Due to network limitations and geographical distribution, accessing content from different nodes has varying costs (latency, bandwidth, etc.).  The goal is to efficiently retrieve a large file (represented as a sequence of chunks) from the network, minimizing the overall cost.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The CDN is represented as a weighted, undirected graph. Nodes in the graph represent peers in the network, and edges represent network connections between peers.  The weight of an edge represents the cost of transferring a single chunk of data between those two peers.  Assume the graph is connected.

2.  **File Representation:** The file to be retrieved is divided into `N` chunks, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.

3.  **Content Distribution:** Each peer node in the network stores a subset of the file chunks. A single chunk can be stored in multiple peers.

4.  **Retrieval Strategy:** Your task is to implement a function that determines the optimal (lowest cost) retrieval plan for all `N` chunks of the file, starting from a specified initiating node. The retrieval plan must specify which peer each chunk will be retrieved from.

5.  **Cost Calculation:** The total cost of the retrieval plan is calculated as the sum of two components:
    *   **Transfer Cost:** The cost of transferring each chunk from its source peer to the initiating node. This cost is calculated as the shortest path (sum of edge weights) from the source peer to the initiating node, multiplied by 1 (each chunk is assumed to be 1 unit of data). If the chunk is already present in the initiating node, the transfer cost is 0. If a path does not exist from the chunk source to the initiating node, you should consider this case and handle it accordingly.
    *   **Storage Cost:** Each peer has a storage cost associated with storing chunks. For the sake of simplicity, this cost is simply calculated as the square root of the number of chunks stored on that peer. It is only calculated once per peer, regardless of how many chunks are retrived from that peer.

**Input:**

*   `graph`:  A representation of the network graph. This can be a `map[string]map[string]int` where the outer key is the source peer, the inner key is the destination peer, and the int is the cost of transferring a chunk between these two peers.
*   `chunkLocations`: A `map[int][]string` representing the locations of each chunk. The key is the chunk index (0 to N-1), and the value is a slice of peer names where that chunk is stored.
*   `initiatingNode`: A `string` representing the name of the peer node where the file needs to be assembled.
*   `numChunks`: An `int` representing the total number of chunks in the file.

**Output:**

*   A `float64` representing the minimum total cost to retrieve all `N` chunks.
*   You must ensure that your function is reasonably performant.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The graph can be large (hundreds or thousands of nodes).
*   The number of chunks `N` can be large (thousands).
*   A chunk might not be available on *any* node.  In this case, the program should return `-1`.
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Edge weights are positive integers.
*   Multiple nodes can store the same chunk.
*   The initiating node might already have some or all of the chunks.
*   Ensure you handle cases where the initiating node or other specified peer is not present in the graph.
*   Consider potential integer overflow issues when calculating sums.
*   Aim for an efficient solution. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be optimized for both time and memory complexity. Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., heaps for shortest path algorithms).
*   The shortest path algorithm should be efficient (e.g., Dijkstra's or A\*).
*   Caching intermediate results (e.g., shortest paths between nodes) can significantly improve performance.

**Example:**

(Illustrative, full test cases will be more complex)

```go
graph := map[string]map[string]int{
    "A": {"B": 1, "C": 5},
    "B": {"A": 1, "D": 3},
    "C": {"A": 5, "D": 2},
    "D": {"B": 3, "C": 2},
}

chunkLocations := map[int][]string{
    0: {"A", "B"},
    1: {"C", "D"},
}

initiatingNode := "A"
numChunks := 2

cost := CalculateMinimumCost(graph, chunkLocations, initiatingNode, numChunks)

// Expected output would be a float64 representing the minimum cost of retriving chunks 0 and 1 at node A
```

This problem combines graph algorithms (shortest path), data structure optimization (choosing appropriate structures for efficiency), and real-world considerations (handling unavailable data, minimizing costs).  It requires a good understanding of algorithmic complexity and careful implementation to pass all test cases within reasonable time limits. Good luck!

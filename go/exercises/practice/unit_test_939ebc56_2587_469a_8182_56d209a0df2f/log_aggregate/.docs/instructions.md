Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at the LeetCode hard level, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and practical application.

### Project Name

`ScalableLogAggregation`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable log aggregation system. Your system will receive a continuous stream of log entries from a distributed set of applications. Each log entry consists of the following:

*   **Timestamp:** An integer representing the Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) when the log entry was generated.
*   **Application ID:** A string identifying the application that generated the log entry.
*   **Log Level:** An integer representing the severity of the log entry (e.g., 1 for DEBUG, 2 for INFO, 3 for WARNING, 4 for ERROR, 5 for FATAL).
*   **Message:** A string containing the log message.

Your system needs to support the following operations efficiently:

1.  **Ingest Log Entry:** Add a new log entry to the system.
2.  **Query Logs:** Retrieve all log entries within a specified timestamp range, filtered by one or more application IDs and optionally filtered by a minimum log level. The results should be sorted by timestamp in ascending order.

**Constraints:**

*   The system must handle a high volume of incoming log entries (millions per second).
*   Query latency must be minimized, even with large datasets.
*   Memory usage should be optimized to avoid excessive resource consumption.
*   The solution should be concurrent-safe. Multiple goroutines might be ingesting logs and querying logs simultaneously.
*   Assume that timestamps are monotonically increasing for each application. This means that within a specific application, log entries will always arrive in chronological order. However, logs from different applications can arrive in any order.
*   The timestamp range for queries can be very large.
*   The number of unique application IDs can be substantial (thousands or tens of thousands).

**Input:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on its ability to handle a large number of ingest and query operations, with varying timestamp ranges, application ID filters, and log level filters.

Ingest Log Entry:
```go
type LogEntry struct {
    Timestamp     int64
    ApplicationID string
    LogLevel      int
    Message       string
}
```

Query Logs:
```go
// QueryLogs retrieves log entries within the specified time range,
// filtered by application IDs and a minimum log level.
//
// Parameters:
//   startTime: The start timestamp (inclusive).
//   endTime:   The end timestamp (inclusive).
//   appIDs:    A slice of application IDs to filter by.  If empty, no filtering is applied.
//   minLogLevel: The minimum log level to filter by. If 0, no filtering is applied.
//
// Returns:
//   A slice of LogEntry objects that match the query criteria, sorted by timestamp.
//   An error, if any occurred.
func (s *LogSystem) QueryLogs(startTime, endTime int64, appIDs []string, minLogLevel int) ([]LogEntry, error) {
  // Implementation Needed
}
```

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Consider using appropriate data structures to optimize both ingest and query performance.  Think about the trade-offs between different data structures (e.g., trees, maps, sorted arrays).
*   Employ concurrency patterns to handle the high volume of incoming log entries and concurrent queries.
*   Optimize memory usage to prevent out-of-memory errors, especially when dealing with large datasets.  Consider techniques like data compression or indexing.
*   You may need to employ multiple data structures to optimize for ingest and query separately.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty application ID list in queries.
*   Overlapping timestamp ranges in queries.
*   Queries with very large timestamp ranges.
*   Invalid log levels.
*   No log entries matching the query criteria.
*   Simultaneous read and write operations on shared data structures.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and optimization techniques.  The goal is to create a robust and scalable log aggregation system that can handle a high volume of data and complex query patterns. Good luck!

**Problem Title:** Efficient Range Minimum Queries with Dynamic Updates and Constraints

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a highly efficient data structure and algorithm to handle a large number of range minimum queries (RMQ) and dynamic updates on an array of integers, subject to specific memory constraints and concurrency considerations.

You are given an array `A` of `N` integers. The array is initially populated with random integers. Your system should be able to handle two types of operations:

1.  **Query(L, R):** Find the minimum value within the subarray `A[L...R]` (inclusive). Indexes are 0-based.
2.  **Update(Index, Value):** Update the element at `A[Index]` to `Value`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Array Size:** `N` can be very large (up to 10<sup>7</sup>).
*   **Query Volume:** The system should handle a very high volume of queries and updates (up to 10<sup>8</sup> total operations).
*   **Range Size:**  The range `R - L` in queries can vary significantly (from 1 to N).
*   **Memory Limit:** The memory usage of your data structure is strictly limited (e.g., no more than 8MB).  This constraint necessitates a space-efficient approach.
*   **Concurrency:** The system must be thread-safe.  Multiple goroutines can concurrently issue `Query` and `Update` operations.  Implement proper synchronization to avoid race conditions.
*   **Time Complexity:** Aim for a time complexity significantly better than O(N) for queries, even with updates interspersed.  Solutions with O(N) query time will likely time out.
*   **Update Frequency:** Updates may be frequent, so the update operation must also be efficient.
*   **Integer Range:** Values in the array, and the values used for updates, will be within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
*   **Error Handling:**  The system must handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., `L > R`, `Index` out of bounds). Return an appropriate error value (e.g., `math.MaxInt32` for queries with invalid ranges, and an error for invalid updates).
*   **No External Libraries:**  You are restricted to using only the standard Go library.  No external dependencies are allowed.

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided via a channel of operations. Each operation is represented as a string.

*   `"Q L R"` represents a Query operation where `L` and `R` are integers representing the left and right indices.
*   `"U Index Value"` represents an Update operation where `Index` is the index to update and `Value` is the new value.

**Output Format:**

The `Query` function should return the minimum value in the specified range. The `Update` function should return an error value, if any.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:**  The ability to accurately compute the minimum value for all valid queries after any sequence of updates.
*   **Performance:**  The ability to handle a large volume of queries and updates within a reasonable time limit.  Solutions with poor time complexity will be penalized.
*   **Memory Usage:**  The solution's memory footprint must stay within the specified limit.  Solutions that exceed the limit will be rejected.
*   **Concurrency Safety:**  The solution must be thread-safe and avoid race conditions.
*   **Code Quality:** Clean, well-documented, and idiomatic Go code is expected.

**Example:**

Input Channel:

```
"Q 0 4"
"U 2 10"
"Q 0 4"
"U 1 1"
"Q 0 2"
```

If the initial array A was: `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`

Then the `Query` operations would return:

*   First "Q 0 4": `1`
*   Second "Q 0 4": `5` (after updating A[2] to 10: `[5, 2, 10, 1, 9]`)
*   Third "Q 0 2": `2` (after updating A[1] to 1: `[5, 1, 10, 1, 9]`)

This problem demands a careful balance of algorithmic efficiency, memory management, and concurrency control, making it a challenging task for experienced Go programmers. Good luck!

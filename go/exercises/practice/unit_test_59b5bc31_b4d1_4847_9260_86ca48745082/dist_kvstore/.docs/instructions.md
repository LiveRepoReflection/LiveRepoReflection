## Problem: Distributed Key-Value Store with Consistent Hashing and Replication

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed key-value store. This system will leverage consistent hashing to distribute data across multiple nodes and implement replication for fault tolerance and improved read performance.

**Functionality:**

Implement the following functionalities:

1.  **`AddNode(nodeID string)`:** Adds a new node to the cluster. The `nodeID` is a unique identifier for the node (e.g., "node1", "node2").  Nodes can join the cluster at any time. Assume nodeID is a UUID.

2.  **`RemoveNode(nodeID string)`:** Removes a node from the cluster.  Data replication needs to be handled properly during removal to maintain data integrity. Nodes can leave the cluster at any time.

3.  **`Put(key string, value string)`:** Stores a key-value pair in the cluster. The key should be hashed using consistent hashing to determine the primary node responsible for storing the data. Data should be replicated to `N` (replication factor) nodes following the primary node in the consistent hash ring.

4.  **`Get(key string)`:** Retrieves the value associated with a given key. The request should be routed to the primary node (determined by consistent hashing). If the primary node is unavailable, the system should attempt to retrieve the value from a replica node. Implement a read repair mechanism: if a replica has an outdated value, update it with the correct value from the primary or another up-to-date replica.

5.  **`ListNodes()`:** Returns a sorted slice of nodeIDs currently in the cluster (sorted by nodeID string).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Consistent Hashing:** Use consistent hashing to distribute keys across nodes.  You can use any suitable hashing algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA-256, or a simpler algorithm for simulation purposes).  The ring should have a large enough number of virtual nodes (at least 100 per physical node) to ensure relatively even distribution.

*   **Replication:** Implement data replication. The replication factor `N` will be provided during initialization.  Data must be replicated to `N` nodes, including the primary.

*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to tolerate node failures. If a node is unavailable, the system should automatically route requests to replica nodes.

*   **Data Consistency:** Ensure eventual consistency. While immediate consistency is not required, strive to minimize the time it takes for updates to propagate to all replicas. Implement read repair.

*   **Concurrency:** The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent `Put`, `Get`, `AddNode`, and `RemoveNode` operations correctly. Use appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`).

*   **Optimization:**
    *   Optimize for read performance.
    *   Minimize data transfer during node addition and removal by only moving the necessary data.
    *   Avoid unnecessary locking.

*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling. Return appropriate errors when:
    *   Trying to `Get` a key that doesn't exist.
    *   Trying to `RemoveNode` or `AddNode` with a nodeID that already exists, or does not exist.
    *   Any other unexpected errors occur.

*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement actual network communication, design your system with scalability in mind.  Consider how the system would handle a large number of nodes and a high volume of requests.

*   **`N` Value:** The replication factor `N` will be a positive integer.  Your code should gracefully handle `N=1` (no replication).  `N` will always be less than or equal to the number of nodes in the cluster.

*   **Data Persistence:** In this simplified version, you do *not* need to implement persistent storage. Data can be stored in memory (e.g., using a `map`).

**Input:**

The input will consist of a series of function calls to the `AddNode`, `RemoveNode`, `Put`, `Get`, and `ListNodes` methods.

**Output:**

*   `Put`: No return value.  Errors should be returned as needed.
*   `Get`: Returns the value associated with the key or an error if the key doesn't exist or if the system is unable to retrieve the value.
*   `ListNodes`: Returns a sorted slice of nodeIDs.
*   `AddNode`, `RemoveNode`: No return value. Errors should be returned as needed.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The system must correctly store and retrieve data, handle node failures, and maintain data consistency.
*   Concurrency: The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent operations correctly.
*   Performance: The system should be optimized for read performance and minimize data transfer during node addition and removal.
*   Scalability: The design should be scalable to a large number of nodes and a high volume of requests.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.  Use appropriate data structures and algorithms.
*   Error Handling: The system should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. Good luck!

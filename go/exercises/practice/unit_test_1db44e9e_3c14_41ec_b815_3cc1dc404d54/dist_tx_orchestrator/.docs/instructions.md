## Question: Distributed Transaction Orchestration

**Problem Statement:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction orchestration system in Go. This system is responsible for managing transactions that span multiple independent services (databases, message queues, external APIs, etc.). The goal is to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties across these services, even in the face of failures.

**Scenario:**

Imagine an e-commerce platform where placing an order involves multiple steps across different services:

1.  **Inventory Service:** Checks if the requested items are in stock and reserves them.
2.  **Payment Service:** Processes the payment from the customer.
3.  **Shipping Service:** Creates a shipping order.
4.  **Notification Service:** Sends confirmation emails and SMS to the customer.

Each of these services has its own independent database and API. If any step fails, the entire order placement process must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Orchestration:** Implement a central orchestrator service that manages the transaction flow across the participating services. This orchestrator should define the sequence of operations and handle potential failures.
2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol (Modified):** Implement a modified version of the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. The orchestrator should coordinate the "prepare" and "commit/rollback" phases. Due to the limitations of real distributed database implementations, the standard 2PC might not directly apply. You need to simulate its effects through compensating transactions.
3.  **Compensating Transactions:** For each operation on a service, define a corresponding compensating transaction that undoes the changes made by the original operation. For example:
    *   For "reserve items," the compensating transaction is "release items."
    *   For "process payment," the compensating transaction is "refund payment."
    *   For "create shipping order," the compensating transaction is "cancel shipping order."
4.  **Idempotency:** Ensure that all operations and compensating transactions are idempotent. This means that executing the same operation multiple times has the same effect as executing it once. This is crucial for handling retries in a distributed environment.
5.  **Failure Handling:** Implement robust failure handling mechanisms. The orchestrator should be able to handle service failures, network partitions, and its own failures. Consider using timeouts and retries with exponential backoff. If a service fails during the "prepare" phase, the orchestrator should initiate a rollback of all previously completed operations. If a service fails during the "commit" phase, the orchestrator should retry the commit operation until it succeeds.
6.  **Concurrency:** Design the orchestrator to handle multiple concurrent order placement requests efficiently. Consider using goroutines and channels for concurrency management.
7.  **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities to track the progress of transactions and identify potential issues.  Logs should include transaction IDs, timestamps, service names, and status updates.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Simulated Services:** You don't need to interact with real external services. Instead, simulate these services using in-memory data structures or mock implementations. Each service simulation should have methods to represent the primary transaction and the compensating transaction. Simulate potential failures (e.g., by randomly returning errors or by introducing delays).
2.  **Transaction ID:** Generate a unique transaction ID for each order placement request. This ID should be used to track the transaction across all services.
3.  **Timeout:** Implement a global timeout for each transaction. If the transaction does not complete within the timeout period, it should be rolled back.
4.  **Error Handling:** Return meaningful error codes and messages to the caller, indicating the reason for transaction failure.

**Optimization Requirements:**

1.  **Minimizing Latency:**  Design the system to minimize the overall latency of the transaction. Explore strategies such as parallel execution of independent operations and efficient retry mechanisms.
2.  **Resource Utilization:** Optimize resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) by efficiently managing concurrent transactions and minimizing unnecessary retries.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  **Correctness:** The system correctly implements the distributed transaction orchestration logic, ensuring ACID properties.
2.  **Robustness:** The system is robust and can handle various failure scenarios gracefully.
3.  **Performance:** The system exhibits good performance in terms of latency and throughput.
4.  **Code Quality:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
5.  **Testability:** The code is designed to be easily testable, with well-defined interfaces and dependencies.
6.  **Scalability:** While not directly tested, the design should consider potential scalability challenges and propose solutions.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, error handling, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

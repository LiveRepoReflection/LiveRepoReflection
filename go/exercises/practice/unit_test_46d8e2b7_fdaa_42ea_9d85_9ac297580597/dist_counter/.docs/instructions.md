Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Go coding problem. Here's the problem statement:

### Project Name

`DistributedConsistentCounter`

### Question Description

Design and implement a highly available, distributed, eventually consistent counter service.

The service should maintain a single, monotonically increasing integer value across a cluster of `N` nodes. Each node should be able to independently increment the counter and, after some time, all nodes should converge to the same, highest observed value.

Specifically, you need to implement the following:

1.  **`Increment()`**: A method that atomically increments the counter on a given node. The method should return the updated value of the counter *on that node immediately*. There is no requirement for global consistency at the point of the increment.

2.  **`Get()`**: A method that returns the current value of the counter on a given node.

3.  **`Sync()`**: A method that allows nodes to synchronize their counter values. This method is called periodically by each node and is the mechanism by which the counter achieves eventual consistency. The method should take a list of counter values from other nodes in the cluster and update the local counter value if a higher value is observed.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **High Availability:** The service should remain operational even if some nodes are temporarily unavailable.
*   **Eventual Consistency:** All nodes should eventually converge to the same, correct, and highest observed counter value, assuming no further increments occur.
*   **Monotonic Increase:** The counter value *must* never decrease on any node.
*   **Concurrency:** The counter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent `Increment()` and `Sync()` calls.
*   **Scalability:** The design should be scalable to a large number of nodes. Consider how the number of nodes impacts `Sync()` call.
*   **Network Communication:** Assume a reliable but potentially asynchronous network between nodes. You *do not* need to implement actual networking code. Instead, you will simulate synchronization by passing the counter values directly between nodes in the testing environment.
*   **Optimizations:** Your solution should be reasonably efficient in terms of CPU and memory usage, especially during `Sync()`. Avoid unnecessary data copying or complex locking strategies.
*   **Data Structure Choice:** Carefully consider the data structures you use to store the counter value and any metadata related to synchronization.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling, but focus primarily on correctness and consistency.
*   **No External Dependencies:** You should not use any external libraries or packages for distributed consensus (e.g., Raft, Paxos, etcd). The goal is to implement a simple, eventually consistent counter from scratch.

**Specific Implementation Details:**

*   Implement the counter service as a `struct` in Go.
*   The `Sync()` method should be designed to minimize the amount of data exchanged between nodes. A naive approach will be extremely inefficient.
*   Consider using techniques such as vector clocks or similar mechanisms to efficiently track and reconcile counter values across nodes. You don't need to implement full vector clocks, but you should strive for a similar level of efficiency.
*   The provided test cases will simulate a distributed environment by creating multiple counter instances and calling their `Increment()` and `Sync()` methods in various sequences.

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, distributed systems concepts, and algorithmic optimization. The best solutions will balance correctness, efficiency, and scalability. Good luck!

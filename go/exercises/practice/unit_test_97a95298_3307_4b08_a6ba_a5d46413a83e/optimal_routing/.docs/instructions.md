`OptimalNetworkRouting`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, each uniquely identified by an integer from `0` to `N-1`. The network's topology is dynamic, meaning connections between nodes can change frequently.

The current state of the network is represented by two data structures:

1.  **Adjacency List:** `adj[i]` contains a list of node IDs that node `i` is directly connected to. This represents the current, instantaneous connectivity of the network. The connections are undirected.
2.  **Link Costs:** `costs[i][j]` represents the cost of sending data directly between node `i` and node `j`. If `i` and `j` are not directly connected (i.e., `j` is not in `adj[i]`), `costs[i][j]` is considered to be infinity (represented as a very large integer). The cost can vary dynamically based on network conditions.

Your goal is to implement a function `findOptimalRoute(startNode, endNode, adj, costs)` that calculates the lowest latency path (minimum total cost) from a `startNode` to an `endNode` within a given time constraint, `max_time`.  The algorithm must handle network topology and link cost updates efficiently and adaptively.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Large Scale:** The network can have up to `10^5` nodes (`N <= 100000`).
*   **Dynamic Topology:** The adjacency list `adj` and link costs `costs` can change at any time between calls to `findOptimalRoute`. You need to design your algorithm to minimize the computation needed to re-calculate paths after updates.
*   **Time Constraint:** Each `findOptimalRoute` call has a strict time limit. Your solution must be optimized to find a reasonably good route within `max_time` milliseconds, even if it's not guaranteed to be the absolute shortest path in all cases. A reasonable time is defined by the test cases.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no path exists between `startNode` and `endNode` within the time limit, in which case, return -1. Also handle the case where `startNode == endNode`, return 0.
*   **Cost Metric:** Minimize the sum of link costs along the path. Link costs are non-negative integers.
*   **Memory Limit:** Pay attention to memory usage, especially given the large scale of the network.  Avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
*   **Optimization:** You are expected to use appropriate algorithmic optimizations to meet the performance requirements.  Consider using heuristics, approximations, or pre-computation techniques (with careful consideration of the dynamic topology) to balance accuracy and speed. Caching is allowed, but must be carefully invalidated when `adj` or `costs` change.
*   **max_time**: Represents the maximum execution time in milliseconds your `findOptimalRoute` function can take. It should be less than 500ms.
*   It is guaranteed that nodes in adj[i] are in range `[0, N-1]`
*   `0 <= startNode, endNode < N`

**Input:**

*   `startNode` (int): The starting node ID.
*   `endNode` (int): The destination node ID.
*   `adj` (list of lists of int): The adjacency list representing the network topology. `adj[i]` is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to node `i`.
*   `costs` (list of lists of int): A 2D list representing the cost matrix. `costs[i][j]` is the cost of going from node `i` to node `j`. If there is no direct link it will be a sufficiently large integer.
*   `max_time` (int): the maximum execution time for the `findOptimalRoute` function in milliseconds.

**Output:**

*   (int): The minimum total cost of the path from `startNode` to `endNode`, or -1 if no path exists within the time limit.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
adj = [
    [1, 2],
    [0, 3],
    [0, 4],
    [1],
    [2]
]
costs = [
    [0, 2, 3, 1000, 1000],
    [2, 0, 1000, 4, 1000],
    [3, 1000, 0, 1000, 5],
    [1000, 4, 1000, 0, 1000],
    [1000, 1000, 5, 1000, 0]
]
startNode = 0
endNode = 3
max_time = 100

findOptimalRoute(startNode, endNode, adj, costs, max_time) == 6  (Path: 0 -> 1 -> 3)

startNode = 0
endNode = 4
max_time = 100

findOptimalRoute(startNode, endNode, adj, costs, max_time) == 8  (Path: 0 -> 2 -> 4)

```

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem, designed to be LeetCode Hard level, focusing on graph traversal, optimization, and real-world application.

### Project Name

`OptimalPathPlanning`

### Question Description

You are tasked with developing an optimal path planning algorithm for a delivery drone operating in a densely populated urban environment. The city is represented as a weighted directed graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent intersections or delivery locations. Each node has a location (x, y) coordinate and a risk factor (non-negative integer) associated with it. The risk factor represents the likelihood of encountering obstacles or disruptions at that location.
*   **Edges:** Represent possible flight paths between locations. Each edge has a weight representing the flight time (positive floating-point number) and a maximum altitude constraint (positive floating-point number).  The drone *must* fly at or below this altitude.

Your goal is to find the fastest (minimum flight time) path for the drone to deliver a package from a designated start node to a designated end node, subject to several constraints:

1.  **Altitude Constraint:** The drone must respect the maximum altitude constraint on each edge it traverses.

2.  **Risk Tolerance:** The drone has a maximum acceptable *total risk* for the entire path. The total risk of a path is the sum of the risk factors of all the nodes visited *including* the start and end nodes. If no path exists within the risk tolerance, return an error.

3.  **No Fly Zones:** Certain circular areas within the city are designated as "no-fly zones." These are defined by a center (x, y) coordinate and a radius. The drone's path (edges) *cannot* intersect these no-fly zones. Consider an edge intersecting a no-fly zone if any point on the line segment representing the edge is within the radius of the no-fly zone's center.

4.  **Battery Life:** The drone has a limited battery life. The total flight time of the optimal path cannot exceed a given maximum flight time. If no path exists that meets the battery life constraint, return an error.

5.  **Optimization:** Given multiple paths that meet all the constraints, your algorithm should return the path with the *absolute* minimum flight time.  Efficiency is paramount; your solution must be able to handle graphs with thousands of nodes and edges within reasonable time limits.

6.  **Floating-Point Precision:** Be mindful of potential floating-point precision issues when comparing flight times and calculating distances.  Choose an appropriate tolerance for comparisons.

**Input:**

*   A graph representation (you can define the struct/data structure as you see fit, but it must be well-documented).
*   A start node ID.
*   An end node ID.
*   A maximum total risk (integer).
*   A maximum flight time (floating-point number).
*   A list of "no-fly zones" (each defined by a center (x, y) and radius).

**Output:**

*   A list of node IDs representing the optimal path from the start node to the end node.
*   An error if no path exists that satisfies *all* the constraints.

**Considerations:**

*   Think carefully about your data structures for representing the graph and no-fly zones.
*   Consider using an efficient graph traversal algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*) with modifications to handle the constraints.
*   Think about how to efficiently check for edge intersections with no-fly zones.
*   Address potential performance bottlenecks.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, geometric calculations, and careful optimization. It will test the solver's ability to design an efficient and robust solution in a real-world context. Good luck!

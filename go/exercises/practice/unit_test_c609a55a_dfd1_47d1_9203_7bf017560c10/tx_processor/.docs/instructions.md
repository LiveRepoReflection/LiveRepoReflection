Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and require careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and edge cases in Go:

### Project Name

`ConcurrentTransactionProcessor`

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a concurrent transaction processing system.  This system will receive a stream of transactions, validate them against a set of account balances, and apply them if valid.  Due to the high volume of transactions, the system must be highly concurrent and efficient.

**Details:**

1.  **Transaction Structure:**
    ```go
    type Transaction struct {
        AccountID   string
        Amount      int64 // Can be positive (deposit) or negative (withdrawal)
        TransactionID string // Unique identifier for each transaction
    }
    ```

2.  **Account Balances:** Account balances are stored in memory. You should manage these balances safely to prevent race conditions. You can assume that all `AccountID`s are valid and present initially.

3.  **Transaction Validation:** A transaction is valid if the following conditions are met:
    *   The `AccountID` exists.
    *   For withdrawals (`Amount < 0`), the absolute value of the `Amount` must be less than or equal to the current balance of the `AccountID`.
    *   Each `TransactionID` should only be processed once. Duplicate `TransactionID`s should be rejected.

4.  **Concurrency:** The system must handle a large number of concurrent transactions efficiently. Use Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, mutexes, atomic operations, etc.) to achieve this.

5.  **Transaction Ordering:**  Transactions for the **same** `AccountID` must be processed in the order they are received. Transactions for *different* `AccountID`s can be processed concurrently.

6.  **Error Handling:** The system must handle errors gracefully. Define an `Error` type that encapsulates the reason for a transaction's failure.  Provide mechanisms to track and report errors.

7.  **API:** Implement the following functions:
    *   `NewTransactionProcessor(initialBalances map[string]int64) *TransactionProcessor`: Constructor to initialize the transaction processor with initial account balances.

    *   `SubmitTransaction(tx Transaction) error`: Submits a transaction to the processing system.  Returns an `Error` if the transaction is invalid or cannot be processed.

    *   `GetBalance(accountID string) (int64, error)`: Returns the current balance for the specified `accountID`. Returns an error if the `accountID` does not exist.

    *   `GetErrorCount() int`: Returns the total number of transaction processing errors encountered.

8. **Optimizations**: Optimize for high throughput. Minimize lock contention and unnecessary memory allocations.

9. **Constraints:**
    *   The number of accounts can be large (e.g., millions).
    *   The transaction rate can be very high (e.g., thousands per second).
    *   Memory usage should be kept as low as possible.

10. **Edge Cases**:
    *   Handle concurrent reads and writes to the same account balance.
    *   Handle cases where transactions arrive out of order (though they should be processed in order *per account*).
    *   Handle cases with a large number of concurrent goroutines.
    *   Implement proper shutdown/cleanup mechanisms to prevent resource leaks.

**Example Usage:**

```go
balances := map[string]int64{"A": 100, "B": 50}
processor := NewTransactionProcessor(balances)

err := processor.SubmitTransaction(Transaction{AccountID: "A", Amount: -20, TransactionID: "tx1"})
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Transaction failed:", err)
}

balanceA, _ := processor.GetBalance("A")
fmt.Println("Balance of A:", balanceA) // Should be 80

err = processor.SubmitTransaction(Transaction{AccountID: "A", Amount: -100, TransactionID: "tx2"}) // insufficient balance
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Transaction failed:", err)
}

balanceA, _ = processor.GetBalance("A")
fmt.Println("Balance of A:", balanceA) // should still be 80

err = processor.SubmitTransaction(Transaction{AccountID: "A", Amount: 10, TransactionID: "tx1"}) // duplicate TransactionID
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Transaction failed:", err)
}
```

**Bonus (For extreme difficulty):**

*   Implement a mechanism to persist transaction logs to disk asynchronously for auditing and recovery purposes.
*   Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent the system from being overwhelmed by invalid transactions.
*   Add metrics collection and reporting (e.g., using Prometheus) to monitor system performance.
This problem challenges the solver to design a robust and efficient concurrent system, requiring a good understanding of Go's concurrency primitives, data structures, and error handling. The optimization requirements and edge cases make it a difficult and sophisticated problem. Good luck!

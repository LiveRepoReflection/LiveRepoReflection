Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a range of skills, including data structures, algorithms, optimization, and real-world considerations.

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkPlacement`

## Question Description

**Scenario:**

You are tasked with optimizing the placement of Content Delivery Network (CDN) servers in a network to minimize latency for users accessing content. The network is represented as a weighted undirected graph, where nodes represent cities and edges represent network connections with associated latency costs (weights).

**Problem Statement:**

Given:

*   A weighted undirected graph representing the network, with `N` cities (nodes) and `M` connections (edges). Each edge has a latency cost associated with it.
*   A list of `K` user locations (cities) with their respective content request rates (requests per second).
*   A maximum number `P` of CDN servers that can be deployed.
*   A CDN server placement cost `C` per server.
*   A latency threshold `T`. Requests exceeding this threshold are considered unacceptable.

You need to determine the optimal placement of `P` CDN servers within the network to minimize the *total cost*.

*   The total cost is calculated as the sum of server placement costs and latency costs.
*   For each user, their requests are routed to the nearest CDN server (in terms of latency).
*   If a user's nearest CDN server results in a latency exceeding the threshold `T`, then that user's requests are routed to the *origin server* (city 0, always exists and never considered as user location). The latency from any user to the origin server is pre-calculated and given as input.
*   The latency cost is the sum of the latency for all requests, calculated as request rate multiplied by latency.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of cities)
*   `1 <= M <= 5000` (Number of connections)
*   `1 <= K <= 100` (Number of user locations)
*   `1 <= P <= 20` (Maximum number of CDN servers)
*   `1 <= latency <= 100` (Latency cost for each connection)
*   `1 <= request_rate <= 1000` (Content request rate for each user)
*   `1 <= C <= 1000` (CDN server placement cost)
*   `1 <= T <= 1000` (Latency threshold)
*   City IDs are integers from 0 to N-1. City 0 is always the origin server.

**Input Format:**

The input is provided as follows:

1.  `N M K P C T` (Number of cities, connections, users, maximum servers, server placement cost, latency threshold)
2.  `M` lines: `city1 city2 latency` (representing a connection between `city1` and `city2` with the given latency)
3.  `K` lines: `user_city request_rate` (representing a user at `user_city` with the given request rate)
4.  `N` lines: `origin_latency` (the latency from each city to the origin server, city 0).  The latency to the origin from city `i` is on line `i`).

**Output Format:**

A single integer representing the minimum total cost (server placement cost + latency cost) achieved by the optimal CDN server placement.

**Example:**

(Illustrative - Specific numbers might not lead to optimal solutions easily verifiable by hand, but the format is correct)

```
5 6 2 1 100 20
0 1 5
0 2 10
1 2 3
1 3 8
2 4 7
3 4 2
1 50
4 30
12
0
15
18
9
```

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be computationally efficient to handle the given constraints.  Brute-force approaches are unlikely to pass all test cases. Consider using dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or other optimization techniques.
*   Memory usage should also be considered.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Multiple connections might exist between two cities (handle appropriately).
*   The optimal solution might involve placing fewer than `P` servers.
*   A user and a city might be the same.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged on correctness (passing all test cases) and efficiency (time and memory usage). Solutions exceeding time or memory limits will be penalized.

Good luck!

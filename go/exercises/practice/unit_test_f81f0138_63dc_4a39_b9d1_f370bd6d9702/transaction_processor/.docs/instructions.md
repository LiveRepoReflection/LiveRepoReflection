Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a variety of skills.

## Project Name

`Concurrent Transaction Processor`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building a concurrent transaction processor for a simplified banking system. The system needs to handle a high volume of transactions while ensuring data consistency and integrity.  Each transaction represents a transfer of funds between two bank accounts.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Account Representation:** Represent bank accounts using a suitable data structure. Each account has a unique account ID (an integer) and a balance (an integer).

2.  **Transaction Structure:** Define a transaction structure. Each transaction should include:
    *   A unique transaction ID (an integer).
    *   The source account ID.
    *   The destination account ID.
    *   The amount to transfer.

3.  **Concurrent Processing:** Implement a system that can process multiple transactions concurrently.  Use goroutines and channels to achieve concurrency.

4.  **Transaction Validation:** Before processing a transaction, the system must validate the transaction. Validation rules:
    *   The source and destination account IDs must exist.
    *   The source account must have sufficient funds to cover the transfer.
    *   The transfer amount must be positive.
    *   A transaction ID must be unique.

5.  **Atomicity and Consistency:** Ensure that each transaction is processed atomically.  Either the entire transfer happens, or none of it does. The system must maintain data consistency, meaning the total balance across all accounts remains constant.

6.  **Deadlock Prevention:** Implement a mechanism to prevent deadlocks.  Transactions should not block each other indefinitely.

7.  **Error Handling:**  Provide robust error handling. The system should be able to gracefully handle invalid transactions, account lookup failures, and other potential errors.  Return meaningful error messages.

8.  **Transaction Logging:** Maintain a log of all processed transactions, indicating whether they were successful or failed, along with the reason for failure (if applicable). This log should be accessible.

9.  **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) or Pessimistic Locking:** You can choose either optimistic concurrency control using compare-and-swap operations (CAS) or pessimistic locking using mutexes to manage concurrency. Justify your design choice.

10. **Scalability:** Your solution should be designed with scalability in mind. Consider how your design would handle a significantly larger number of accounts and transactions.

**Input:**

The system receives a stream of transactions as input. These transactions can arrive in any order and at any time. You'll need to simulate this input stream in your testing.

**Output:**

The system should provide the following output:

*   A mechanism to query the balance of a specific account.
*   A mechanism to retrieve the transaction log.

**Constraints:**

*   Number of accounts: Up to 100,000.
*   Account IDs: Integers from 1 to 100,000 (inclusive).
*   Initial account balance: Can be any non-negative integer.
*   Transaction amount: Positive integer.
*   Number of concurrent transactions: Up to 1,000.
*   Time limit: The system should be able to process a large number of transactions within a reasonable time (e.g., a few seconds).
*   Memory limit: Reasonable memory usage. Avoid excessive memory allocation.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the system correctly process transactions and maintain data consistency?
*   Concurrency: Does the system effectively utilize concurrency to improve performance?
*   Deadlock Prevention: Does the system prevent deadlocks?
*   Error Handling: Does the system handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages?
*   Scalability: Is the system designed with scalability in mind?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Efficiency: Minimize execution time and memory usage.

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, data structures, algorithms, and error handling in Go.  It also necessitates careful design considerations to ensure correctness, performance, and scalability. Good luck!

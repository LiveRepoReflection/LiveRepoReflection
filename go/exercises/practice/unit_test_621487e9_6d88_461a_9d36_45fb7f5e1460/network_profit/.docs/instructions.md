Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Go coding problem:

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkDeployment`

## Question Description

A telecommunications company, "GoTel," is planning to deploy a fiber optic network to connect `N` cities. Each city is represented by a unique integer from `0` to `N-1`.  The company has conducted extensive surveys and determined the potential profit from connecting any two cities directly with a fiber optic cable.  These profits can vary significantly based on factors like population density, business activity, and existing infrastructure.  Connecting two cities that are far apart is more costly.

You are given the following information:

*   `N`: The number of cities (an integer).
*   `profits`: A 2D slice (adjacency matrix) of integers where `profits[i][j]` represents the profit GoTel can make by directly connecting city `i` to city `j`. Note that `profits[i][j]` can be negative, indicating a loss. If there is no direct connection possible between city `i` and city `j`, the corresponding value will be `-1000000`. Assume `profits[i][i] = 0` for all cities `i`. The matrix is symmetric, i.e., `profits[i][j] == profits[j][i]`.
*   `min_cities`: The minimum number of cities that GoTel *must* connect to form a valid network.
*   `max_cities`: The maximum number of cities that GoTel can connect to form a valid network.
*   `budget`: GoTel has a limited budget for deploying the fiber optic cables.
*   `costs`: A 2D slice (adjacency matrix) of integers where `costs[i][j]` represents the cost to connect city `i` to city `j`. Note that `costs[i][j]` can be different from `costs[j][i]`. If there is no direct connection possible between city `i` and city `j`, the corresponding value will be `1000000`. Assume `costs[i][i] = 0` for all cities `i`.

Your task is to write a Go function that determines the *maximum* possible profit GoTel can achieve by deploying the fiber optic network, subject to the following constraints:

1.  The network must be a *connected* graph. All cities within the network must be reachable from each other.
2.  The number of cities in the network must be between `min_cities` and `max_cities` (inclusive).
3.  The total cost of deploying the network (sum of the costs of the cables used) must not exceed the given `budget`.
4.  The profit is calculated as the sum of the profits `profits[i][j]` for all pairs of connected cities `i` and `j` in the final network where `i < j`.

If it is impossible to construct a valid network that meets all the constraints, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 25` (Number of cities)
*   `1 <= min_cities <= max_cities <= N`
*   `0 <= budget <= 100000`
*   `-1000 <= profits[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= costs[i][j] <= 1000`
*   Your solution must have a time complexity of at most O(2<sup>N</sup> * N<sup>2</sup>) or better to pass all test cases.
*   The sum of costs could exceed the max int value.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, optimization, and careful handling of constraints. Consider various graph algorithms and optimization techniques to arrive at an efficient solution.  Pay special attention to the connected graph constraint, as it significantly impacts the solution's complexity.  Consider the trade-offs between different approaches.

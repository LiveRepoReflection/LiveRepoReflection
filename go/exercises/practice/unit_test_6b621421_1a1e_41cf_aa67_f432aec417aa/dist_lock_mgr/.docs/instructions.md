`DistributedLockManager`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed lock manager service. This service allows multiple clients, potentially running on different machines, to acquire and release locks on shared resources. The lock manager must ensure mutual exclusion, preventing concurrent access to the same resource by different clients.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Lock Acquisition:** Clients should be able to request a lock on a specific resource (identified by a unique string name). The lock manager should grant the lock to the first client that requests it, if the resource is currently unlocked. If the resource is locked, subsequent requests for the same lock should block until the lock is released.

2.  **Lock Release:** Clients should be able to release a lock they hold on a resource. The lock manager should ensure that only the client that holds the lock can release it.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The lock manager service must be fault-tolerant. If the primary lock manager instance fails, a secondary instance should automatically take over and continue to provide lock management services. This should be transparent to the clients.

4.  **Lock Timeout (Leases):** To prevent deadlocks due to client failures, implement a lock timeout mechanism. If a client holds a lock for longer than a specified timeout, the lock manager should automatically release the lock.  Clients should be able to renew their lock before it expires.

5.  **Concurrency:** The lock manager should be able to handle concurrent lock requests and releases from multiple clients efficiently.

6.  **Scalability:** The lock manager should be designed to handle a large number of resources and clients. Consider sharding the resources across multiple lock manager instances.

7.  **Reentrancy (Optional but Recommended):** Allow a client that already holds a lock on a resource to acquire the same lock again (reentrancy). The lock should only be fully released when the client releases it the same number of times it acquired it.

**Constraints:**

*   **Resource Names:** Resource names are arbitrary strings.
*   **Client Identifiers:** Assume each client has a unique identifier.
*   **Communication:** Choose an appropriate communication protocol (e.g., RPC, gRPC, HTTP) for client-lock manager interaction.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure strong consistency in lock management operations, even in the presence of failures.
*   **Performance:** Minimize latency for lock acquisition and release operations.
*   **Avoid Starvation:** Ensure that no client is indefinitely blocked from acquiring a lock. Implement a fairness mechanism if needed.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the lock manager with concurrent clients and simulated failures.

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   **Data Structures:** Use appropriate data structures to store lock information (e.g., maps, sets).
*   **Concurrency Control:** Use appropriate concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels) to protect shared data structures.
*   **Failure Detection:** Implement a mechanism for detecting failures of the primary lock manager instance.
*   **Leader Election:** Implement a leader election algorithm to choose a new primary instance when the current primary fails (e.g., Raft, Paxos, ZooKeeper-based election).
*   **Sharding (Optional):** If implementing sharding, use a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute resources across shards.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the lock manager correctly enforce mutual exclusion and prevent data races?
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Does the lock manager continue to operate correctly in the presence of failures?
*   **Performance:** How long does it take to acquire and release locks under high load?
*   **Scalability:** How well does the lock manager scale to a large number of resources and clients?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?
*   **Testing:** Are the tests comprehensive and do they cover all important scenarios?

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and fault tolerance. It is designed to be challenging and requires careful planning and implementation. Good luck!

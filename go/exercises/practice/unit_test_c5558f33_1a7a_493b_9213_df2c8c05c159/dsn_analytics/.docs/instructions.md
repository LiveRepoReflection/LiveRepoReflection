## Question: Decentralized Social Network Analytics

### Question Description

You are tasked with building an analytics engine for a decentralized social network (DSN). Unlike traditional social networks, this DSN consists of a collection of independent, peer-to-peer nodes. Each node stores its own user data and connection information. You do not have direct access to all the nodes or global network data.

Your engine must efficiently answer complex analytical queries about the network, given limited access and resources.

**Network Structure:**

*   The DSN is composed of `N` nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`.
*   Each node maintains a list of its direct connections (neighbors). These connections are directed; i.e., node `A` might follow node `B`, but not vice versa.
*   Due to the decentralized nature, you can only query a limited number of nodes directly (using a provided API - see details below). Querying a node is an expensive operation, so minimize the number of queries.
*   The complete graph is not guaranteed to be connected. There may be multiple isolated subgraphs.
*   Node IDs are not guaranteed to be sequential in the actual DSN.

**Data at Each Node:**

Each node contains the following information:

*   `UserID`: A unique string identifier for each user on that node.
*   `Connections`: A list of integer Node IDs representing the nodes to which this node has directed connections.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `AnalyzeDSN(N int, queryNode func(nodeID int) ([]string, []int), targetUserIDs []string) [][]int` in Go that takes the following inputs:

*   `N`: The total number of nodes in the DSN.
*   `queryNode`: A function that allows you to query a specific node. It takes a node ID (integer) as input and returns two slices:
    *   A slice of UserIDs (`[]string`) present on that node.
    *   A slice of node IDs (`[]int`) representing the connections (out edges) of that node.
    If the nodeID is invalid, the queryNode function will return empty slices.
*   `targetUserIDs`: A list of string user IDs for which you need to find the shortest path(s) between any two of them.

Your function should return a 2D slice of integer lists (`[][]int`), where each inner list represents the shortest path (sequence of node IDs) between any two given target user IDs.
If no path exists between a target user ID pair, return an empty list `[]int{}` for that pair.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Shortest Path**: Find the shortest path (minimum number of hops) between any two target user IDs, regardless of which node the users exist on. Consider the directed connections.
2.  **Efficiency**: Minimize the number of calls to `queryNode`. This is the primary optimization goal. Naive solutions that query every node will likely time out.
3.  **Completeness**: Consider all possible paths between target users, even if they span across multiple nodes and isolated subgraphs.
4.  **Scalability**: Your solution must be able to handle a large number of nodes and connections, although the number of target users will be relatively small.
5.  **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where:
    *   A target user ID does not exist in the network.
    *   A node has no connections.
    *   The network is disconnected.
    *   There are duplicate user IDs across different nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
*   `1 <= len(targetUserIDs) <= 10` (Number of target users)
*   The length of `Connections` list for each node can vary.
*   User IDs are non-empty strings.
*   Time Limit: A tight time limit will be enforced. Inefficient solutions will time out.
*   Memory Limit: Reasonable memory constraints apply.

**Example:**

Let's say you have 3 nodes (N=3).

*   Node 0: Users = ["userA", "userB"], Connections = [1]
*   Node 1: Users = ["userC"], Connections = [2]
*   Node 2: Users = ["userD"], Connections = []

If `targetUserIDs` is `["userA", "userD"]`, the output should be `[][]int{{0, 1, 2}}`. This represents the shortest path from userA (on Node 0) to userD (on Node 2).

If `targetUserIDs` is `["userD", "userA"]`, the output should be `[][]int{{}}`. This represents no path exist from userD (on Node 2) to userA (on Node 0).

**Judging:**

Your solution will be judged on correctness (passing all test cases) and efficiency (minimizing the number of calls to `queryNode`).  Solutions that are correct but make excessive calls to `queryNode` may fail due to exceeding the time limit.

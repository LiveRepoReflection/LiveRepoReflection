Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem, designed to be similar in difficulty to a LeetCode Hard problem, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world considerations.

### Question Description

You are designing the routing layer for a distributed key-value store that uses a consensus algorithm (like Raft or Paxos) to ensure data consistency across multiple nodes.  The cluster consists of `N` nodes.  Each node has a unique ID from `0` to `N-1`.

The key-value store has a sharding scheme where keys are hashed and assigned to a primary node responsible for storing the data. However, due to network partitions, node failures, and temporary inconsistencies during consensus, client requests for a key may need to be routed to different nodes before reaching a consistent version of the data.

The network topology is represented as a weighted, directed graph. The nodes of the graph are the nodes in the key-value store cluster.  The weight of an edge `(u, v)` represents the latency (in milliseconds) of sending a request directly from node `u` to node `v`. There is no guarantee that the graph is fully connected. If no path exist between two nodes, it means that these two nodes cannot communicate directly or indirectly.

Your task is to implement a function `FindOptimalRoute` that, given the network graph, the primary node for a key, and a maximum acceptable latency, determines the optimal route for a client request to reach a consistent version of the data.

**Input:**

*   `N` (int): The number of nodes in the cluster.
*   `graph` (map[int]map[int]int): A representation of the network topology. `graph[u][v]` gives the latency (in milliseconds) of sending a request directly from node `u` to node `v`. If `graph[u]` is nil, it means node `u` has no outgoing edges.  If `graph[u][v]` does not exist, it means there is no direct connection from `u` to `v`.
*   `primaryNode` (int): The ID of the primary node responsible for the key.
*   `originNode` (int): The ID of the node where the request originates.
*   `maxLatency` (int): The maximum acceptable end-to-end latency (in milliseconds) for the request.
*   `consistentNodes` ([]int): A list of nodes known to have a consistent version of the data. This list can change over time.

**Output:**

*   `[]int`: An array of node IDs representing the optimal route from the origin node to a consistent node, including the origin and destination nodes. Return `nil` if no route to a consistent node can be found within the `maxLatency`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Optimization:** The optimal route is defined as the route with the *lowest latency* to any node in `consistentNodes`.
*   **Latency Limit:** The total latency of the route must be less than or equal to `maxLatency`.
*   **Node Failure:**  A node might fail and be temporarily unreachable. Your solution should handle cases where a node in `consistentNodes` is unreachable or becomes unreachable during routing.
*   **Dynamic `consistentNodes`:** The list of `consistentNodes` can be small or large and can change rapidly. Your solution should be efficient in the face of frequent updates to this list.
*   **Graph Sparsity:** The graph might be sparse.  Consider algorithms that perform well on sparse graphs.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   The `originNode` might already be in `consistentNodes`.
    *   The `primaryNode` might be in `consistentNodes`.
    *   The graph might be disconnected.
    *   `N` can be large (up to 1000).
    *   Latencies can be up to 1000 ms.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:**  A brute-force approach will likely time out. Aim for an efficient graph traversal algorithm. Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search (if you can define a suitable heuristic).
*   **Real-World Context:** Consider that in a real distributed system, network conditions and the list of `consistentNodes` can change rapidly. Your solution should be as adaptable as possible to these dynamic conditions, although you don't need to implement actual real-time updates within the scope of this coding problem. The aim is to choose data structures/algoritms that can adapt well to these changes.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. It also tests your ability to consider real-world constraints in distributed systems. Good luck!

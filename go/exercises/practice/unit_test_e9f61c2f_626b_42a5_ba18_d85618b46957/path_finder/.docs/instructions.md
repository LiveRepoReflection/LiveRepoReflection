Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Go programming competition problem. Here's the problem description:

**Project Name:** `EfficientPathways`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient route-finding system for a large transportation network. The network consists of `N` locations, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. These locations are connected by bidirectional pathways.  Each pathway has a travel time (an integer) and a cost (also an integer).  Multiple pathways may exist between any two locations.

Your system must handle a large number of route requests. Each request specifies a start location, an end location, a maximum allowable travel time, and a maximum allowable cost.  The goal is to find *the shortest possible travel time* amongst *all* routes that satisfy both the time and cost constraints.

More formally:

Given:

*   `N`: The number of locations in the network.
*   `pathways`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, time, cost)` represents a bidirectional pathway between location `u` and location `v` with the specified travel time and cost.
*   `requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(start, end, max_time, max_cost)` represents a route request.

Your task is to implement a function `findBestRoutes(N int, pathways [][4]int, requests [][4]int) []int` that processes the route requests and returns a list of integers. For each request `(start, end, max_time, max_cost)`, the corresponding element in the output list should be the shortest possible travel time from `start` to `end` that satisfies both the `max_time` and `max_cost` constraints. If no such route exists, the corresponding element should be `-1`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10,000`
*   `0 <= u, v < N` for each pathway.
*   `0 <= start, end < N` for each request.
*   `1 <= time, cost <= 1000` for each pathway.
*   `1 <= max_time, max_cost <= 1,000,000` for each request.
*   The number of `pathways` and `requests` can be large (up to 100,000 each).
*   The graph represented by the `pathways` may not be fully connected.
*   The pathways are bidirectional.  `(u, v, time, cost)` is equivalent to `(v, u, time, cost)`.
*   **Efficiency is critical.** A naive solution that explores all possible routes will likely time out.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.  Think about pre-computation and indexing strategies.
*   The solution should handle edge cases gracefully, such as when the start and end locations are the same, when there are no pathways connecting the start and end locations, or when no routes satisfy the time and cost constraints.
*   Multiple pathways can connect the same two locations. You must consider all of them.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
pathways = [
    [0, 1, 5, 10],
    [0, 2, 3, 5],
    [1, 2, 2, 3],
    [2, 3, 1, 1],
    [1, 3, 4, 8],
]
requests = [
    [0, 3, 10, 15], // start=0, end=3, max_time=10, max_cost=15
    [0, 3, 6, 6],   // start=0, end=3, max_time=6, max_cost=6
    [1, 0, 7, 12],  // start=1, end=0, max_time=7, max_cost=12
]

findBestRoutes(N, pathways, requests) == [6, -1, 5]
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

*   **Request 1 (0, 3, 10, 15):**
    *   Route 1: 0 -> 2 -> 3 (time=3+1=4, cost=5+1=6).  Valid.
    *   Route 2: 0 -> 1 -> 3 (time=5+4=9, cost=10+8=18). Invalid (cost exceeds 15).
    *   Route 3: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (time=5+2+1=8, cost=10+3+1=14). Valid.
    *   The shortest valid time is 4.
*   **Request 2 (0, 3, 6, 6):**
    *   Route 1: 0 -> 2 -> 3 (time=3+1=4, cost=5+1=6).  Valid.
    *   Route 2: 0 -> 1 -> 3 (time=5+4=9, cost=10+8=18). Invalid.
    *   Route 3: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (time=5+2+1=8, cost=10+3+1=14). Invalid.
    *   The shortest valid time is 4.
*   **Request 3 (1, 0, 7, 12):**
    *   Route 1: 1 -> 0 (time=5, cost=10). Valid.
    *   Route 2: 1 -> 2 -> 0 (time=2+3=5, cost=3+5=8). Valid.
    *   The shortest valid time is 5.
This problem requires careful consideration of algorithmic choices and data structure usage to achieve optimal performance within the given constraints. Good luck!

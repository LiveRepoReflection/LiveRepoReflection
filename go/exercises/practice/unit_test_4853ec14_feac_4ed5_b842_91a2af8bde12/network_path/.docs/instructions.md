### Question Description

A large distributed system consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.  Each node represents a service that can communicate directly with a subset of other nodes. The connections between the nodes, and their associated communication costs (latency), are represented by a weighted, undirected graph.  The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each entry `graph[i]` contains a list of `[neighbor, cost]` pairs. The cost represents the latency of communication between node `i` and `neighbor`.

The system must process a stream of requests. Each request is of the form `(source, destination, deadline)`, where `source` and `destination` are node IDs, and `deadline` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed latency for the communication.

Your task is to implement a function `ProcessRequest(graph [][]int, request []int)` that takes the graph and a request as input and determines if the request can be satisfied within the given deadline. If it *can* be satisfied, the function should return the **minimum possible latency** between the source and destination nodes. If it *cannot* be satisfied (no path exists within the deadline), the function should return `-1`.

**However, there's a twist:**

Due to network congestion, the latency of each link in the network *fluctuates over time*.  You are provided with a global `congestionFactor` float64 that represents a multiplicative factor to *all* link latencies at the time of the request.  The effective cost of communicating between node `i` and `neighbor` is thus `cost * congestionFactor`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Size:** The number of nodes `n` can be up to 10,000.
2.  **Connections:** Each node can have up to 100 connections.
3.  **Latency Costs:** Original `cost` values will be integers between 1 and 100.
4.  **Congestion Factor:** `congestionFactor` will be a float64 between 0.5 and 2.0 (inclusive).
5.  **Deadline:** `deadline` will be a positive integer up to 1,000,000.
6.  **Performance:**  Your solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of requests.  A naive solution that recalculates shortest paths for every request will likely time out. Consider the trade-offs between pre-computation and on-demand computation.
7.  **Correctness:** Your solution must correctly handle cases where no path exists, where the deadline is very small, and where the congestion factor significantly alters the network latencies.  Floating-point precision should be handled carefully.
8.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle disconnected graphs.
    *   Handle cases where source and destination are the same node (latency should be 0).
    *   Handle cases with large congestion factors and tight deadlines.
9.  **Optimization:** The goal is to minimize the execution time of `ProcessRequest`, *especially* when dealing with a large number of requests using the same graph. Pre-computation may be helpful, but must be implemented carefully to avoid excessive memory usage or setup time.
10. **Global Variable:** You have access to a global variable `congestionFactor` of type `float64`.  This variable's value changes between subsequent calls to `ProcessRequest`.

**Input:**

*   `graph`:  A 2D slice of integers `[][]int`, where `graph[i]` is a slice of `[neighbor, cost]` pairs representing the connections of node `i`.
*   `request`: A slice of integers `[]int` of length 3, representing `[source, destination, deadline]`.

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the minimum latency if the request can be satisfied within the deadline, or `-1` if it cannot.

**Example:**

```go
graph := [][]int{
    {{1, 10}, {2, 30}}, // Node 0 connects to Node 1 (cost 10) and Node 2 (cost 30)
    {{0, 10}, {2, 20}}, // Node 1 connects to Node 0 (cost 10) and Node 2 (cost 20)
    {{0, 30}, {1, 20}}, // Node 2 connects to Node 0 (cost 30) and Node 1 (cost 20)
}

congestionFactor = 1.0 // Initially set the congestion factor

request1 := []int{0, 2, 50} // Source 0, Destination 2, Deadline 50
result1 := ProcessRequest(graph, request1) // Expected: 30 (direct path)

congestionFactor = 0.5
request2 := []int{0, 2, 20} // Source 0, Destination 2, Deadline 20
result2 := ProcessRequest(graph, request2) // Expected: -1 (0 -> 1 -> 2 costs (10*0.5 + 20*0.5) = 15)

congestionFactor = 1.5
request3 := []int{0, 2, 60} // Source 0, Destination 2, Deadline 60
result3 := ProcessRequest(graph, request3) // Expected: 45 (direct path = 30*1.5)

```

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms (shortest paths), data structures, and careful consideration of performance and edge cases. Good luck!

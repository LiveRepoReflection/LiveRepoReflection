Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization requirements, and a real-world scenario.

## Project Name

`AutonomousVehicleRouting`

## Question Description

Imagine you are designing the routing system for a fleet of autonomous vehicles operating within a large, dynamic urban environment. The city can be represented as a weighted directed graph, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments, with weights representing travel time.

You are given the following:

*   `nodes`: A slice of strings representing the names of the intersections.
*   `edges`: A slice of structs, where each struct represents a directed road segment with a `From` (string, source intersection), `To` (string, destination intersection), and `Weight` (int, travel time in seconds).
*   `vehicles`: A slice of structs, where each struct represents an autonomous vehicle with a `ID` (string, unique identifier), `Start` (string, starting intersection), `End` (string, destination intersection), and `DepartureTime` (int, time in seconds when the vehicle departs).
*   `trafficEvents`: A slice of structs, where each struct represents a traffic event with a `Node` (string, the intersection affected by the event), `StartTime` (int, time in seconds when the event starts), `EndTime` (int, time in seconds when the event ends), and `Delay` (int, additional delay in seconds added to any path going through the node during the event).
*   `queryTime`: An integer representing the specific time (in seconds) for which the route should be determined.  This is necessary for determining if traffic events are active.

Your task is to write a function `FindOptimalRoutes` that takes these inputs and returns a `map[string][]string`, where the key is the vehicle ID and the value is a slice of strings representing the optimal route (sequence of intersection names) for that vehicle at the given `queryTime`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** You must efficiently represent the city as a graph.  Consider using adjacency lists or matrices, but be mindful of memory usage and performance, especially with a large number of nodes and edges.  The graph should be constructed based on the provided `nodes` and `edges`.
2.  **Dynamic Travel Times:** The travel time between intersections is dynamic due to traffic events. Your routing algorithm must consider the `trafficEvents` and adjust the edge weights accordingly for the provided `queryTime`. If a vehicle passes through a node (`trafficEvents.Node`) during a time in which the traffic event is active (`trafficEvents.StartTime` <= `queryTime` <= `trafficEvents.EndTime`), then the travel time along any path through that node should be increased by the `trafficEvents.Delay`.
3.  **Optimal Route:** The goal is to find the route with the *minimum total travel time* for each vehicle.
4.  **Departure Time Consideration:** The vehicles only start moving at their `DepartureTime`. The route must be calculated as if the vehicle is at its `Start` node at `DepartureTime`. The `queryTime` might be before, during, or after the vehicle's travel.
5.  **Large Datasets:** The number of nodes, edges, vehicles, and traffic events can be substantial (e.g., thousands or tens of thousands). Your solution must be optimized for performance.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize runtime complexity.
6.  **No Negative Weights:** Assume no negative edge weights.
7.  **Disconnected Graph:** The graph may not be fully connected. If a vehicle's `Start` and `End` nodes are not reachable, return an empty slice of strings for that vehicle in the result map.
8.  **Edge Cases:** Handle various edge cases, such as:

    *   Empty input slices (`nodes`, `edges`, `vehicles`, `trafficEvents`).
    *   Invalid node names in `edges` or `vehicles` (nodes not present in the `nodes` slice).  You should return an error for these cases and not proceed with routing if any node name is invalid.
    *   Traffic events with overlapping time intervals on the same node.  The delays should be additive.
    *   Vehicles with the same `ID`.
    *   `queryTime` being before any vehicle's `DepartureTime`. In this case, find the route that would be optimal if they were to depart.
    *   Ensure the code doesn't panic under any input.

9.  **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search (if you implement a heuristic) are suitable choices for finding the shortest path. Consider the trade-offs between these algorithms based on the graph's characteristics.
10. **Multiple Valid Routes:** If multiple routes have the same minimum travel time, any of those routes is considered a valid solution.
11. **Real-time Route Updates:** The `queryTime` simulates a real-time scenario where routes need to be calculated quickly based on the current traffic conditions.
12. **Memory Management:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially with large graphs and datasets. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

**Input Structs:**

```go
type Edge struct {
    From   string
    To     string
    Weight int
}

type Vehicle struct {
    ID            string
    Start         string
    End           string
    DepartureTime int
}

type TrafficEvent struct {
    Node      string
    StartTime int
    EndTime   int
    Delay     int
}
```

**Function Signature:**

```go
func FindOptimalRoutes(nodes []string, edges []Edge, vehicles []Vehicle, trafficEvents []TrafficEvent, queryTime int) (map[string][]string, error) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

**Example:**

Let's say you have a city with intersections "A", "B", "C" and roads A->B (weight 10), B->C (weight 15), A->C (weight 30). A vehicle wants to go from A to C, departing at time 0. There's a traffic event at B from time 5 to 15, adding a delay of 20. If the `queryTime` is 7, the route A->B->C would have a total weight of 10 + 20 (delay) + 15 = 45. The route A->C has weight 30. Therefore, the optimal route is A->C. If the queryTime is 2, then the optimal route is still A->B->C with weight 10+15=25.

This problem challenges you to combine graph algorithms, dynamic data, and optimization techniques to solve a real-world problem. Good luck!

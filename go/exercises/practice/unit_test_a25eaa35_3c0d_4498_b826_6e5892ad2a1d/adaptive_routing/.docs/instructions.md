Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description, focused on maximizing difficulty and incorporating the elements you requested.

## Project Name

`AdaptiveRouting`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an adaptive routing system for a dynamic network. The network consists of nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID.  Nodes can communicate directly with a subset of other nodes in the network, forming a directed graph. The network topology is subject to change: links between nodes can appear and disappear at any time, and nodes themselves can join or leave the network.

Your system must provide an API that allows clients to:

1.  **Find the shortest path:** Given a source and destination node ID, find the shortest path (minimum number of hops) between them. If no path exists, indicate that.
2.  **Update network topology:**  Receive notifications of changes in the network topology, specifically:
    *   `AddLink(source, destination int)`: A new directed link is established from `source` to `destination`.
    *   `RemoveLink(source, destination int)`: The directed link from `source` to `destination` is removed.
    *   `AddNode(nodeID int)`: A new node with the given ID joins the network.
    *   `RemoveNode(nodeID int)`: The node with the given ID leaves the network.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Dynamic Network:** The network topology changes frequently. Your routing system must efficiently adapt to these changes. Recomputing the entire graph from scratch on every change is not acceptable.
*   **Scalability:** The network can contain a large number of nodes (up to 100,000) and links. Your implementation must be memory-efficient and performant.
*   **Real-time Performance:** Shortest path queries must be answered quickly (sub-second response time for most queries).
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle disconnected graphs, non-existent nodes, adding/removing links that don't exist, and other potential error conditions gracefully.
*   **Optimization:**  Consider the trade-offs between memory usage, update speed, and query speed.  There are multiple valid approaches, but the goal is to find a balance that performs well under dynamic network conditions.  Pre-computation is allowed, but it must be done in a way that can be efficiently updated.
*   **Concurrency:** The system will be accessed concurrently by multiple clients issuing queries and updates. Your implementation must be thread-safe and avoid race conditions.

**Specific Challenges:**

*   **Efficient Graph Representation:** Choosing the right data structure to represent the network graph is crucial for performance.  Consider adjacency lists or matrices, and their respective trade-offs.
*   **Incremental Updates:**  Implement an algorithm that efficiently updates the routing information in response to topology changes, rather than recomputing everything.  Consider algorithms like Dijkstra's or BFS with modifications for dynamic updates.
*   **Concurrency Control:**  Protect your graph data structure and routing algorithms from concurrent access using appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, read-write locks) while minimizing contention.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to detect and handle cycles in the graph.
*   Implement a caching strategy to speed up frequently requested shortest path queries.

The goal is to create a robust, scalable, and performant adaptive routing system that can handle a highly dynamic network environment. Good luck!

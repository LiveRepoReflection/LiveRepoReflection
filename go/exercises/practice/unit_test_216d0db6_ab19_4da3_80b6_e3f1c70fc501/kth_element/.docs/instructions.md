Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and require efficient algorithms and data structures.

**Project Name:** `DecentralizedAnalytics`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a system for decentralized analytics across a large, distributed network of data nodes. Each data node holds a subset of a massive dataset. Due to privacy concerns and network bandwidth limitations, direct access to the raw data on each node is restricted. Instead, each data node can only perform local computations and communicate summary statistics to a central aggregator.

Specifically, your system needs to efficiently calculate the *k*-th smallest element across the entire dataset without revealing the individual data values held by each node.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Data Nodes:** Assume there are `n` data nodes in the network. Each node `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) holds a sorted array `data[i]` of integers. The sizes of these arrays can vary significantly.  You *do not* have direct access to the `data[i]` arrays; they are conceptually held within the data nodes.

2.  **Central Aggregator:** You are implementing the logic for the central aggregator. This aggregator can communicate with the data nodes to request computations and receive summary statistics.

3.  **Communication Protocol:** The communication between the aggregator and the data nodes must be minimized to reduce network overhead. The aggregator can send a *single* integer parameter to each data node (e.g., a threshold or a rank). The data node then performs a calculation based on this parameter and returns a single integer result to the aggregator.

4.  **Privacy:** The solution must not reveal the precise values of the dataset held on each node. The only information exchanged are counts and bounds.

5.  **Efficiency:** The overall algorithm must be highly efficient, especially for large datasets and a large number of nodes. Solutions with time complexity significantly worse than O(n log m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the maximum size of array in all nodes, will likely time out.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of data nodes.
*   `k`: The rank of the element you need to find (1-indexed).
*   A function `queryNode(nodeID int, value int) int`: This function simulates communication with a data node. When called as `queryNode(i, x)`, it instructs data node `i` to count how many elements in its local `data[i]` array are less than or equal to `x`. It then returns this count.  Crucially, *you do not know the internal implementation of `queryNode` or the contents of `data[i]`*.

**Output:**

*   The *k*-th smallest element in the combined dataset.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= k <= Total Number of elements across all nodes`
*   Each element in `data[i]` is a 32 bit integer.
*   The total number of elements across all nodes can be up to `10^9`
*   Assume `data[i]` on each node `i` is already sorted in ascending order.
*   The solution should be implemented in Go.

**Example:**

Let's say:

*   `n = 3`
*   `k = 5`

And suppose the (hidden) `data` arrays on the nodes are:

*   `data[0] = [1, 5, 9]`
*   `data[1] = [2, 6, 10, 12]`
*   `data[2] = [3, 7, 11]`

The combined sorted dataset would be `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12]`. The 5th smallest element is `6`. Your solution should return `6`.

**Hints:**

*   Binary search is your friend. Think about how you can use binary search to efficiently find the target element.
*   Consider using a helper function to calculate the total number of elements less than or equal to a given value across all nodes.
*   Pay close attention to integer overflow issues.

This problem requires a good understanding of binary search, distributed algorithms, and efficient communication strategies. Good luck!

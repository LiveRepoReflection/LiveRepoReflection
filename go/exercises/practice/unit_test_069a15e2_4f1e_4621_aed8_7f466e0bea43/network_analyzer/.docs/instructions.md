Okay, here's a challenging Go programming problem designed to be difficult and require careful consideration of various factors.

**Project Name:** `ConcurrentNetworkAnalysis`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a concurrent network analyzer.  You will be given a directed graph representing a network. Each node in the graph represents a network device, and each edge represents a network connection between two devices.  The graph is represented as an adjacency list where the keys are node IDs (integers) and the values are lists of node IDs representing the outgoing connections from that node.

Your program needs to perform two types of analysis on this network concurrently:

1.  **Reachability Analysis:**  Given a source node, determine all other nodes reachable from the source node. Implement a function `ReachableNodes(graph map[int][]int, sourceNode int) []int` that returns a sorted slice of reachable node IDs.

2.  **Latency Measurement:**  Simulate sending packets between directly connected nodes and measure the average latency.  You are given a `latencyFunction` (type `func(source, destination int) int`) that simulates the latency between two connected nodes.  This function takes the source and destination node IDs as input and returns the latency in milliseconds. You are given a slice of all edges as `edges` (type `[][]int` where `edges[i][0]` is the source node and `edges[i][1]` is the destination node). Implement a function `AverageLatency(edges [][]int, latencyFunction func(int, int) int, concurrency int) float64`.  This function must calculate the average latency across all provided edges. You *must* implement concurrent processing of the edges, limiting the concurrency to the given `concurrency` parameter. Ensure no race conditions occur when updating the total latency count.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Graph Size:** The graph can contain up to 10,000 nodes.
*   **Concurrency Limit:** The `concurrency` parameter for `AverageLatency` can range from 1 to 100.
*   **Latency Function:** The `latencyFunction` is provided and can return values between 1 and 1000 milliseconds.  It is computationally expensive.
*   **Memory Efficiency:**  The solution should be mindful of memory usage, especially with large graphs. Avoid creating unnecessary copies of the graph.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle invalid inputs gracefully. For example, return an empty slice for `ReachableNodes` if the `sourceNode` does not exist in the graph. Return 0.0 for `AverageLatency` if there are no edges.
*   **Deadlock Avoidance:** Your concurrent implementation *must* avoid deadlocks.
*   **Race Condition Prevention:** Ensure that the concurrent implementation of `AverageLatency` avoids race conditions. Use appropriate synchronization primitives.
*   **Correctness:** Ensure the `ReachableNodes` returns all reachable nodes and *only* reachable nodes.
*   **Efficiency:**  Optimize the `AverageLatency` function to minimize execution time by using the concurrency parameter effectively. The latency function is expensive so avoid calling it more than necessary.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A `map[int][]int` representing the directed graph.
*   `sourceNode`: An `int` representing the starting node for reachability analysis.
*   `edges`: A `[][]int` representing the edges of the graph.
*   `latencyFunction`: A `func(int, int) int` simulating latency between connected nodes.
*   `concurrency`: An `int` representing the maximum number of concurrent goroutines for latency measurement.

**Output:**

*   `ReachableNodes`: A `[]int` containing the sorted list of reachable nodes from the `sourceNode`.
*   `AverageLatency`: A `float64` representing the average latency across all edges.

This problem combines graph algorithms, concurrency, and optimization, making it a challenging task for experienced Go programmers. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithms, optimization, and system design considerations.

**Project Name:** `distributed-data-stream-processor`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed system for processing a high-volume data stream in real-time. The system consists of multiple processing nodes and a central coordinator.

**Data Stream:** The data stream consists of timestamped events, each associated with a specific entity (e.g., a user ID, sensor ID, product ID). The events are unordered and arrive at unpredictable rates. Each event has the following structure:

```go
type Event struct {
    Timestamp int64 // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    EntityID  string
    Value     float64
}
```

**Processing Requirements:**

1.  **Real-time Aggregation:** For each entity, you need to maintain a running average of the `Value` field over a sliding time window of `W` milliseconds.  The system should be able to handle a large number of entities concurrently.

2.  **Distributed Processing:** The data stream is too large to be processed by a single node.  Events should be distributed across multiple worker nodes for parallel processing.  The distribution strategy must ensure that all events for a given `EntityID` are processed by the *same* worker node to maintain accurate running averages.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** Worker nodes may fail.  The system must be designed to automatically recover from worker node failures without significant data loss or service interruption.  This means the running averages must be persisted and recoverable.

4.  **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes as the data stream volume increases.  The coordinator should be able to dynamically rebalance the workload across the available worker nodes.

5.  **Querying:** An external client should be able to query the current running average for a specific `EntityID` at any time. The query should be handled efficiently, with minimal latency.

6.  **Eventual Consistency:** While strongly consistent averages are desirable, eventual consistency is acceptable to prioritize performance and availability. Be prepared to discuss the trade-offs between consistency and performance.

**Specific Implementation Details:**

*   **Coordinator:** Implement a central coordinator that is responsible for:
    *   Assigning `EntityID` ranges to worker nodes.
    *   Detecting worker node failures.
    *   Rebalancing the workload across remaining worker nodes when failures occur or new nodes are added.
    *   Handling client queries for running averages, routing them to the appropriate worker node.
*   **Worker Nodes:** Implement worker nodes that are responsible for:
    *   Receiving events from the data stream.
    *   Maintaining running averages for their assigned `EntityID`s.
    *   Persisting the running averages to a durable storage (e.g., a local file, Redis, or a simple in-memory database that you manage persistence for).
    *   Responding to queries from the coordinator.
*   **Data Distribution:** Choose a suitable hashing function to map `EntityID`s to worker nodes.  Consider strategies for minimizing data movement during rebalancing.
*   **Time Window:** The time window `W` is a configuration parameter.  Your solution should work efficiently for different values of `W`.
*   **Concurrency:**  Your solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent event processing and queries efficiently.
*   **Persistence:** Your persistence mechanism should ensure that the running averages can be recovered quickly after a worker node failure.
*   **Optimization:**  Consider ways to optimize the storage and computation of the running averages.  For example, you might use a circular buffer to store events within the time window, or explore techniques for approximate aggregation.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Memory Usage:**  The system should be designed to minimize memory usage, especially on the worker nodes.  Avoid storing the entire data stream in memory.
*   **Latency:**  The system should be designed to minimize latency for both event processing and query responses.
*   **Throughput:** The system should be able to handle a high volume of events per second.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as network errors, data corruption, and invalid input.
*   **Configuration:** The number of worker nodes and the time window `W` should be configurable without requiring code changes.

**Deliverables:**

*   Well-documented Go code for the coordinator and worker nodes.
*   A description of the data distribution strategy and the rationale behind it.
*   A description of the fault tolerance mechanism and how it ensures data recovery.
*   A discussion of the trade-offs between consistency, latency, and throughput in your design.
*   A brief analysis of the system's scalability and limitations.
*   Basic unit tests (but the emphasis is on system design and architecture).

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems principles, data structures, algorithms, and Go concurrency. Good luck!

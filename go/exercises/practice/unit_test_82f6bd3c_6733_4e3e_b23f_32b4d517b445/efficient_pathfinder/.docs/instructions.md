Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard difficulty question:

**Project Name:** `EfficientPathfinder`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient pathfinding system for a large-scale, dynamically changing transportation network. The network consists of `n` locations, each represented by a unique integer ID from `0` to `n-1`.  The connections between locations are represented by directed edges with associated costs (positive integers). The network's structure and edge costs are not static; they can change at any time due to construction, traffic, or other unforeseen circumstances.

Your system needs to handle a high volume of pathfinding queries. Each query asks for the cheapest (lowest total cost) path between two specified locations, a source `s` and a destination `d`.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

1.  **Dynamic Network:** The system must efficiently handle changes to the network.  Edges can be added, removed, or have their costs updated frequently. These updates should not require a complete recalculation of all possible paths.

2.  **Large Scale:** The number of locations `n` can be very large (up to 10<sup>5</sup>). The number of edges `m` can also be large (up to 10<sup>6</sup>).

3.  **High Query Volume:** The system must be able to handle a high number of pathfinding queries (up to 10<sup>4</sup> queries per second) with low latency.

4.  **Cost Optimization:** The solution must return the path with the absolute minimum cost. If no path exists between the source and destination, it should return `-1`.

5.  **Memory Usage:**  Minimize memory usage to ensure scalability.

6.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Self-loops (edges from a location to itself).
    *   Parallel edges (multiple edges between the same two locations). The system should consider only the lowest cost among parallel edges.
    *   Disconnected components in the network.
    *   Source and destination being the same location (cost should be 0).
    *   Invalid source or destination IDs (return `-1`).
    *   Negative edge costs (return `-1` immediately - do not try to solve it, this input is invalid)

7. **Concurrency:** The system should be designed to handle concurrent updates and queries safely and efficiently.

**Input:**

The system will receive two types of input:

*   **Update Operations:**  These operations modify the transportation network.  Each update is a tuple `(type, u, v, cost)`, where:
    *   `type` is a string: `"add"`, `"remove"`, or `"update"`.
    *   `u` and `v` are integer IDs representing the source and destination locations of an edge.
    *   `cost` is a positive integer representing the cost of the edge.
    *   If `type` is `"remove"`, `cost` is ignored.

*   **Query Operations:** These operations request pathfinding. Each query is a tuple `(s, d)`, where:
    *   `s` is the integer ID of the source location.
    *   `d` is the integer ID of the destination location.

**Output:**

For each query `(s, d)`, the system should output the minimum cost to travel from `s` to `d`. If no path exists, output `-1`.  If a negative edge is added, output `-1` immediately and do not proceed with the solving process.

**Example:**

```
Initial Network: Empty

Updates:
("add", 0, 1, 5)
("add", 1, 2, 3)
("add", 0, 2, 10)
("update", 0, 2, 8)
("remove", 1, 2)

Queries:
(0, 2)  -> Output: 8
(0, 1)  -> Output: 5
(1, 2)  -> Output: -1
(2, 0) -> Output: -1
("add", 2, 1, -1) -> Output: -1
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must consistently return the correct minimum cost for all valid inputs.
*   Efficiency: The solution must meet the performance requirements for update and query operations.  Solutions with high time complexity will not pass all test cases.
*   Memory Usage: The solution must not consume excessive memory.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Concurrency Safety: The solution must handle concurrent operations correctly.

This problem requires a careful selection of data structures and algorithms to achieve the necessary performance.  Consider using techniques like:

*   Efficient graph representations (e.g., adjacency lists).
*   Dynamic shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, or potentially more advanced techniques if you can incrementally update shortest paths).
*   Caching strategies (with careful invalidation) to speed up repeated queries.
*   Appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety.

Okay, here is a coding problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated in Go, targeting a difficulty level similar to LeetCode Hard.

**Project Name:** `TimeBasedKeyStore`

**Question Description:**

Design a time-based key-value storage system that supports the following operations:

1.  **Set(key string, value string, timestamp int):** Stores the `value` for the given `key` at the given `timestamp`.

2.  **Get(key string, timestamp int) string:** Retrieves a value for the given `key` that has a timestamp less than or equal to the given `timestamp`.

    *   If there are multiple values stored with timestamps less than or equal to the given `timestamp`, it should return the value with the **largest** (most recent) timestamp.
    *   If there is no value stored with a timestamp less than or equal to the given `timestamp`, it should return an empty string (`""`).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   All timestamps will be strictly increasing for a given key. That is, if `Set(key, value1, ts1)` and `Set(key, value2, ts2)` are called, then `ts1 < ts2` must hold true.
*   Keys and values are non-empty strings.
*   Timestamps are positive integers.
*   The system must be highly efficient for both `Set` and `Get` operations, especially for `Get` operations on keys with a large number of stored values across a wide range of timestamps. Consider the time complexity of your solution.
*   Your solution should be concurrent-safe. Multiple goroutines might call `Set` and `Get` concurrently for the same or different keys.
*   Minimize memory usage. Avoid storing redundant or unnecessary data.
*   The system should be able to handle a large number of keys and a large number of values per key.
*   Consider the trade-offs between memory usage, time complexity for `Set` and `Get`, and concurrency safety. There are multiple valid approaches, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
*   The storage system must handle out-of-order requests gracefully. For example, if `Get(key, ts)` is called before any `Set(key, value, ts2)` calls where `ts2 <= ts`, the `Get` method should still return `""`.
*   Assume timestamps are Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch).
*   You are expected to implement the time-based key-value store from scratch. Do not use external libraries that implement the core functionality. You may use standard Go libraries for concurrency control, data structures, and other utility functions.

**Example:**

```go
timeMap := Constructor()
timeMap.Set("foo", "bar", 1)
timeMap.Get("foo", 1)     // Returns "bar"
timeMap.Get("foo", 3)     // Returns "bar"
timeMap.Set("foo", "bar2", 4)
timeMap.Get("foo", 4)     // Returns "bar2"
timeMap.Get("foo", 5)     // Returns "bar2"
timeMap.Get("foo", 2)     // Returns "bar"
timeMap.Get("bar", 5)     // Returns ""
```

**Challenge:**

This problem challenges the solver to consider various data structures and algorithms, including but not limited to:

*   Hash maps (for key lookup)
*   Sorted data structures (e.g., binary search trees, skip lists, or sorted arrays) for efficient timestamp-based retrieval.
*   Concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, read-write locks) for safe concurrent access.
*   Optimization techniques to minimize memory footprint and improve performance.

The problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles. The constraints force the solver to carefully consider the trade-offs between different approaches and to optimize their solution for both time and space complexity.  The sheer number of potential edge cases and requirements makes this a challenging problem with numerous opportunities for subtle bugs.

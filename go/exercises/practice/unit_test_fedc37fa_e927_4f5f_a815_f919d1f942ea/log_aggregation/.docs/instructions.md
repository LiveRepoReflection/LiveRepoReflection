Okay, here's a challenging Go programming competition problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard level. It incorporates advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization requirements, and a real-world scenario.

### Question Description

You are designing a distributed system for aggregating logs from a large number of services. Each service generates log entries with timestamps and severity levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`). These services are distributed across multiple data centers.

Your task is to implement a system that efficiently collects and aggregates these logs, allowing users to query for log entries within a specified time range and severity level, **grouped by data center**.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Log Entry Structure:** A log entry consists of:

    *   `Timestamp` (Unix timestamp in nanoseconds - `int64`)
    *   `DataCenter` (string representing the data center, e.g., "us-east-1", "eu-west-2")
    *   `Severity` (string representing the severity level, e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR")
    *   `Message` (string containing the log message)

2.  **Data Ingestion:** Implement a function `IngestLog(logEntry LogEntry)` that receives log entries and stores them efficiently. The system should be able to handle a high volume of incoming log entries.  Assume `LogEntry` is a struct defined as described above.

3.  **Querying:** Implement a function `QueryLogs(startTime int64, endTime int64, severity string) map[string][]LogEntry` that retrieves all log entries:

    *   within the specified time range (`startTime` and `endTime` are Unix timestamps in nanoseconds). The range is inclusive, so logs with `startTime` and `endTime` should be returned.
    *   with the specified `severity` level (case-sensitive).
    *   The function should return a map where the key is the `DataCenter` and the value is a slice of `LogEntry` objects matching the query criteria, sorted by `Timestamp` in ascending order.
    *   If no logs match the criteria, return an empty map.

4.  **Memory Constraints:**  The system has limited memory.  You **cannot** load the entire log data into memory at once during querying.  Consider how to efficiently store and retrieve the data.

5.  **Time Complexity:**  The `QueryLogs` function should be optimized for performance.  Na√Øve solutions that iterate through all ingested logs will likely time out.  Consider appropriate indexing strategies.

6.  **Concurrency:** The `IngestLog` and `QueryLogs` functions may be called concurrently from multiple goroutines. Ensure your implementation is thread-safe.

7.  **Severity Levels:** Assume the severity levels are a fixed set: `"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, `"WARN"`, `"ERROR"`.

8.  **Data Centers:** The number of data centers is not known in advance and can grow over time.

**Constraints:**

*   The system must handle a large number of log entries (millions or billions).
*   The time range for queries can be very large.
*   The system should be memory-efficient.
*   The `QueryLogs` function must return results quickly.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to persist the log data to disk (e.g., using a file-based or database storage).
*   Implement a caching mechanism to improve query performance for frequently accessed time ranges and severity levels.
*   Consider how to handle out-of-order log entries (entries that arrive with timestamps earlier than existing entries).

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, indexing, concurrency, and optimization techniques to achieve the required performance and memory efficiency. Good luck!

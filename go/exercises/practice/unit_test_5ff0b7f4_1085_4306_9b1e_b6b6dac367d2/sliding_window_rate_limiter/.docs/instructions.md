Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

`Distributed Rate Limiter with Sliding Window`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service using Go. This service will be deployed across multiple servers and must accurately limit requests based on a sliding window algorithm.

**Context:**

Imagine you are building a popular API. To protect your infrastructure from abuse and ensure fair usage, you need to implement rate limiting.  A simple rate limiter might use a fixed window (e.g., allow 100 requests per minute). However, fixed windows can lead to bursts of traffic at the window boundaries. A sliding window provides a smoother rate limiting experience by considering a rolling time window.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Sliding Window Algorithm:** Implement a sliding window rate limiting algorithm.  The rate limiter should track requests within a time window and allow new requests only if the total number of requests within that window is below a defined threshold.

2.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must function correctly even when deployed across multiple servers. This implies the need for a shared data store to maintain a consistent view of request counts across all servers.  Consider using an external data store like Redis, Memcached, or a custom distributed data structure to achieve this.

3.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter service must be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients. Ensure that your implementation is thread-safe and avoids race conditions.

4.  **Atomic Operations:** When incrementing request counts in the shared data store, ensure that the operations are atomic to prevent inconsistencies in a concurrent environment.

5.  **Time Precision:** The rate limiter should function with millisecond precision. The sliding window should accurately reflect the time of the requests within milliseconds.

6.  **Expiration:** Implement a mechanism to automatically expire old request entries in the sliding window to prevent the data store from growing indefinitely.  Consider using Time-To-Live (TTL) features of your chosen data store.

7.  **Performance:** The rate limiter should be highly performant and introduce minimal latency to request processing. The data structure and algorithms used should be optimized for speed.

8.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be designed to scale horizontally. The data store and service architecture should be able to handle increasing request volumes by adding more servers.

9.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle failures in the data store or other parts of the system.

10. **Configuration:** The rate limiter should be configurable with parameters such as:
    *   `Request Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed within the window.
    *   `Window Size`: The duration of the sliding window (e.g., 1 minute, 1 hour).
    *   `Data Store Address`: The address of the shared data store (e.g., Redis server).

**Input:**

The rate limiter receives requests, each identified by a unique client ID (e.g., a user ID or API key).

**Output:**

For each request, the rate limiter should return:

*   `true`: If the request is allowed (i.e., it does not exceed the rate limit).
*   `false`: If the request is rejected (i.e., it exceeds the rate limit).

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be implemented in Go.
*   The solution must use a shared data store for distributed operation.
*   The solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests correctly.
*   The solution must be performant and scalable.
*   The solution must handle errors gracefully.

**Example:**

Let's say the configuration is: `Request Limit = 10`, `Window Size = 1 minute`.

1.  Client A sends 10 requests within the first 30 seconds of the minute.  All requests are allowed.
2.  Client A sends another request at 31 seconds. This request is rejected because the limit of 10 requests within the 1-minute window has been reached.
3.  After 30 more seconds (at the start of the next minute), the requests from the first 30 seconds of the *previous* minute have effectively "slid out" of the window. Client A can now send more requests.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, data structures, and algorithms. It's designed to test the candidate's ability to design a robust, scalable, and performant rate limiter service. Good luck!

Okay, here is a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and push the solver to their limits.

## Project Title:  Scalable Event Stream Aggregator

### Question Description:

You are tasked with building a scalable and efficient event stream aggregator.  Imagine a high-volume system that receives a continuous stream of events. Each event contains the following information:

*   `timestamp` (Unix timestamp in seconds - int64)
*   `event_type` (string - representing different categories of events)
*   `entity_id` (string - representing the identifier of the entity the event relates to)
*   `value` (float64 - a numerical value associated with the event)

Your aggregator needs to perform the following operations:

1.  **Ingest:** Efficiently ingest and store incoming events.  The system should be able to handle a very high rate of incoming events.

2.  **Aggregate:**  Calculate the sum of `value` for each `entity_id` within a specified time window for a specific `event_type`.

3.  **Query:** Given an `event_type`, an `entity_id`, a `start_timestamp`, and an `end_timestamp`, return the aggregated sum of `value` for that `entity_id` and `event_type` within the specified timestamp range (inclusive).

4.  **Concurrency:** The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent ingest and query operations efficiently.

5.  **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing event volumes and query loads. While you don't need to implement actual distribution, you need to design your data structures and algorithms with scalability in mind. Consider how you would shard data, handle data consistency, and minimize lock contention in a distributed environment.

6.  **Memory Management:**  You have a limited amount of memory. Design your solution to minimize memory footprint.  Consider using techniques like data summarization or approximate aggregation if necessary to reduce memory usage while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

7.  **Persistence (Optional but Recommended):** For resilience, the system should persist events to disk.  Optimize the persistence strategy for both write and read performance. Consider using techniques like write-ahead logging or batching writes.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Time Complexity:**  Query operations must be performant, ideally close to O(log N) or better, where N is the number of events for a particular entity within a relevant timeframe.  Brute-force scanning of all events for an entity is not acceptable.
*   **Memory Usage:**  The system should strive to minimize memory usage.  Consider techniques for data summarization or eviction of older data if necessary.
*   **Concurrency:**  The system must be fully thread-safe.  Use appropriate synchronization primitives to prevent race conditions.
*   **Scalability:**  Design the system with horizontal scalability in mind. Consider sharding strategies, data replication, and minimizing inter-node communication.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.  The system should not crash under unexpected conditions.
*   **Real-world accuracy** While not mandatory for submission, Bonus points for considering strategies when real-world event streams might have delayed or out-of-order events. How would your design handle late-arriving data points?

**Input Format (for Ingest):**

The `Ingest` function will receive an event struct:

```go
type Event struct {
    Timestamp  int64
    EventType  string
    EntityID   string
    Value      float64
}
```

**Input Format (for Query):**

The `Query` function will receive the following parameters:

*   `eventType` (string)
*   `entityID` (string)
*   `startTimestamp` (int64)
*   `endTimestamp` (int64)

**Output Format (for Query):**

The `Query` function should return the aggregated sum (float64) and an error if any.

**Focus Areas:**

*   Choice of appropriate data structures (e.g., in-memory databases, trees, sorted lists, or time-series databases) to efficiently store and retrieve events.
*   Efficient indexing strategies for fast querying.
*   Concurrency control mechanisms to ensure thread safety and minimize lock contention.
*   Scalability considerations for handling large datasets and high query loads.
*   Memory management techniques to minimize memory footprint.
*   Data persistence strategy.
*   Handle out-of-order or late-arriving event scenarios.

This problem demands a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, scalability, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

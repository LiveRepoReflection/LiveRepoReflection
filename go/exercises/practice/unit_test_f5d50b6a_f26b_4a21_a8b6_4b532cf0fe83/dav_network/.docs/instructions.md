Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to push the limits of a competitive programmer.

## Question: Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle (DAV) Network Optimization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the routing and resource allocation for a Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle (DAV) network.  Imagine a city where autonomous vehicles (DAVs) transport both passengers and goods.  Each DAV has limited capacity (both passenger and cargo space), battery life, and processing power. The city is represented as a weighted, undirected graph. Nodes represent locations (intersections, depots, etc.), and edges represent roads with associated travel times (weights).

A set of transport requests arrive continuously. Each request specifies:

*   A start location (node ID).
*   A destination location (node ID).
*   A required transport type (passenger, cargo, or both).
*   A required quantity (number of passengers or cargo weight).
*   A deadline (time after which the request is invalid).
*   A reward for completing the request.

The DAV network operates under the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity:** Each DAV has a maximum passenger capacity (`passengerCapacity`) and a maximum cargo capacity (`cargoCapacity`).
2.  **Battery Life:** Each DAV has a maximum battery life represented as travel time units (`maxBattery`). Traveling an edge consumes battery life equal to the edge weight. Each node has a charging station that instantly refills a DAV's battery.
3.  **Processing Power:** Each DAV has a processing power limit (`processingPower`). Handling each request consumes processing power.  The amount of processing power consumed depends on the distance between the start and end nodes of the request. Further requests can only be picked up after the last request has been delivered to the destination node to avoid unnecessary complexity.
4.  **Time Constraints:** DAVs must complete requests before their deadlines.
5.  **Decentralization:** While you have a centralized view for optimization purposes during the competition, the ultimate goal is to simulate a decentralized system. DAVs make routing decisions independently based on your algorithm.

Your task is to design an algorithm in Go that maximizes the total reward earned by the DAV network within a given time window (`simulationTime`). You need to determine:

*   Which DAV should handle which request(s).
*   The optimal route for each DAV to pick up and deliver its assigned requests.
*   The order in which a DAV should handle multiple requests if assigned more than one.

**Input:**

Your program will receive the following input:

1.  **Graph Description:** A list of nodes and edges represented as an adjacency list. Nodes will be represented by integer IDs. Edges will be represented as tuples: `(node1_id, node2_id, travel_time)`.
2.  **DAV Descriptions:** A list of DAVs, each described by its starting location (node ID), `passengerCapacity`, `cargoCapacity`, `maxBattery`, and `processingPower`.
3.  **Request Stream:** A continuous stream of transport requests. Each request is described as a tuple: `(request_id, start_node_id, end_node_id, transport_type, quantity, deadline, reward)`. Transport type will be an enum (e.g., `PASSENGER`, `CARGO`, `BOTH`).

The input stream will be provided in a structured format (e.g., JSON, protocol buffers, or a custom format).  Your program must be able to handle the continuous arrival of requests.

**Output:**

Your program should output a sequence of actions for each DAV. Each action should specify:

*   `dav_id`: The ID of the DAV performing the action.
*   `action_type`:  (`PICKUP`, `DELIVER`, `IDLE`)
*   `request_id`: The ID of the request being handled (if `PICKUP` or `DELIVER`).
*   `path`: A list of node IDs representing the route the DAV should take to reach the pickup or delivery location (if `PICKUP` or `DELIVER`). If `IDLE`, path should be an empty list.

The output should be formatted in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** The graph can be large (thousands of nodes and edges).
*   **Real-time:** Your algorithm must make decisions quickly as requests arrive.  There will be a strict time limit for processing each set of requests within the `simulationTime`.
*   **Optimality:** Aim for the highest possible total reward within the simulation time.
*   **Feasibility:**  All actions must be feasible within the DAV's constraints (capacity, battery life, processing power, deadlines). Infeasible solutions will be penalized (negative reward).
*   **Collision Avoidance:** Assume DAVs can pass each other without delay, but two DAVs cannot occupy the same node simultaneously. If two DAVs arrive at the same node at the same time, the collision will cause both DAVs to be delayed for a given penalty time.
*   **Request Cancellation:** Requests can be cancelled with a penalty.

**Scoring:**

The score will be the total reward earned by the DAV network, minus penalties for infeasible actions, collisions, and cancelled requests.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using efficient graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search for route planning.
*   Explore heuristics and approximation algorithms to make quick decisions.
*   Think about how to efficiently manage the continuous stream of requests.
*   Parallelism could be crucial for performance.
*   Consider using a priority queue to manage the requests based on urgency (deadline, reward).
*   You may need to balance exploration (accepting new requests) with exploitation (completing existing requests).
*   Dynamic programming techniques might be applicable for optimizing the order of requests for a single DAV.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, data structure expertise, and efficient Go coding. Good luck!

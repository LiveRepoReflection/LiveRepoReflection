Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed with the constraints and requirements you specified:

### Project Name

`AutonomousNavigation`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a navigation system for an autonomous vehicle operating within a complex, dynamic environment represented as a weighted directed graph. The graph's nodes represent locations, and the edges represent traversable routes between locations, with weights indicating the estimated travel time along each route.

The vehicle starts at a designated source node and needs to reach a specific destination node.  However, the environment is not static.  Certain routes (edges) can become temporarily blocked due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., accidents, construction), and new routes (edges) can become available.  These changes are communicated to your system as a stream of events.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Dynamic Graph Representation:** Implement a data structure to efficiently represent the weighted directed graph and allow for dynamic modifications (edge additions and removals).  Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and performance for graph operations.

2.  **Event Processing:** Design a mechanism to process a stream of events that describe changes to the graph. Each event will specify either:
    *   `BlockEdge(source, destination)`: Indicates that the edge from `source` to `destination` is now blocked and cannot be traversed.
    *   `UnblockEdge(source, destination, weight)`: Indicates that the edge from `source` to `destination` is now open and has a travel time of `weight`.
    *   `AddEdge(source, destination, weight)`: Indicates that a new edge from `source` to `destination` is now available and has a travel time of `weight`.

3.  **Real-time Pathfinding:** After each event is processed, your system must be able to quickly determine the shortest (fastest) path from the source to the destination, considering the current state of the graph (blocked and unblocked edges). You should use an efficient pathfinding algorithm like Dijkstra's or A*.

4.  **Optimization:**  The system should be optimized for both memory and time efficiency.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize the time taken to process events and find the shortest path. Implement appropriate optimizations to the pathfinding algorithm given real-world road network characteristics. For example, road networks are often sparse.

5.  **Edge Case Handling:**

    *   Handle the case where there is no path from the source to the destination. Return appropriate error in this case.
    *   Handle the case where the source or destination node does not exist in the graph. Return appropriate error in this case.
    *   Handle duplicate events (e.g., receiving `BlockEdge(A, B)` multiple times). The system should not crash or produce incorrect results.
    *   Weights are positive integers.
    *   Nodes are identified by string names.

6. **Concurrency**: The event processing and pathfinding must be thread-safe. Many events can be processed at the same time, and the pathfinding requests can occur at any time.

**Input:**

*   Initial graph represented as a list of edges: `[][]string{{"A", "B", "10"}, {"B", "C", "15"}, {"A", "C", "50"}}`, where the first two strings are source and destination node names, and the third string is the weight of the edge.
*   Source node: `"A"`
*   Destination node: `"C"`
*   A stream of events, represented as a slice of strings: `[][]string{{"BlockEdge", "A", "B"}, {"UnblockEdge", "A", "B", "20"}, {"AddEdge", "A", "D", "5"}, {"BlockEdge", "A", "C"}}`

**Output:**

*   For each event, return the shortest path from source to destination as a list of node names: `[]string{"A", "C"}` along the path, or an error if no path exists. If an error is returned, the path array should be nil.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can have a large number of nodes and edges (e.g., up to 100,000 nodes and 500,000 edges).
*   The event stream can be very long (e.g., millions of events).
*   The system must be able to process events and find the shortest path quickly (e.g., within milliseconds) to ensure real-time responsiveness.

This problem challenges the solver to design a robust, efficient, and scalable navigation system that can handle dynamic environments and real-time constraints, making it a demanding exercise in algorithm design, data structures, and system optimization.  The concurrency requirement adds another layer of complexity. Good luck!

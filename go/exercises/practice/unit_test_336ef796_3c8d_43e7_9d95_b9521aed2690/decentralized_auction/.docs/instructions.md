Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and complex, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

**Project Name:** `DecentralizedAuction`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified decentralized auction system on a blockchain.  The system will handle multiple concurrent auctions for unique digital assets (NFTs). The core functionality involves placing bids, determining auction winners, and transferring ownership of the NFTs.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Auction Structure:** Each auction has a unique ID, an NFT being auctioned (represented by a unique string identifier), a starting price, a duration (in blocks), and a creator (address, represented by a string).

2.  **Bidding:** Any participant can place a bid on an auction. Each bid includes the auction ID, the bidder's address, and the bid amount. Bids must be higher than the current highest bid (or the starting price if no bids exist yet). Only the highest bid is stored for each auction.

3.  **Auction End:** An auction ends after its defined duration (number of blocks) has elapsed.  When an auction ends, the highest bidder is declared the winner, and the NFT is transferred to them.  The previous owner (the creator of the auction) receives the winning bid amount. If no bids were placed during the auction duration, the NFT remains with the creator.

4.  **Concurrency:** Multiple auctions can run concurrently. Your solution must handle concurrent bids and auction endings correctly.

5.  **Data Storage:** Implement an efficient data structure to store the auction data (auction details, bids, etc.) within a blockchain-like environment. Assume that storing data is computationally expensive (emulate by adding a time delay to write operations if needed).

6.  **Gas Optimization:** Implement the logic with gas (computation resources) efficiency in mind.  Penalties will be applied for solutions that consume excessive resources. Minimize storage writes and loop iterations.

7.  **Reentrancy Protection:**  Implement protection against reentrancy attacks. A malicious bidder might attempt to trigger unexpected behavior during the NFT transfer or payment process.

8.  **Time Handling:**  The "current block number" is provided as input to functions that require knowing the current time.  Assume block numbers increase linearly.

9. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. Throw appropriate errors and prevent invalid state transitions.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Immutability:** Once an auction is created, its starting price, duration, and NFT identifier cannot be changed.
*   **No External Calls:** Your solution must operate within the simulated blockchain environment. You cannot make external API calls or rely on external libraries for core logic (except for basic data structures).
*   **Scalability:** While not explicitly measured, consider the scalability of your solution. How would it perform with a large number of concurrent auctions and frequent bidding activity?
*   **Security:** Beyond reentrancy, consider potential security vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
*   **Deterministic Execution:** Your solution must be deterministic. Given the same inputs and initial state, it must produce the same output every time.

**Input/Output:**

The problem will be evaluated through a series of function calls representing interactions with the auction system:

*   `CreateAuction(auctionID string, nftID string, startingPrice int, duration int, creator string, currentBlock int) error` : Creates a new auction. Returns an error if the auction ID already exists or if any of the input parameters are invalid.

*   `PlaceBid(auctionID string, bidder string, bidAmount int, currentBlock int) error`: Places a bid on an existing auction. Returns an error if the auction does not exist, if the bid is not high enough, or if the auction has already ended.

*   `EndAuction(auctionID string, currentBlock int) (string, int, error)`: Ends the auction. Returns the winning bidder's address and the winning bid amount. Returns an empty string and 0 if no bids were placed. Returns an error if the auction does not exist or has already ended. Also handles the NFT transfer and payment.

*   `GetNFTOwner(nftID string) string`: Returns the current owner of the NFT.

**Success Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The auction system must function according to the specified rules and constraints.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be computationally efficient and avoid excessive resource consumption.
*   Security: The solution must be resistant to common security vulnerabilities.
*   Code Clarity: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a deep understanding of concurrency, data structures, and blockchain principles. It encourages the use of efficient algorithms and careful consideration of security implications. Good luck!

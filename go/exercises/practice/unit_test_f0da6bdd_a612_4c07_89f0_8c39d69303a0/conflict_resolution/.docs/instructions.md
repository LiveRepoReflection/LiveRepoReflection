Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be similar in difficulty to a LeetCode Hard problem, focusing on advanced data structures, optimization, and real-world relevance.

## Problem Title:  Distributed Transaction Conflict Resolution

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing a system for managing distributed transactions across a network of `N` nodes (numbered from `0` to `N-1`). Each node maintains its own local database.  To ensure data consistency, transactions that modify data across multiple nodes must be atomic â€“ either all changes are applied, or none are.

Transactions are represented as follows:

```go
type Transaction struct {
    ID          int       // Unique Transaction ID
    Operations  []Operation // List of operations this transaction performs
}

type Operation struct {
    NodeID    int    // ID of the node where the operation is performed
    Key       string // Key of the data being modified
    Value     string // New value to be written (empty string for read-only operations)
    OpType    string // "READ", "WRITE"
}
```

Due to network latency and concurrent transaction processing, conflicts can arise. A conflict occurs when two transactions, running concurrently, attempt to modify the *same key* on the *same node*, and at least one of the transactions is a `WRITE` operation. Your system must detect and resolve these conflicts to maintain data consistency.

**Your task is to implement a function that analyzes a log of transactions and identifies and resolves conflicts according to the following rules:**

1.  **Conflict Detection:**  Scan the transaction log and identify any conflicting transactions as defined above.
2.  **Conflict Resolution:**  When a conflict is detected between two transactions, the transaction with the *lower* `ID` has priority and proceeds. The conflicting operations of the *higher* `ID` transaction are rolled back on the affected node. This means the changes made by the lower ID transaction will persist, while the conflicting changes of the higher ID transaction will not.  A transaction can have multiple conflicts across different nodes.
3.  **Log Analysis:** After applying the conflict resolution, return a map where the keys are node IDs and the values are maps. The inner maps represent the final key-value pairs in the node's database after all committed and rolled back transactions.

**Function Signature:**

```go
func ResolveConflicts(transactions []Transaction, numNodes int) map[int]map[string]string
```

**Input:**

*   `transactions`: A slice of `Transaction` structs representing the transaction log. Transactions arrive in an arbitrary order.  Assume transaction IDs are unique.
*   `numNodes`: An integer representing the total number of nodes in the system.

**Output:**

*   A `map[int]map[string]string` representing the final state of each node's database. The outer map's key is the node ID, and the inner map's key-value pairs represent the data stored in that node.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and memory, especially when dealing with a large number of transactions and nodes.  Consider optimizing your data structures and algorithms.
*   **Concurrency:** While you don't need to implement actual concurrent execution, your solution should be designed with concurrency in mind.  Think about how your data structures would handle concurrent access in a real-world distributed system.
*   **Error Handling:**  While explicit error handling is not required, your code should be robust and handle unexpected input gracefully.
*   **Transaction Order:** The transactions in the input slice are not guaranteed to be in any particular order (e.g., arrival time, transaction ID).
*   **Node Initialization:**  Assume that each node starts with an empty database (an empty map of key-value pairs).
*   **Read Operations:** Read operations do not cause conflicts. They should be reflected in the final output if they read the latest written value.
*   **No Deadlocks:**  You do not need to handle deadlocks.  The conflict resolution strategy is designed to prevent them.

**Example:**

Let's say we have two nodes (numNodes = 2) and the following transactions:

```
Transaction 1:
    Operation 1: NodeID = 0, Key = "x", Value = "10", OpType = "WRITE"

Transaction 2:
    Operation 1: NodeID = 0, Key = "x", Value = "20", OpType = "WRITE"
```

`ResolveConflicts` should return:

```
{
    0: {"x": "10"}, // Because transaction 1 has a lower ID and wins the conflict.
    1: {}, // Node 1 has no transactions affecting it.
}
```

**This problem requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and the challenges of distributed systems. It encourages you to think about efficiency, scalability, and conflict resolution in a real-world context. Good luck!**

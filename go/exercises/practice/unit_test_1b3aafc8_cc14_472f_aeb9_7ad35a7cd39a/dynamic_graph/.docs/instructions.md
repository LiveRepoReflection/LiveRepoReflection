Okay, here's a challenging problem for a Go programming competition, designed to test algorithmic skills, data structure knowledge, and optimization abilities.

### Project Name

`DynamicGraphPaths`

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a system to efficiently answer pathfinding queries on a dynamically changing graph. The graph represents a network of interconnected nodes, where each node has a unique integer ID. Edges between nodes are weighted and directed. The graph's structure and edge weights are subject to frequent updates.

Your system must support the following operations:

1.  **`AddNode(nodeID int)`:** Adds a new node to the graph. If a node with the given ID already exists, the operation should be ignored.

2.  **`RemoveNode(nodeID int)`:** Removes a node from the graph. All edges connected to this node (both incoming and outgoing) must also be removed. If the node does not exist, the operation should be ignored.

3.  **`AddEdge(sourceNodeID int, destinationNodeID int, weight int)`:** Adds a directed edge from `sourceNodeID` to `destinationNodeID` with the given `weight`. If the edge already exists, update its weight. If either node does not exist, the operation should be ignored. Weights can be positive, negative, or zero.

4.  **`RemoveEdge(sourceNodeID int, destinationNodeID int)`:** Removes the directed edge from `sourceNodeID` to `destinationNodeID`. If the edge does not exist, the operation should be ignored. If either node does not exist, the operation should be ignored.

5.  **`ShortestPath(startNodeID int, endNodeID int)`:** Calculates and returns the shortest path distance from `startNodeID` to `endNodeID`. If no path exists, return `math.MaxInt`. If either node does not exist, return `math.MaxInt`. Your solution must be able to handle negative edge weights, but you can assume that there will not be any negative weight cycles in the graph.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes will not exceed 10,000.
*   The number of edges will not exceed 50,000.
*   Node IDs are integers within the range \[0, 100,000].
*   Edge weights are integers within the range \[-1,000, 1,000].
*   The number of operations (add/remove node/edge, shortest path queries) will be up to 100,000.
*   The operations are given in a random order.
*   The shortest path function must be efficient. Simple brute-force solutions will likely time out.
*   The goal is to minimize the average time complexity of the `ShortestPath` operation, given the dynamic nature of the graph.
*   You can preprocess the graph at any time, but the time limit for any single operation should be reasonable. (e.g., ShortestPath should not take minutes to compute after some updates.)

**Performance Requirements:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on its correctness and performance. Specifically, the `ShortestPath` queries should be answered as efficiently as possible, considering the frequent graph updates.  Solutions that consistently time out for larger test cases will not be accepted.  Pay close attention to algorithmic complexity and consider appropriate data structures for optimal performance.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about how graph updates affect shortest path calculations.
*   Can you use caching or pre-computation techniques to speed up pathfinding?
*   Which shortest path algorithm is most suitable given the constraints and dynamics of the graph?
*   How do you efficiently represent the graph to allow for fast edge/node addition and removal?
*   How do you avoid potential memory leaks or excessive memory usage with frequent graph updates?

Good luck!

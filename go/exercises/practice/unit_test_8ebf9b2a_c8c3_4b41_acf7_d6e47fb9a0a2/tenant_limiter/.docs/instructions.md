## Question: Multi-Tenant Rate Limiter

**Description:**

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service in Go that operates in a multi-tenant environment. Each tenant (identified by a unique string `tenantID`) has its own independent rate limits. The rate limiter must be highly available, scalable, and efficient in handling a large number of requests from numerous tenants concurrently.

**Functionality:**

Implement the following function:

```go
// Allow checks if a request from the given tenant is allowed based on its rate limit.
// It returns true if the request is allowed, and false otherwise.
// If the request is allowed, the rate limiter should atomically increment the request count for that tenant.
//
// tenantID: A string identifying the tenant making the request.
// rateLimit: The maximum number of requests allowed per window for the tenant.
// window: The time window in seconds for the rate limit (e.g., 60 for 60 seconds).
//
// Implement this function to be thread-safe and goroutine-safe.
func Allow(tenantID string, rateLimit int, window int) bool {
	// Your implementation here
}
```

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **High Concurrency:** The rate limiter should handle a very high number of concurrent requests from different tenants without significant performance degradation.
2.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing load.  Consider how you would distribute the state across multiple instances.
3.  **Persistence:**  Rate limit data needs to persist across restarts of the service. Consider how you would store this data and recover from failures. You can assume a key-value store (e.g., Redis) is available.
4.  **Atomicity:** Incrementing the request count for a tenant must be atomic to prevent race conditions and ensure accurate rate limiting.
5.  **Accuracy:**  The rate limiter should provide accurate rate limiting within a reasonable margin of error, even under high load and potential clock drift.
6.  **Efficiency:** Optimize for both memory usage and CPU usage. Avoid unnecessary allocations and computations.
7.  **Time Window Management:** The rate limiter must accurately track and reset the request count for each tenant at the end of each time window.  Consider the trade-offs between different windowing strategies (e.g., fixed window, sliding window).
8.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:

    *   `rateLimit` or `window` being zero or negative.
    *   Very large values for `rateLimit` or `window` that could lead to integer overflows.
    *   Sudden spikes in traffic from a tenant.
9. **Minimize Latency:** Each `Allow` call should have very low latency.
10. **Implement the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache to minimize external data access.** You need to determine a reasonable capacity for the LRU cache, balancing memory usage with cache hit rate.

**Considerations:**

*   Discuss the trade-offs of different data structures and algorithms you considered.
*   Explain how you would handle distributed locking and synchronization.
*   Describe how you would monitor and alert on rate limiting metrics.
*   Discuss the implications of clock synchronization issues in a distributed environment and how you would mitigate them.
*   Consider different rate limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window counter, sliding window log).

This problem requires a well-thought-out design and implementation, considering various factors that impact performance, scalability, and reliability. A naive solution will likely fail under high load or exhibit inaccuracies.

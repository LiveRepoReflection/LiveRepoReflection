## Project Name

`Scalable Social Network Reachability`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a highly scalable system to determine the reachability between users in a massive social network.  The social network consists of users and directed relationships (following).  Determining if a user A can reach user B means there exists a directed path from A to B.

The social network is so large that it cannot be fully loaded into memory on a single machine. The user base is constantly growing, and the relationships between them are frequently updated.  Therefore, any solution must be able to handle a large number of users and relationships, and it must also be able to efficiently answer reachability queries in real-time.

**Input:**

Your program will receive two types of inputs:

1.  **Relationship Updates:** These updates represent changes in the social network's relationships. Each update consists of two user IDs, `A` and `B`, indicating that user `A` now follows user `B`.  These updates can arrive frequently and need to be processed efficiently. The removal of the relationships is not considered.

2.  **Reachability Queries:** These queries ask whether user `A` can reach user `B`. Your program must respond to these queries quickly.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle billions of users and relationships.
*   **Real-time Response:** Reachability queries must be answered with minimal latency (ideally sub-second).
*   **Memory Constraints:** You cannot load the entire social network graph into memory at once.
*   **Update Frequency:** The system must be able to handle a high volume of relationship updates.
*   User IDs are represented as 64-bit integers.
*   The number of reachability queries is also high.
*   Assume the system will run on a distributed infrastructure.

**Task:**

Implement a system that can efficiently process relationship updates and answer reachability queries.  Your solution should focus on:

*   **Data Representation:** How to store the social network's relationships in a distributed and scalable manner.
*   **Update Handling:** How to efficiently process relationship updates and keep the data consistent.
*   **Query Processing:** How to quickly determine reachability between two users, given the distributed data.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose appropriate graph algorithms (or approximations) that can be efficiently distributed.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about data partitioning strategies (e.g., sharding) to distribute the graph across multiple machines.
*   Explore techniques for indexing the graph data to speed up query processing.
*   Consider using caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed reachability information.
*   Think about eventual consistency vs strong consistency and the trade-offs.
*   Explore various graph processing frameworks or databases suitable for this task (e.g., graph databases, distributed key-value stores).
*   Consider using Bloom filters or similar techniques to approximate reachability.
*   You do not need to implement the low-level distributed infrastructure. Instead, focus on the high-level design and algorithms that would be used within such a system, and explain the trade-offs of your design decisions.
*   Explain how your system would handle concurrent updates and queries.

**Deliverables:**

1.  A detailed description of your system's architecture, including data representation, update handling, and query processing mechanisms.
2.  Justification for your algorithm and data structure choices, considering scalability, performance, and memory constraints.
3.  A discussion of potential performance bottlenecks and how to mitigate them.
4.  A brief explanation of how your system could be deployed and managed in a distributed environment.
5.  A complexity analysis of update and query operations.

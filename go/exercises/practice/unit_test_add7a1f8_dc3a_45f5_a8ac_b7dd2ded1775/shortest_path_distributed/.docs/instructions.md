## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed system for calculating shortest paths in a very large, dynamically changing graph.  The graph represents a social network where nodes are users, and edges represent relationships (friendships, follows, etc.). The graph is far too large to fit in the memory of a single machine and is distributed across multiple machines (nodes) in a cluster.

Each machine in the cluster is responsible for storing and managing a subset of the graph's nodes and their adjacent edges. Each machine has limited computational resources (CPU, memory) and network bandwidth.

Your task is to implement a function `calculateShortestPath(startNode, endNode)` that efficiently determines the shortest path (in terms of the number of hops) between two given nodes, `startNode` and `endNode`, in the distributed graph.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Distributed Graph Representation:** You do not have direct access to the entire graph. You must interact with other machines in the cluster to discover and traverse the graph. Assume each machine has a function `getNeighbors(node)` that returns a list of the node IDs of the immediate neighbors of a given node ID *on that specific machine*.  This function call has network overhead and latency.
2.  **Dynamic Graph:** The graph is subject to frequent updates (nodes and edges being added or removed).  Your solution should be reasonably resilient to these changes.  (You don't need to handle concurrent modifications *during* a single path calculation, but your algorithm should be able to provide reasonably accurate results even if the graph has changed slightly since the calculation started.)
3.  **Optimization:** Minimize network traffic and the number of `getNeighbors(node)` calls to reduce latency and resource consumption.  Suboptimal solutions that make excessive network requests will be penalized.  Consider the trade-offs between memory usage, computational complexity, and network communication.
4.  **Scalability:** Your solution should be designed to scale to graphs with millions or billions of nodes distributed across many machines.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** While full fault tolerance is not required, consider how your solution might behave if a small number of machines in the cluster become temporarily unavailable. Your algorithm should not completely fail if one or two machines are down.
6.  **Asynchronous Communication:** Assume communication between machines is asynchronous. You might send a request to a remote machine and receive the response later.
7.  **Node Location:** Assume you have a mechanism to determine which machine is responsible for storing a given node (e.g., a consistent hashing scheme). A function `getNodeLocation(node)` is available, returning the machine ID that manages the node.
8.  **Large Node ID Space:** Node IDs are 64-bit integers.
9.  **No Centralized Coordination:** Avoid relying on a single centralized component for coordinating the pathfinding process. This could become a bottleneck and single point of failure.
10. **Memory Constraints:** Each machine has a limited amount of memory. Avoid storing the entire graph structure in memory.

**Input:**

*   `startNode` (64-bit integer): The ID of the starting node.
*   `endNode` (64-bit integer): The ID of the destination node.

**Output:**

*   A list of 64-bit integers representing the shortest path from `startNode` to `endNode` (inclusive of both start and end nodes). Return an empty list if no path exists.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Does it reliably find the shortest path when one exists?
*   **Efficiency:** How quickly does it find the path, especially for large graphs?  Minimize network traffic and CPU usage.
*   **Scalability:** Does it handle large graphs with reasonable resource consumption?
*   **Resilience:** Does it gracefully handle node unavailability?
*   **Code Quality:**  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This is a challenging problem that requires careful consideration of distributed systems principles, graph algorithms, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

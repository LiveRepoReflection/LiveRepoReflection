### Question Description

A large-scale distributed system consists of `n` nodes, uniquely identified by integers from `0` to `n-1`. These nodes are interconnected via a network. The network's initial topology is represented by an adjacency matrix `adjMatrix` where `adjMatrix[i][j] = true` if there is a direct connection between node `i` and node `j`, and `false` otherwise. The matrix is symmetric (if `i` is connected to `j`, then `j` is connected to `i`) and `adjMatrix[i][i] = false` (no self-loops).

Due to changing traffic patterns, the system needs to be reconfigured to optimize communication. A target network topology is provided as another adjacency matrix `targetAdjMatrix` following the same format as `adjMatrix`.

The reconfiguration process involves adding or removing direct connections between nodes. Each addition or removal of a connection has a cost associated with it. Adding a connection between nodes `i` and `j` costs `costAdd[i][j]`, and removing a connection between nodes `i` and `j` costs `costRemove[i][j]`. The cost matrices are also symmetric, and the cost of adding or removing a self-loop is 0 (although self-loops should never exist in a valid solution). If a connection needs to be added, but `costAdd[i][j]` is -1, then adding that connection is impossible. Similarly, if a connection needs to be removed, but `costRemove[i][j]` is -1, then removing that connection is impossible.

Your task is to write a function that calculates the *minimum* cost to transform the initial network topology `adjMatrix` into the target topology `targetAdjMatrix`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 50` (Number of nodes).
*   `adjMatrix`, `targetAdjMatrix`, `costAdd`, and `costRemove` are all `n x n` matrices.
*   Matrix elements are boolean for adjacency matrices.
*   Cost matrix elements are integers between -1 and 1000 (inclusive), with -1 representing infinity.
*   The network is undirected.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient. Naive exhaustive search will time out. Consider using dynamic programming or graph algorithms like min-cost flow.
*   The matrices passed as input are valid (symmetric, no self-loops).
*   It is guaranteed that at least one valid solution exists, unless `costAdd[i][j]` or `costRemove[i][j]` is -1 and no other valid solution exists.

**Input:**

*   `adjMatrix`: `[][]bool` (Initial adjacency matrix)
*   `targetAdjMatrix`: `[][]bool` (Target adjacency matrix)
*   `costAdd`: `[][]int` (Cost to add a connection)
*   `costRemove`: `[][]int` (Cost to remove a connection)

**Output:**

*   `int`: The minimum cost to transform the network.

**Example:**

```go
adjMatrix := [][]bool{{false, true}, {true, false}}
targetAdjMatrix := [][]bool{{true, false}, {false, true}}
costAdd := [][]int{{0, 5}, {5, 0}}
costRemove := [][]int{{0, 2}, {2, 0}}

// Expected output: 7 (Remove existing connection (cost 2) and add the other (cost 5))
```

**Difficulty Considerations:**

*   The relatively small size of `n` might suggest that a more exhaustive approach is possible, but the number of possible connections grows quadratically.
*   The -1 cost (representing infinity) adds complexity to the cost calculations.
*   The need to find the *minimum* cost necessitates careful algorithmic design.
*   The problem is similar to an assignment problem or a min-cost flow problem on a small graph. The solver needs to recognize this and apply the appropriate algorithm.
*   Careful implementation will be needed to avoid common errors.

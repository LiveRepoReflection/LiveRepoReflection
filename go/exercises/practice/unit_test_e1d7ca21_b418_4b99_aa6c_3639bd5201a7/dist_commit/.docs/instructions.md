Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging in Go, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world constraints.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Commit

**Question Description:**

You are designing a distributed database system.  A transaction in this system might involve updates across multiple shards (database partitions). To ensure atomicity (all-or-nothing guarantee), you need to implement a 2-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

Your task is to implement a simplified version of the coordinator in this 2PC protocol. The coordinator is responsible for orchestrating the commit or abort of a distributed transaction.

**Input:**

The input is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing dependencies between shards involved in the transaction. Each node in the graph represents a shard. An edge from shard `A` to shard `B` signifies that shard `A` must commit before shard `B` can commit. This dependency is crucial for data consistency. The DAG is provided in the following format:

1.  **Number of Shards (N):** An integer representing the total number of shards, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.
2.  **Dependencies (M):** An integer representing the number of dependencies (edges) in the DAG.
3.  **Edge List:** `M` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v`, representing a directed edge from shard `u` to shard `v`.
4.  **Shard States (S):**  A list of `N` strings, each representing the initial state of a shard. The possible states are:
    *   `"READY"`: The shard is ready to commit.
    *   `"FAILED"`: The shard has already failed and cannot commit.  If *any* shard is in the `"FAILED"` state at the start, the entire transaction *must* abort.
5.  **Network Latency Matrix (L):** An `N x N` matrix where `L[i][j]` represents the estimated network latency (in milliseconds) for communication between shard `i` and shard `j`.  If there is no direct communication ever required between shard `i` and shard `j`, `L[i][j]` will be `-1`.

**Output:**

Your program must determine the optimal commit/abort strategy and output the following:

1.  **Decision:** A string, either `"COMMIT"` or `"ABORT"`.  If any shard is `"FAILED"` initially, or if any shard votes to abort during the protocol execution (implied below), the decision *must* be `"ABORT"`.
2.  **Total Latency:**  An integer representing the *minimum* total network latency (in milliseconds) incurred during the commit/abort process, according to your strategy.  If the decision is `"ABORT"` due to an initial `"FAILED"` shard, the latency is `0`.

**2PC Protocol (Simplified):**

1.  **Pre-Commit Phase (Coordinator -> Shards):** The coordinator sends a "PREPARE" message to all shards.  Assume this message is always successfully delivered.  The latency of sending a "PREPARE" message from the coordinator (assume it's shard `0`) to shard `i` is `L[0][i]`. Assume shards will always vote to commit if they are in the `"READY"` state.

2.  **Commit/Abort Phase (Coordinator -> Shards):**
    *   If the coordinator decides to `"COMMIT"` (and no shard was initially `"FAILED"`), it sends a "COMMIT" message to each shard.  The latency of sending a "COMMIT" message from the coordinator (shard `0`) to shard `i` is `L[0][i]`. **Shards must commit in topological order according to the DAG.** That means a shard can only be sent the `COMMIT` message after all its dependencies have been committed. The latency of sending the commit message to a shard can only be counted after all of its dependencies have been committed.
    *   If the coordinator decides to `"ABORT"`, it sends an "ABORT" message to each shard.  The latency of sending an "ABORT" message from the coordinator (shard `0`) to shard `i` is `L[0][i]`. This can be done in parallel to all shards.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of shards)
*   `0 <= M <= N * (N - 1) / 2` (Number of dependencies)
*   `0 <= L[i][j] <= 1000` (Network latency in milliseconds, -1 if no communication)
*   Assume shard `0` is always the coordinator.
*   The input DAG is guaranteed to be acyclic.

**Optimization Requirement:**

Minimize the total network latency for the commit/abort process.  Consider the dependencies between shards when determining the optimal commit order to minimize latency.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty DAG (no dependencies).
*   All shards are `"READY"`.
*   One or more shards are `"FAILED"` initially.
*   High network latency between the coordinator and some shards.
*   Complex dependency graph.

**Example Input:**

```
4
3
0 1
0 2
1 3
READY
READY
READY
READY
-1 0 5 2
0 -1 1 -1
5 1 -1 1
2 -1 1 -1
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

*   4 shards (0, 1, 2, 3)
*   3 dependencies: 0 -> 1, 0 -> 2, 1 -> 3
*   All shards are initially "READY"
*   Latency matrix:  L[0][1] = 0, L[0][2] = 5, L[0][3] = 2, L[1][2] = 1, L[2][1] = 1, L[1][3] = -1, L[3][1] = -1, L[2][3] = 1, L[3][2] = 1. Note that L[0][0], L[1][1], L[2][2], and L[3][3] are -1, since a shard never needs to communicate with itself, and there are no direct communication between Shard 1 and Shard 3, or Shard 0 and Shard 0.

**Expected Output (for the example):**

```
COMMIT
9
```

**Reasoning for the Example Output:**

1.  All shards are `"READY"`, so the decision is `"COMMIT"`.
2.  Optimal commit order is:
    *   Send "PREPARE" to all shards: latency = max(0, 5, 2) = 5
    *   Commit shard 0 (coordinator - implicit, no latency)
    *   Commit shard 1 (depends on shard 0): latency = 0
    *   Commit shard 2 (depends on shard 0): latency = 0 + 5 = 5
    *   Commit shard 3 (depends on shard 1): latency = 0+0+2 = 2
    Total latency = 5 + 0 + 2 = 9

**Challenging Aspects:**

*   **Finding the Optimal Commit Order:**  The dependencies introduce a topological order constraint, but there might be multiple valid topological orders.  You need to find the order that minimizes latency. A simple topological sort might not be optimal if some shards have high latency to the coordinator.
*   **Optimization:**  Efficiently calculating the total latency for different commit orderings is crucial for larger inputs.  A brute-force approach will likely time out.
*   **Real-World Scenario:** This problem mirrors the complexities of distributed systems and transaction management.
*   **Multiple Valid Approaches:**  Dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or a combination of approaches could be used. The trade-offs between these approaches in terms of complexity and performance need to be considered.

Good luck! Let me know if you want any clarifications (within the constraints of not giving away the solution!).

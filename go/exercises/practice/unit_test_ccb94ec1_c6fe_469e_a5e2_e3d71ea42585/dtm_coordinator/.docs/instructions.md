Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition:

### Project Name

`distributed-transaction-manager`

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, yet robust, Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture.  The system is responsible for ensuring atomicity across multiple independent services, implementing the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

Imagine you have several microservices (Service A, Service B, Service C, etc.) each managing its own database. A single logical transaction might require updates across multiple services. Your DTM must guarantee that either all updates succeed (commit) or all updates fail (rollback), even in the presence of network failures, service crashes, or other unforeseen issues.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Coordination:** Implement the core 2PC protocol.
    *   The DTM acts as the coordinator.
    *   Microservices act as participants.
    *   The DTM should support `BeginTransaction`, `CommitTransaction`, and `RollbackTransaction` operations.
2.  **Communication:**  Services communicate with the DTM via gRPC. Define appropriate gRPC service definitions.
3.  **Persistence:** The DTM *must* persist the transaction state (e.g., pending, committed, rolled back) and the list of participating services for each transaction.  Use an embedded key-value store (e.g., BadgerDB, BoltDB) for this purpose.  Consider how to handle concurrent access to the data.
4.  **Idempotency:**  Ensure all operations (especially commit and rollback) are idempotent. Services might receive the same commit/rollback command multiple times due to network issues.
5.  **Timeout Handling:** Implement timeouts for all stages of the 2PC protocol (e.g., prepare phase, commit phase).  If a service doesn't respond within the timeout, the DTM should automatically rollback the transaction.
6.  **Concurrency:** The DTM should handle multiple concurrent transactions efficiently.  Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent data corruption.
7.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.  The DTM should log errors, retry operations where appropriate, and provide meaningful error messages to clients.
8.  **Service Registration:** Microservices need a way to register themselves with the DTM, indicating their participation in a specific transaction.
9.  **Commit/Rollback Confirmation:** Microservices should confirm successful commit or rollback to the DTM. The DTM needs to handle cases where some services successfully commit/rollback, but others fail to confirm.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be written in Go.
*   Minimize external dependencies.  Focus on using the standard library and a single embedded key-value store.
*   Maximize performance and scalability. The DTM should be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions.
*   Consider potential failure scenarios (e.g., DTM crash during commit, service crash during rollback) and design your solution to be resilient.
*   The solution needs to be thread-safe.

**Bonus (Advanced):**

*   Implement a recovery mechanism for the DTM.  If the DTM crashes and restarts, it should be able to recover its state and complete any pending transactions.
*   Implement distributed tracing (e.g., using OpenTelemetry) to track transactions across multiple services.
*   Implement a deadlock detection mechanism.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, error handling, and database principles.  It also tests the candidate's ability to design and implement a complex system from scratch. Good luck!

## Project Name

`DistributedKeyCounter`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed key-value counter service. This service is responsible for maintaining counts of various keys across a cluster of machines. The service must be highly available, scalable, and provide strong consistency guarantees.

Specifically, the service should support the following operations:

*   `Increment(key string, value int)`: Increments the counter associated with the given `key` by `value`. The increment must be durable, meaning that it should survive machine failures.
*   `Get(key string)`: Returns the current count associated with the given `key`. The returned count must reflect all previously acknowledged `Increment` operations.
*   `TopK(k int)`: Returns the `k` keys with the highest counts, in descending order of count. If multiple keys have the same count, they should be sorted lexicographically.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   **Distribution:** The service should be distributed across multiple nodes to handle high traffic and ensure fault tolerance. You need to design a sharding strategy to distribute keys across these nodes. Consider the trade-offs between different sharding strategies (e.g., consistent hashing, range partitioning).
*   **Replication:**  Data should be replicated across multiple nodes to ensure high availability and durability. Choose a suitable replication strategy (e.g., primary-backup, multi-leader) and explain its implications for consistency and performance.
*   **Consistency:** The service must provide strong consistency guarantees.  All clients should see the same, up-to-date counts, regardless of which node they interact with.  Implement a consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos, or a simplified version with clear justification) to ensure that all replicas agree on the order of operations.
*   **Concurrency:**  The service must handle concurrent `Increment` and `Get` operations correctly.  Implement appropriate locking or concurrency control mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  Implement the `Increment`, `Get`, and `TopK` operations.
2.  Implement a sharding mechanism to distribute keys across a configurable number of nodes.
3.  Implement a replication mechanism to replicate data across a configurable number of replicas.
4.  Implement a consensus protocol to ensure strong consistency.
5.  Address potential race conditions and concurrency issues.
6.  Implement optimizations to improve performance (e.g., caching frequently accessed keys).

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The number of keys can be very large (billions).
*   The number of nodes in the cluster can vary.
*   The service must be resilient to node failures.
*   `Increment` operations should be atomic and durable.
*   `Get` operations should return the latest committed value.
*   The `TopK` operation should be efficient, even with a large number of keys.
*   Consider the impact of network latency and potential network partitions.
*   Ensure proper error handling and logging.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Optimize for both read (Get, TopK) and write (Increment) performance.
*   Minimize latency and maximize throughput.
*   Efficient memory usage is important, given the potentially large number of keys.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The service must provide accurate counts and adhere to the specified consistency guarantees.
*   Performance: The service must handle a high volume of requests with low latency.
*   Scalability: The service must be able to scale horizontally by adding more nodes.
*   Fault tolerance: The service must be resilient to node failures.
*   Code quality: The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   System design: The overall system design should be sound and well-justified.

This is a challenging problem that requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, and algorithms.  Successfully solving it will demonstrate your ability to design and implement a robust and scalable distributed service. Good luck!

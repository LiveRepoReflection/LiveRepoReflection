Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem:

**Question:**

**Network Partitioning for Optimal Resource Allocation**

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a network partitioning algorithm for a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each representing a computational resource. These nodes are interconnected, forming a complex network topology. The goal is to divide this network into `K` disjoint partitions, minimizing the communication overhead between partitions while ensuring that each partition has a relatively balanced load.

Each node `i` has a `load` value, `L[i]`, representing its current utilization.  The communication cost between two nodes `i` and `j` is given by `C[i][j]`, which is non-negative. If nodes `i` and `j` are in the same partition, their communication cost is considered internal and doesn't contribute to the inter-partition overhead. If they are in different partitions, `C[i][j]` contributes to the inter-partition communication cost.

The quality of a partitioning is evaluated based on two primary criteria:

1.  **Inter-Partition Communication Cost:** The sum of communication costs between all pairs of nodes that belong to different partitions.  This needs to be minimized.

2.  **Load Balance:** The difference between the maximum and minimum total load across all partitions.  This needs to be minimized.

Your task is to write a function `PartitionNetwork(N int, K int, L []int, C [][]int) []int` that takes the number of nodes `N`, the desired number of partitions `K`, the load of each node `L`, and the communication cost matrix `C` as input and returns a partitioning scheme.

The partitioning scheme should be represented as a slice of integers `P` of length `N`, where `P[i]` indicates the partition number (0 to K-1) to which node `i` belongs.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `1 <= K <= min(N, 10)`
*   `0 <= L[i] <= 100` for all `i`
*   `0 <= C[i][j] <= 1000` for all `i`, `j`
*   `C[i][j] == C[j][i]` for all `i`, `j` (communication cost is symmetric)
*   `C[i][i] == 0` for all `i` (no cost to communicate with itself)
*   The goal is to minimize both inter-partition communication cost and load imbalance. There may not be a single perfect solution; aim for a reasonable trade-off.  Solutions will be evaluated based on a weighted sum of these two factors.
*   The time limit for execution is strict (e.g., 5 seconds). Inefficient solutions will likely time out.
*   Memory usage should be reasonable. Avoid allocating extremely large data structures unnecessarily.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on a scoring function that considers both the inter-partition communication cost and the load imbalance. The scoring function will be:

`Score = InterPartitionCommunicationCost + Weight * LoadImbalance`

where `Weight` is a constant (e.g., 10000) that determines the relative importance of load balance compared to communication cost.  The goal is to minimize this score.

**Example:**

Let's say you have:

`N = 4`
`K = 2`
`L = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
`C = [[0, 5, 10, 15], [5, 0, 7, 12], [10, 7, 0, 3], [15, 12, 3, 0]]`

A possible solution could be:

`P = [0, 0, 1, 1]`

This means nodes 0 and 1 are in partition 0, and nodes 2 and 3 are in partition 1.

This example is simple; the challenge lies in finding a good partitioning for larger, more complex networks within the time constraints.

Good luck!

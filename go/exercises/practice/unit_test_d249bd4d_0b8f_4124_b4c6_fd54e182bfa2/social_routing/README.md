# Decentralized Social Network Routing

This problem simulates routing messages in a decentralized social network built on a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture. Users are nodes in the network, and their connections represent friendships. The challenge is to find the most efficient path to route a message from one user to another, respecting various constraints.

## Implementation

Implement the `FindRoutePath` function according to the provided requirements. The function should determine the shortest valid path between users in the network, considering friend connections, blacklisted users, and a maximum hop limit.

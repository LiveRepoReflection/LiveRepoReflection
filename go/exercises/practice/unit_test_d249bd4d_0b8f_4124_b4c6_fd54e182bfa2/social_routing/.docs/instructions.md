## Problem: Decentralized Social Network Routing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a routing algorithm for a decentralized social network built on a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture. In this network, users are nodes, and connections between users represent friendships. There is no central server managing the network; each node only knows a limited subset of other nodes in the network (its immediate neighbors).

The challenge is to efficiently route messages between users who are not directly connected, mimicking how information propagates through real-world social networks. The network's topology is dynamic; users can join, leave, and form new connections at any time.

**Input:**

*   `network`: A representation of the social network.  This will be provided as a map where the key is the user ID (string) and the value is a slice of their directly connected friends' IDs (also strings).
*   `startUser`: The ID (string) of the user initiating the message.
*   `endUser`: The ID (string) of the user the message needs to reach.
*   `maxHops`: An integer representing the maximum number of hops the message can take before being considered undeliverable. This limits the search space and prevents messages from looping indefinitely.
*   `blacklist`: A slice of user IDs (strings) that cannot be traversed. This reflects users who are temporarily offline or have blocked the message sender.

**Output:**

A slice of strings representing the shortest path (sequence of user IDs) the message should take from `startUser` to `endUser`.

*   If a path is found within `maxHops`, return the path including both the `startUser` and `endUser`.
*   If no path is found within `maxHops`, return an empty slice (`[]`).
*   If `startUser` is the same as `endUser`, return a slice containing only `startUser`.
*   If `startUser` or `endUser` do not exist in the network, return an empty slice (`[]`).

**Constraints:**

*   The network can be large (potentially thousands of users).
*   Each user has a limited view of the network (only knows their direct neighbors).
*   The network topology is dynamic (users can join/leave/connect).
*   Message routing must be efficient (find the shortest path or determine that no path exists within `maxHops`).
*   The solution must handle cycles in the network graph.
*   The solution must respect the `maxHops` constraint to prevent infinite loops.
*   The solution must respect the `blacklist`.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the number of hops the message takes to reach the destination. While not required to be absolutely optimal due to the decentralized nature, strive for a reasonably short path.
*   The solution should be reasonably efficient in terms of time complexity, especially for larger networks.

**Real-World Considerations (Implicit Requirements):**

*   This problem simulates the challenges of routing information in decentralized systems.  Real-world systems must deal with network churn (users joining/leaving), limited knowledge of the network topology, and the need for efficient message delivery.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph traversal algorithms (BFS or similar), data structures for efficient queue management, and the ability to handle constraints and edge cases effectively. The combination of a large network, limited knowledge, and the `maxHops` constraint makes this a challenging problem that requires careful design and implementation.

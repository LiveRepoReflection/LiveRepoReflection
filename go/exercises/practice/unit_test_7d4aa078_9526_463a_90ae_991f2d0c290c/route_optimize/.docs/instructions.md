Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description, designed to be difficult and require careful consideration of various aspects:

## Project Name

`OptimalRoutePlanner`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient route planner for a delivery service operating in a large city. The city is represented as a weighted directed graph, where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent delivery locations. Each location has a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`, where `N` is the total number of locations.
*   **Edges:** Represent roads connecting locations. Each edge has a `cost` (integer) representing the travel time along that road, and a `priority` (integer). Higher `priority` means the road is better to travel by. There can be multiple edges between the same two nodes, but each should have a unique `priority` value.

Your service receives delivery requests with the following information:

*   **`start`**: The ID of the starting location.
*   **`end`**: The ID of the destination location.
*   **`deadline`**: An integer representing the latest time the delivery can arrive at the destination.

You need to implement a function `FindOptimalRoute(graph map[int][]Edge, start int, end int, deadline int) []int` that finds the optimal route from `start` to `end` within the given `deadline`. The `graph` represents the city's road network. The `Edge` struct is defined as:

```go
type Edge struct {
    To       int
    Cost     int
    Priority int
}
```

The "optimal route" is defined as follows:

1.  **Feasibility:** The total cost (travel time) of the route must be less than or equal to the `deadline`.
2.  **Priority Optimization:** Among all feasible routes, the route with the **highest minimum edge priority** is preferred.  In other words, the route should avoid edges with low priority as much as possible. For example, if route A has edge priorities \[5, 7, 6] and route B has edge priorities \[4, 8, 9], then route A is better (min priority 5 > min priority 4).
3.  **Cost Minimization (Tie-breaker):** If multiple feasible routes have the same highest minimum edge priority, choose the route with the **lowest total cost**.
4.  **Shortest Route (Further Tie-breaker):** If multiple feasible routes have the same highest minimum edge priority AND the same total cost, choose the route with the fewest number of edges (shortest route).

The function should return:

*   A slice of integers representing the IDs of the locations visited in the optimal route, including the `start` and `end` locations, in the correct order.
*   An empty slice if no feasible route exists within the given `deadline`.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= N <= 1000` (Number of locations)
*   `0 <= start, end < N`
*   `0 <= deadline <= 10000`
*   `1 <= Cost <= 100` for each edge
*   `1 <= Priority <= 100` for each edge
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   The graph may be disconnected (no path exists between some locations).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient enough to handle a large number of delivery requests in a timely manner. Consider the time complexity of your algorithm.
*   Memory usage should also be optimized. Avoid storing unnecessary data.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   `start` and `end` are the same location.
*   No route exists between `start` and `end`.
*   Multiple routes exist with the same minimum priority and total cost.
*   The graph contains negative cycles (although costs are always positive, logical errors can produce them if the algorithm is not carefully designed).

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Imagine this function being part of a larger system that handles thousands of delivery requests per minute. How would you design the data structures and algorithms to ensure scalability and performance? (This is not directly tested in the code, but should influence your design choices).

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal algorithms, careful handling of edge cases, and optimization techniques to find the truly optimal route under the given constraints. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard level, incorporating the elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `DistributedTransactionSimulator`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with simulating a distributed transaction system across multiple nodes.  Imagine you are building a simplified version of a system that ensures atomicity and consistency across geographically distributed databases.

The system consists of `N` nodes, each representing a database server.  Each node has a unique ID from `0` to `N-1`. Transactions involve operations on multiple nodes.  A transaction proceeds in two phases: Prepare and Commit/Rollback.

1.  **Prepare Phase:** A transaction coordinator sends a "prepare" message to all nodes involved in the transaction. Each node then attempts to tentatively perform its part of the transaction.  It either successfully prepares (and locks the necessary resources), or it fails to prepare due to various reasons (e.g., resource contention, data validation failure).  A node that prepares successfully sends an "ACK" back to the coordinator. A node that fails sends a "NACK."

2.  **Commit/Rollback Phase:**

    *   If the coordinator receives "ACK" from *all* involved nodes, it sends a "commit" message to all nodes.  Each node then permanently applies the changes.
    *   If the coordinator receives *any* "NACK," it sends a "rollback" message to all involved nodes.  Each node then discards any tentative changes and releases any locks.

**Your Task:**

Implement a simulator for this distributed transaction system.  You are given the following:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the system.
*   `transactions`: A slice of transactions. Each transaction is represented as a struct containing:
    *   `ID`: A unique identifier for the transaction (string).
    *   `involvedNodes`: A slice of node IDs (integers) involved in the transaction.
    *   `operation`: A string representing the operation that the transaction performs on each involved node. This operation is only used to determine if a node will ACK or NACK in the prepare phase (more on this below).
*   `nodeBehaviors`: A map where the key is node ID (integer) and the value is a list of strings representing node behavior.  If `operation` (from a particular transaction) is present in a node's `nodeBehaviors` list, that node will *always* return a NACK during the prepare phase for that transaction.  Otherwise, it will always return an ACK.

You need to simulate the execution of these transactions and return a `map[string]bool` indicating whether each transaction succeeded (committed) or failed (rolled back). The key of the map is the `ID` of the transaction, and the value is `true` if the transaction committed, and `false` if it rolled back.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `1 <= len(transactions) <= 100`
*   `0 <= nodeID < N` for all node IDs in `involvedNodes`
*   Node IDs in `involvedNodes` within a single transaction are unique.
*   The operations within transactions can be any string.
*   All transactions are independent and can be processed in any order.
*   Implement your simulator to be as efficient as possible. Avoid unnecessary data copying or excessive memory allocation.
*   The simulation must be deterministic. Given the same input, it should always produce the same output.

**Example:**

```go
N := 3
transactions := []Transaction{
    {ID: "T1", involvedNodes: []int{0, 1}, operation: "read"},
    {ID: "T2", involvedNodes: []int{1, 2}, operation: "write"},
    {ID: "T3", involvedNodes: []int{0, 2}, operation: "process"},
}
nodeBehaviors := map[int][]string{
    1: {"write"}, // Node 1 will always NACK transaction T2
    0: {"process"}, // Node 0 will always NACK transaction T3
}

result := SimulateTransactions(N, transactions, nodeBehaviors)
// Expected Result: map[string]bool{"T1": true, "T2": false, "T3": false}
```

**Data Structures:**

```go
type Transaction struct {
    ID            string
    involvedNodes []int
    operation     string
}
```
**Hints and Considerations:**

*   Think about how to represent the state of each node (e.g., locked/unlocked).
*   Consider using goroutines and channels to simulate the distributed nature of the system if you want an extra layer of complexity (optional, but could lead to more efficient solutions).  Be mindful of race conditions when using concurrency.
*   Focus on correctness first, then optimize for performance.  Large numbers of transactions could expose performance bottlenecks.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases and error handling (though explicit error handling isn't required in the function signature). For instance, how do you prevent the simulation from crashing when the input `nodeBehaviors` are invalid?

This problem combines algorithmic thinking with system design considerations, making it a challenging and rewarding exercise. Good luck!

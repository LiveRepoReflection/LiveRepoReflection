## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication in a Microservice Architecture

### Project Name

`microservice-router`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a high-performance inter-service communication router within a microservice architecture. The architecture consists of a large number of microservices (potentially thousands), each identified by a unique string-based service ID (e.g., "user-profile-service", "payment-processing", "recommendation-engine"). These services need to communicate with each other frequently.

**The Challenge:**

Direct service-to-service communication is undesirable due to increased complexity, discoverability issues, and potential cascading failures. Therefore, you need to implement a central router that acts as an intermediary.

The router receives requests, each containing:

*   `destination_service_id` (string): The ID of the target microservice.
*   `request_payload` ([]byte): The data to be sent to the target microservice.

The router must efficiently route the `request_payload` to the correct destination service. The key challenge lies in **optimizing routing performance** under the following constraints:

1.  **Service Discovery:** The router must dynamically discover the network addresses (e.g., IP address and port) of available instances of each service. Assume a separate service registry exists that provides this information. The service registry exposes a `GetServiceEndpoints(serviceID string) []string` function which returns a slice of network addresses for a given service ID. Each address in the slice represents a single instance of the service. The list may be empty if the service is currently unavailable.

    ```go
    // Assume this interface is provided by a separate service registry package
    type ServiceRegistry interface {
        GetServiceEndpoints(serviceID string) []string
    }
    ```

2.  **Load Balancing:** If multiple instances of a service are available, the router should distribute requests evenly across them. Implement a simple round-robin load balancing strategy.

3.  **Concurrency:** The router must handle a high volume of concurrent requests efficiently.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** If a service instance is unavailable (e.g., due to network issues or crashes), the router should detect this and automatically retry the request on a different instance of the same service, if available. You have a maximum of 3 retry attempts per request.

5.  **Timeout:** Each request should have a maximum timeout. If a service instance does not respond within the timeout, the router should consider it unavailable and retry on another instance (if available) or return an error. The timeout is configurable.

6.  **Limited Resources:** The router has limited memory and CPU resources. Minimize memory allocations and optimize for CPU usage.

7.  **Scalability:** The design should be scalable to handle a growing number of services and increasing request volumes.  Consider how your approach would scale horizontally (multiple router instances).

**Specific Requirements:**

*   Implement a `Router` struct with a `RouteRequest(destinationServiceID string, requestPayload []byte) ([]byte, error)` method.
*   Use goroutines and channels for concurrency.
*   Implement round-robin load balancing.
*   Implement retries with a configurable timeout.
*   Handle service discovery dynamically via the provided `ServiceRegistry` interface.
*   Optimize for performance and resource usage.
*   Consider thread safety.
*   Return appropriate error messages for failures (e.g., service unavailable, timeout).
*   Assume the existence of a function `sendRequest(endpoint string, payload []byte) ([]byte, error)` that handles the actual network communication to a service instance. This function is provided and you do not need to implement it. It abstracts the underlying network transport (e.g., gRPC, HTTP).

**Constraints:**

*   Minimize external dependencies.
*   Focus on correctness, performance, and scalability.
*   The `sendRequest` function is assumed to be potentially slow and unreliable.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated attempts to failing services.
*   Implement metrics collection (e.g., request latency, error rates) for monitoring.

This problem requires you to combine your knowledge of concurrency, data structures, algorithms, and system design principles to create a robust and efficient inter-service communication router. The emphasis is on handling a high volume of requests reliably and efficiently in a dynamic and potentially unreliable environment. Good luck!

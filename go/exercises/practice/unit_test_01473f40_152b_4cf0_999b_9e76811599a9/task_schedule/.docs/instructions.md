Okay, here's a coding problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated, suitable for a programming competition setting.

**Problem Title: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines**

**Problem Description:**

You are given a set of `N` tasks. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id[i]`: A unique integer identifier for the task (1 <= `id[i]` <= N).
*   `duration[i]`: The amount of time (in arbitrary units) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline[i]`:  A time by which the task must be completed to avoid a penalty.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task `id`s that must be completed before task `i` can start. Dependencies are represented as a list of integers, where each integer is the `id` of another task.

Your goal is to determine a schedule for completing the tasks that minimizes the total penalty incurred due to missed deadlines.

**Penalty Calculation:**

*   If a task is completed by its deadline, there is no penalty (penalty = 0).
*   If a task is completed after its deadline, the penalty is the amount of time by which the task completion time exceeds its deadline.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   `N`: The number of tasks (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   A list of `N` tuples, where each tuple represents a task: `(id[i], duration[i], deadline[i], dependencies[i])`.
    *   `id[i]` is an integer.
    *   `duration[i]` is an integer (1 <= `duration[i]` <= 100).
    *   `deadline[i]` is an integer (1 <= `deadline[i]` <= 10000).
    *   `dependencies[i]` is a list of integers representing the `id`s of the tasks that `task[i]` depends on. The dependency list can be empty.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The task IDs are unique and range from 1 to N.
*   Dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  There will be no circular dependencies.
*   It is possible that no schedule exists to complete all tasks before their deadlines. In such cases, the goal is to minimize the total penalty regardless.
*   The dependencies may specify tasks that do not exist. These should be considered invalid and ignored when scheduling.
*   Multiple tasks can be executed concurrently, provided that their dependencies are met.
*   Assume that there are unlimited resources for parallel task execution. Any number of tasks can be executed at the same time.
*   The tasks must be executed in their entirety; they cannot be preempted.

**Output:**

Your function should return a single integer representing the minimum total penalty achievable by any valid task schedule.

**Example:**

```
N = 3
tasks = [
    (1, 5, 10, []),  // Task 1: duration 5, deadline 10, no dependencies
    (2, 3, 15, [1]), // Task 2: duration 3, deadline 15, depends on task 1
    (3, 7, 20, [1,2])  // Task 3: duration 7, deadline 20, depends on tasks 1 and 2
]

Expected Output: 0
```

In this example, a schedule where task 1 is executed first, followed by task 2, and then task 3, will result in all tasks being completed before their deadlines.

**Judging Criteria:**

Solutions will be judged based on correctness (passing test cases) and efficiency (runtime performance).  Solutions that use inefficient algorithms may time out on larger test cases. The hidden test cases will include various scenarios that test the constraints and edge cases described above, including cases with many dependencies, tight deadlines, and tasks with long durations.

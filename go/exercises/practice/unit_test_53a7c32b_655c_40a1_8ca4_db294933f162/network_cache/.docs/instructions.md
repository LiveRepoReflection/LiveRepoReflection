Okay, here is a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and require efficient algorithms and data structures.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkPlacement`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing the core infrastructure for a new distributed database. The system consists of a set of `N` servers, each capable of storing data. The servers are interconnected via a network. The goal is to strategically place `K` "cache" nodes within this network to minimize the average latency experienced by data requests.

The network is represented as an undirected graph where:

*   Nodes in the graph represent servers. The nodes are labeled from `0` to `N-1`.
*   Edges represent network connections between servers. Each edge has a latency value associated with it (a non-negative integer).

You are given the following inputs:

*   `N`: The number of servers (nodes in the graph).
*   `K`: The number of cache nodes you can place ( `1 <= K <= N`).
*   `edges`: A list of edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(u, v, latency)`.  `u` and `v` are the server IDs (0-indexed), and `latency` is the latency of the connection between them.  The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   `requests`: A list of data request origins. Each element in `requests` is the server ID (0-indexed) where a data request originates.

A data request originating from server `s` is routed to the nearest cache node `c` (in terms of minimum total latency). If multiple cache nodes are equidistant from `s`, the request is routed to the cache node with the smallest ID. The latency experienced by the request is the total latency of the shortest path from `s` to `c`.

Your task is to write a function that determines the optimal placement of the `K` cache nodes among the `N` servers to minimize the *average* latency of all data requests. The function should return a list of the server IDs representing the optimal cache node placement. The server IDs in the returned list should be sorted in ascending order.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `1 <= K <= N`
*   `0 <= latency <= 100` for each edge.
*   The number of requests can be large (up to 10,000).
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   All server IDs in `edges` and `requests` are valid (i.e., within the range `[0, N-1]`).
*   Your solution must be efficient. A naive brute-force approach of trying all possible combinations of cache node placements will likely time out. Consider optimization techniques like dynamic programming or approximation algorithms.
*   There might be multiple optimal solutions (cache placements with the same minimal average latency). Your function should return one of them. The testing system will accept any of the optimal solutions.
*   Error tolerance: Due to floating-point precision, the testing system will accept solutions with average latency within a small tolerance (e.g., 1e-6) of the absolute optimal solution.

**Example:**

```go
N = 4
K = 1
edges = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [0, 3, 5]]
requests = [0, 1, 2, 3]

// One possible optimal solution is placing the cache at node 1 or 2.
// Placing cache at node 1:
// Latency(0 -> 1) = 1
// Latency(1 -> 1) = 0
// Latency(2 -> 1) = 1
// Latency(3 -> 1) = 2
// Average latency = (1 + 0 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 1.0

//Placing cache at node 2:
// Latency(0 -> 2) = 2
// Latency(1 -> 2) = 1
// Latency(2 -> 2) = 0
// Latency(3 -> 2) = 1
// Average latency = (2 + 1 + 0 + 1) / 4 = 1.0
//

// Placing cache at node 0:
// Latency(0 -> 0) = 0
// Latency(1 -> 0) = 1
// Latency(2 -> 0) = 2
// Latency(3 -> 0) = 5
// Average latency = (0 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 4 = 2.0

// Placing cache at node 3:
// Latency(0 -> 3) = 5
// Latency(1 -> 3) = 2
// Latency(2 -> 3) = 1
// Latency(3 -> 3) = 0
// Average latency = (5 + 2 + 1 + 0) / 4 = 2.0

// Expected output: [1] (or [2])
```

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms (shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall), careful consideration of data structures to efficiently store and retrieve shortest paths, and potentially some clever optimization strategies to avoid brute-force. Good luck!

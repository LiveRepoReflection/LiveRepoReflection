Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed with the elements you requested in mind:

## Project Name

`DistributedCache`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed, eventually consistent key-value cache system. This system must handle a high volume of read and write requests across multiple geographically distributed nodes.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Basic Cache Operations:** Implement `Get(key string) (string, bool)` and `Put(key string, value string)` functions. `Get` should return the value associated with the key and a boolean indicating whether the key exists. `Put` should store the key-value pair in the cache.

2.  **Distributed Architecture:** Assume the existence of a cluster of `N` nodes (where `N` can be large), each running an instance of your cache. You don't need to *implement* the node discovery/membership protocol, but your design *must* account for new nodes joining the cluster and existing nodes leaving (either gracefully or due to failure). Your cache should automatically adapt to changes in cluster membership.  Assume you have access to a function `GetNodeList() []string` that returns a current list of node addresses.

3.  **Data Partitioning (Sharding):**  Implement a consistent hashing scheme to distribute keys across the `N` nodes.  The goal is to minimize data movement when nodes are added or removed.  You can use any consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., Jump Hash, Rendezvous Hashing, or a simple modulo-based approach with a virtual node strategy).  Justify your choice of algorithm and discuss its tradeoffs.

4.  **Eventual Consistency:**  Writes should be propagated to other nodes asynchronously. Implement a mechanism to handle write conflicts.  Consider using vector clocks or Lamport timestamps to resolve conflicts in a last-write-wins (LWW) fashion. Explain your choice and how you handle potential clock drift issues (if applicable). Note: The problem is focused on eventual consistency within a single data center.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** Handle node failures gracefully. If a node is unavailable during a `Get` operation, the system should attempt to retrieve the data from other replicas.  Implement a configurable replication factor `R` (where `R <= N`).  Each key should be replicated across `R` nodes.

6.  **Concurrency:** Ensure your cache implementation is thread-safe and can handle concurrent `Get` and `Put` requests efficiently. Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

7.  **Optimization:** Focus on minimizing latency for `Get` operations. Consider caching frequently accessed data locally on each node. Think about read-repair strategy to improve consistency. Also, consider the performance implications of your choice of serialization format for data replication.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Data Size:** Assume that both keys and values can be relatively large strings (up to 1MB).
*   **Network Latency:**  Nodes can experience variable network latency. Your system should be resilient to temporary network disruptions.
*   **Node Failures:** Nodes can fail unpredictably. Your system should continue to function even if a significant portion of nodes are unavailable.
*   **Number of Nodes:** The number of nodes in the cluster can vary significantly over time (from a few nodes to hundreds or even thousands).
*   **Conflicting Writes:**  Handle the scenario where multiple nodes receive conflicting writes for the same key concurrently.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   **Read Repair:** Implement a read repair mechanism to ensure that data is eventually consistent across all replicas.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement a mechanism for invalidating cached data (e.g., using a TTL or a versioning scheme).
*   **Metrics and Monitoring:**  Expose metrics (e.g., cache hit rate, latency, error rate) to facilitate monitoring and debugging.
*   **Data Eviction:** Implement a data eviction policy (e.g., LRU or LFU) to prevent the cache from growing indefinitely.
*   **Inter-region Replication:** Consider eventual consistency between different geographical regions.

This problem requires you to make several design choices and justify them based on the specific requirements and constraints.  The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of distributed systems principles, data structures, concurrency, and fault tolerance.  A clean, well-documented, and efficient implementation will be highly valued.

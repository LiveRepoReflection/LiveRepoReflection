Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Go coding problem:

**Project Name:** `NetworkPathfinder`

**Question Description:**

You are given a representation of a computer network. The network consists of `n` computers, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. The network connections are represented by a list of bidirectional cables. Each cable connects two computers and has a certain latency associated with it.

Specifically, you are given:

*   `n` (integer): The number of computers in the network.
*   `cables` (`[][]int`): A list of cables, where each cable is represented as `[computer1, computer2, latency]`. `computer1` and `computer2` are the IDs of the two computers connected by the cable, and `latency` is the latency of the cable.
*   `queries` (`[][]int`): A list of queries. Each query is represented as `[source, destination, max_cables, allowed_latency]`. `source` and `destination` are the IDs of the source and destination computers for the query. `max_cables` represents the maximum number of cables that can be traversed in a path. `allowed_latency` represents the maximum allowed latency along the path.

Your task is to write a function `findPaths` that takes `n`, `cables`, and `queries` as input and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of *distinct* paths (without cycles) that satisfy the conditions in the corresponding query.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= cables.length <= 5000`
*   `cables[i].length == 3`
*   `0 <= cables[i][0], cables[i][1] < n`
*   `1 <= cables[i][2] <= 100` (latency)
*   `0 <= queries.length <= 100`
*   `queries[i].length == 4`
*   `0 <= queries[i][0], queries[i][1] < n`
*   `1 <= queries[i][2] <= 10` (max_cables)
*   `1 <= queries[i][3] <= 1000` (allowed_latency)
*   The graph represented by the cables is undirected and may not be fully connected.
*   A path may only contain each node at most once (no cycles).
*   For a given query, it is possible that the source and destination are the same node. In this case, the only valid path is the one with 0 cables and 0 latency.

**Example:**

```go
n := 5
cables := [][]int{{0, 1, 5}, {0, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 1}}
queries := [][]int{{0, 3, 2, 10}, {0, 4, 3, 12}}

result := findPaths(n, cables, queries) // Expected output: [2, 2]

// Explanation for the first query [0, 3, 2, 10]:
// Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 3 (latency 5 + 2 = 7, cables = 2)
// Path 2: 0 -> 2 -> 3 (latency 3 + 4 = 7, cables = 2)

// Explanation for the second query [0, 4, 3, 12]:
// Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (latency 5 + 2 + 1 = 8, cables = 3)
// Path 2: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (latency 3 + 4 + 1 = 8, cables = 3)
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, careful state management to avoid cycles, and optimization to efficiently handle the constraints. It's likely to require a modified Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm with pruning to avoid exploring paths that exceed the `max_cables` or `allowed_latency` limits. Be careful to correctly handle the edge cases, such as disconnected graphs and the possibility of the source and destination being the same. The "distinct paths" requirement adds another layer of complexity, as the same computer cannot be visited multiple times.

Good luck!

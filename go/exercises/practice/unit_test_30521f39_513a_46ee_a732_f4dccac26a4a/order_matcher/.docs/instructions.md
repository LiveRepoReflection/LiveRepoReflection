Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging and require careful consideration of efficiency, data structures, and edge cases:

## Question: Decentralized Order Matching System

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a core component of a decentralized order matching system for a new cryptocurrency exchange.  This exchange allows users to place limit orders to buy or sell tokens. Your component is responsible for efficiently matching buy and sell orders based on price and time priority.

**Core Functionality:**

Implement a function `MatchOrders` that takes two lists as input: a list of buy orders and a list of sell orders.  The function should return a list of "trades" that represent the successful matches between buy and sell orders.

**Data Structures:**

You will be working with the following data structures:

```go
type Order struct {
	OrderID   string
	OrderType string // "BUY" or "SELL"
	Price     int    // Price per token
	Quantity  int    // Number of tokens
	Timestamp int64  // Unix timestamp of order placement (nanoseconds)
	UserID    string  // Unique identifier for the user who placed the order
}

type Trade struct {
	BuyOrderID  string
	SellOrderID string
	Price       int
	Quantity    int
}
```

**Matching Logic:**

1.  **Price Priority:**  Buy orders should be matched with the lowest possible sell price, and sell orders should be matched with the highest possible buy price.
2.  **Time Priority (FIFO):**  Within the same price level, orders should be matched in the order they were placed (First-In, First-Out).
3.  **Partial Fills:** If a buy order's quantity is greater than a sell order's quantity, the sell order is completely filled, and the remaining quantity of the buy order should be used to match with other sell orders (and vice-versa).
4.  **No Self-Trades:**  A user cannot trade with themself. Do not create trades where the BuyOrderID and SellOrderID belong to the same UserID. If a trade is possible based on price and time priority, but the UserID is the same, then skip this order and proceed to the next matching order.

**Input:**

*   `buyOrders`: A slice of `Order` structs representing buy orders.
*   `sellOrders`: A slice of `Order` structs representing sell orders.

**Output:**

*   A slice of `Trade` structs representing the trades that occurred. The trades should be ordered based on the timestamp of the *buy* order in the trade.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Performance:** The `MatchOrders` function must be highly performant.  The exchange expects to handle a large volume of orders with minimal latency. Consider the time complexity of your solution.
*   **Concurrency:**  Assume the `MatchOrders` function will be called concurrently from multiple goroutines.  Ensure your solution is thread-safe.  However, *do not* use channels or goroutines within the `MatchOrders` function itself. All synchronization must be handled with mutexes or similar primitives.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle the following edge cases:
    *   Empty input lists.
    *   Buy/Sell orders with zero quantity.
    *   Orders with negative prices or quantities (treat as invalid and ignore them; do not throw errors).
    *   Orders with duplicate OrderIDs. The behavior in case of duplicates is undefined, so you are free to handle it as you wish (e.g. overwrite, ignore, etc.)
*   **Token Integer Arithmetic:** Assume all tokens are whole numbers with no fractional parts and only support integer arithmetic.

**Example:**

```go
buyOrders := []Order{
	{"buy1", "BUY", 10, 5, 1678886400000000000, "user1"},
	{"buy2", "BUY", 10, 3, 1678886401000000000, "user2"},
	{"buy3", "BUY", 9, 2, 1678886402000000000, "user3"},
}

sellOrders := []Order{
	{"sell1", "SELL", 9, 4, 1678886399000000000, "user4"},
	{"sell2", "SELL", 10, 2, 1678886403000000000, "user5"},
}

trades := MatchOrders(buyOrders, sellOrders)

// Expected trades (order may vary depending on implementation details):
// [
//  {BuyOrderID: "buy1", SellOrderID: "sell1", Price: 9, Quantity: 4},
//  {BuyOrderID: "buy1", SellOrderID: "sell2", Price: 10, Quantity: 1},
//  {BuyOrderID: "buy2", SellOrderID: "sell2", Price: 10, Quantity: 2},
//  {BuyOrderID: "buy3", SellOrderID: "sell2", Price: 10, Quantity: 1},
//  {BuyOrderID: "buy3", SellOrderID: "sell1", Price: 9, Quantity: 1},
// ]
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the matching logic.
*   Efficiency of the solution (time complexity).
*   Thread-safety and proper use of synchronization mechanisms.
*   Handling of edge cases.
*   Code clarity and readability.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and attention to detail.  Good luck!

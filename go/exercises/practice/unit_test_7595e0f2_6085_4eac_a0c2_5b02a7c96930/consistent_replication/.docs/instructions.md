Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, aiming for a LeetCode Hard level:

**Project Name:** `ConsistentReplication`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a distributed, eventually consistent key-value store with strong ordering guarantees within each key.  The system consists of `n` nodes (where `n` can be a large number, potentially in the thousands), and clients that can connect to any node to read or write data.

**Data Model:**

*   The key-value store supports only string keys and string values.
*   Each key maintains a version history represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Each node in the DAG represents a version of the value for that key.
*   Edges in the DAG represent causal relationships (i.e., one version was derived from another).
*   A client can read the "latest" version of a key, which is defined as any version that is a leaf node in the DAG.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Data Structure:** Implement the necessary data structures to represent the version history (DAG) for each key. Your data structure needs to efficiently handle a large number of versions and causal relationships. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and read/write performance.

2.  **Write Operation:** Implement the `Write(key string, value string, parents []string)` function.  This function creates a new version of the value for the given `key`.  `parents` is a slice of strings representing the version IDs of the parent versions from which this new version is derived.  If `parents` is empty, this is the initial version. The `Write` operation must ensure that the DAG remains acyclic.  The new version should be persisted (simulated persistence is acceptable for this problem). You must assign a unique version ID to each version.

3.  **Read Operation:** Implement the `Read(key string)` function.  This function returns *a* "latest" version (a leaf node in the DAG) of the value for the given `key`. If the key does not exist, return an appropriate error. If multiple "latest" versions exist, you can return any of them.  Optimize for read performance.

4.  **Consistency:** Guarantee causal consistency. If version B was derived from version A (A is a parent of B), then a read operation will never return version A before version B. In other words, all dependencies of a version must be visible to the client before the version itself becomes visible.  Implement a mechanism to ensure this causal consistency.

5.  **Concurrency:**  Handle concurrent read and write operations from multiple clients across the distributed system. Use appropriate locking mechanisms (or other concurrency control techniques) to ensure data integrity and prevent race conditions.

6.  **Efficiency:** Optimize for both read and write performance, considering the potential for a large number of concurrent operations and a large number of versions per key.  Consider data locality and caching strategies. Think about how to avoid unnecessary serialization/deserialization.

7.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Writing to a non-existent key (should create a new DAG).
    *   Writing with invalid parent version IDs (should return an error).
    *   Reading a key that has no versions (should return an error).
    *   Handling cycles in the DAG (should prevent them).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the system (`n`) can be large (up to thousands).
*   The number of versions per key can be very large.
*   Read and write operations can occur concurrently from multiple clients.
*   You do *not* need to implement actual network communication or distributed consensus. You can simulate the distributed environment in a single process.
*   Assume sufficient memory for storing a reasonable number of versions, but optimize for memory usage where possible.

**Bonus (optional):**

*   Implement a mechanism for garbage collecting old versions of a key, while still preserving the causal history.
*   Implement a mechanism to detect and resolve conflicts between concurrent writes to the same key.  Consider using vector clocks or similar techniques.
*   Design a system that tolerates node failures.

This problem combines data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design considerations to create a challenging and sophisticated programming task suitable for experienced Go programmers. Good luck!

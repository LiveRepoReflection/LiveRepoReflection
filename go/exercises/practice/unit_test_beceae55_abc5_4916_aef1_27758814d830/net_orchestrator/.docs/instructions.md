### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a network orchestrator service. This service manages a virtual network topology consisting of virtual machines (VMs) and virtual network links connecting them. The orchestrator must efficiently handle dynamic changes to the network, including adding/removing VMs, adding/removing network links, and updating link bandwidth capacities.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Topology Representation:** The network topology should be represented using a graph data structure. Each node in the graph represents a VM, and each edge represents a network link between VMs.

2.  **VM Management:** Implement the following functionalities:
    *   `AddVM(vmID string)`: Adds a new VM to the network with the given unique ID.
    *   `RemoveVM(vmID string)`: Removes the VM with the given ID from the network. Removing a VM also removes all network links associated with it.

3.  **Network Link Management:** Implement the following functionalities:
    *   `AddLink(vmID1 string, vmID2 string, bandwidth int)`: Adds a network link between VM `vmID1` and VM `vmID2` with the specified bandwidth. The link is bidirectional and undirected. If a link already exists between the two VMs, update the bandwidth to the new value.
    *   `RemoveLink(vmID1 string, vmID2 string)`: Removes the network link between VM `vmID1` and VM `vmID2`.
    *   `UpdateLinkBandwidth(vmID1 string, vmID2 string, newBandwidth int)`: Updates the bandwidth of the existing link between VM `vmID1` and `vmID2` to `newBandwidth`.  Return an error if the link doesn't exist.

4.  **Pathfinding:** Implement a function to find the maximum bandwidth path between two VMs:
    *   `FindMaxBandwidthPath(vmID1 string, vmID2 string) []string`: Finds a path between `vmID1` and `vmID2` that maximizes the minimum bandwidth along the path. The function should return a list of VM IDs representing the path, including the start and end VMs. If no path exists, return an empty list.  If multiple paths have the same maximum bandwidth, return any one of them.

5.  **Scalability and Performance:** The orchestrator must be able to handle a large number of VMs (up to 10,000) and network links. The pathfinding algorithm should be optimized for performance. Aim for average case time complexity better than naive implementations (e.g., avoid repeatedly traversing the entire graph).

6.  **Concurrency:** The orchestrator service should be thread-safe. Multiple concurrent requests to add/remove VMs/links should be handled correctly without data races.

7.  **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling. Return meaningful error messages when invalid operations are attempted (e.g., removing a non-existent VM, adding a link to a non-existent VM).

**Constraints:**

*   VM IDs are unique strings.
*   Bandwidth is a positive integer.
*   The number of VMs can be up to 10,000.
*   The number of network links can be up to 50,000.
*   Pathfinding should be reasonably fast, even on large networks.

**Considerations:**

*   Choose appropriate data structures for efficient graph representation and operations.
*   Consider using concurrency primitives (e.g., mutexes, read-write locks) to ensure thread safety.
*   Think about different pathfinding algorithms and their trade-offs (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, modified BFS, binary search).  The most efficient algorithm is not always the most straightforward to implement.
*   Consider the space complexity of your data structures.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, concurrency, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to create a truly challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

`DistributedConsistentCounter`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed, eventually consistent counter service. This service will be deployed across multiple nodes in a cluster and must handle concurrent increment and read requests from various clients.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Increment API:** Provide an `Increment()` method that allows clients to increment the counter. The increment requests can be sent to any node in the cluster.

2.  **Read API:** Provide a `Read()` method that allows clients to read the current approximate value of the counter. The read requests can be sent to any node in the cluster.

3.  **Eventual Consistency:** The system does *not* need to provide strong consistency. Reads may not reflect the most recent increments. However, the system should eventually converge to the correct count, assuming no further increments are made.

4.  **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a suitable conflict resolution strategy for concurrent increments. Consider approaches like Last-Write-Wins (LWW), Vector Clocks, or other suitable techniques to reconcile conflicting counter values across different nodes.

5.  **Node Discovery:** Implement a mechanism for nodes to discover each other and exchange counter state. Assume a simple environment where nodes can determine the other peers using a configuration file.

6.  **Scalability:** Your design should be scalable to handle a large number of nodes and a high volume of requests.

7.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should tolerate node failures. If a node goes down, the remaining nodes should continue to operate, and the system should eventually recover the lost increments when the node rejoins the cluster.

8.  **Optimization:** Optimize your implementation for read performance. It is acceptable to trade off some increment performance for faster reads, given that reads are expected to be more frequent.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Network Partitioning:** You do not need to handle network partitioning scenarios (split-brain).
*   **Data Loss:** Minimize the risk of data loss during node failures.
*   **Clock Synchronization:** Assume there is no perfectly synchronized clock across all nodes.
*   **Performance:** The system should be able to handle a reasonable throughput of increment and read requests.
*   **External Dependencies:** Minimize external dependencies. Using the standard library as much as possible is encouraged.
*   **Communication:** You can use any suitable inter-node communication mechanism (e.g., gRPC, HTTP, or even simple TCP sockets).

**Expected Implementation:**

Your solution should include:

*   A `Node` struct representing a node in the cluster.
*   Methods for handling increment and read requests.
*   A mechanism for inter-node communication and state synchronization.
*   A conflict resolution strategy for reconciling counter values.
*   A clear explanation of the chosen conflict resolution strategy and its trade-offs.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the system eventually converge to the correct count?
*   Scalability: Does the design scale well with the number of nodes?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does the system tolerate node failures?
*   Read Performance: How quickly can the system handle read requests?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Design Choices: Are the design choices well-justified and appropriate for the problem?
*   Handling of Edge Cases: How many edge cases are handled gracefully.

This problem challenges the solver to design a real-world distributed system, requiring a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems principles. The open-ended nature of the problem allows for multiple valid solutions, each with its own trade-offs. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging for experienced Go programmers, incorporating several of the elements you requested:

### Project Name

```
Distributed Consensus Log
```

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified version of a distributed consensus log using the Raft consensus algorithm principles. Imagine a cluster of servers that need to agree on a sequence of events (the log). This problem focuses on the log replication aspect of Raft.

**Scenario:**

You have a cluster of `N` servers, where `N` is an odd number (e.g., 3, 5, 7). Each server maintains its own log, which is a sequence of entries. An entry consists of a `term` (an integer representing a leader election cycle) and a `data` payload (a string).

One server is elected as the leader. The leader is responsible for receiving client requests, appending them to its log as new entries, and replicating these entries to the other servers (followers).

**Your Task:**

Implement a function that simulates the log replication process. The function will receive the leader's log and the logs of several followers. It needs to determine which entries from the leader's log should be sent to each follower to bring their logs up-to-date. Specifically, you need to implement the logic for determining the correct starting point for replication for each follower.

**Input:**

*   `leaderLog`: A slice of log entries. Each entry has a `term` (int) and `data` (string).
*   `followerLogs`: A slice of slices of log entries. Each inner slice represents the log of one follower.
*   `lastApplied`: A slice of integers, represents the index of the last applied entry of each follower.
*   `commitIndex`: An integer, represents the leader's commit index. Entry at or before the commitIndex are considered committed in the cluster.

**Output:**

A slice of structs, one for each follower. Each struct should contain:

*   `startIndex`: The index in the leader's log from which the follower should start receiving entries (inclusive). This is the index of the first new entry for the follower.
*   `entries`: A slice of log entries representing the new entries to be sent to the follower, starting from `startIndex`.
*   `success`: A boolean indicating whether the replication attempt was considered successful in terms of log matching.
*   `leaderCommit`: An integer, represents the leader's commit index.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

1.  **Log Matching:** The core of the algorithm is log matching. The leader needs to find an entry in the follower's log that matches an entry in its own log (same term and index). If no match is found, the leader must decrement the next index until a match is found or the follower log is empty. You *cannot* simply append the leader's log to the follower's log.
2.  **Term Numbers:** Term numbers are crucial for safety. If a follower has an entry with a different term number than the leader at the same index, it indicates a conflict that needs to be resolved.
3.  **Empty Logs:** Handle the case where the leader's or a follower's log is empty.
4.  **Log Gaps:** The follower log might have gaps (e.g., due to previous failures). You *must* handle this case gracefully, meaning you should not assume follower log is always contiguous.
5.  **Conflicting Logs:** If the follower's log contains entries that conflict with the leader's log (same index, different term), the follower's conflicting entries should be overwritten by the leader's entries. You are *not* implementing the actual overwriting logic, but you *must* determine the correct entries that *would* overwrite the follower's log.
6.  **Commit Index:** The `commitIndex` is the highest log entry known to be committed. The leader sends its `commitIndex` to the followers, so followers can update their own `commitIndex`. You should send the leader's current `commitIndex` to the followers.
7.  **Optimization:** While correctness is paramount, try to minimize the number of log entries sent to each follower.
8. **lastApplied consistency:**  The `lastApplied` of each follower cannot be greater than the length of the follower's log. If that's the case, it means the `lastApplied` is corrupted and should be considered to be equivalent to the length of the follower's log.

**Struct Definitions (for clarity):**

```go
type LogEntry struct {
    Term int
    Data string
}

type ReplicationResult struct {
    StartIndex int
    Entries []LogEntry
    Success bool
    LeaderCommit int
}
```

**Function Signature:**

```go
func ReplicateLogs(leaderLog []LogEntry, followerLogs [][]LogEntry, lastApplied []int, commitIndex int) []ReplicationResult
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The replication process must adhere to the Raft log matching rules and handle conflicts correctly.
*   Edge Cases: All constraints and edge cases must be handled gracefully.
*   Efficiency: The solution should avoid unnecessary data transfer.
*   Code Clarity: The code should be well-structured and easy to understand.

This problem requires a solid understanding of the Raft consensus algorithm, careful attention to detail, and efficient implementation techniques. Good luck!

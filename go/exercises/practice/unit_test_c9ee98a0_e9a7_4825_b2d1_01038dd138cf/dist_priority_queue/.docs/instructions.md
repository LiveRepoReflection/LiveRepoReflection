Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Go coding problem. Here's the problem description:

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed priority queue system. This system should allow multiple producer clients to submit tasks with associated priorities, and multiple worker clients to retrieve and execute these tasks in priority order. The system needs to be highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Task Definition:** A task consists of a unique ID (string), a priority (integer, lower value indicates higher priority), and a payload (string).

2.  **API:** Implement two primary RPC endpoints:
    *   `SubmitTask(task)`: Allows a producer client to submit a new task to the queue.
    *   `RetrieveTask()`: Allows a worker client to retrieve the highest-priority task from the queue. If the queue is empty, the worker should block until a task becomes available or a timeout occurs (see below).

3.  **Distributed Architecture:** The priority queue should be distributed across multiple server nodes for scalability and fault tolerance. You must implement a consistent hashing scheme to distribute tasks across these nodes.

4.  **High Availability:** Ensure that the system remains available even if some server nodes fail. Implement data replication across multiple nodes.  The replication factor should be configurable.

5.  **Persistence:**  Tasks should be persisted to disk to survive server restarts.

6.  **Priority Ordering:** Tasks must be retrieved by workers in strict priority order.  Ensure consistency across the distributed system.

7.  **Concurrency:**  Handle concurrent requests from multiple producers and workers efficiently.

8.  **Timeout:** The `RetrieveTask()` call should have a configurable timeout. If no task becomes available within the timeout period, the worker should receive a "no task available" response.  The timeout should be handled at the server side, not the client side.

9.  **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):** If a worker fails to process a task (simulated by the worker returning an error to the server after retrieval), the task should be moved to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).  Tasks in the DLQ should not be retried automatically. A separate, out-of-band process (not part of this problem) would be responsible for analyzing and potentially re-enqueuing tasks from the DLQ.

10. **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of tasks and clients.  Consider strategies for horizontal scaling.

**Constraints:**

*   **Data Consistency:**  Maintain strong consistency for task ordering and availability.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should tolerate the failure of some server nodes without data loss or service interruption.
*   **Performance:**  Minimize latency for task submission and retrieval.  The system should be able to handle a high throughput of requests.
*   **Resource Usage:** Use resources (CPU, memory, disk) efficiently.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   **Concurrency Safety:** Your code must be concurrency-safe.
*   **Avoid External Libraries:** Minimize reliance on external libraries where possible.  Focus on implementing the core logic yourself.  Using standard library packages is allowed.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement task expiration.  Tasks older than a certain age should be automatically moved to an archive.
*   Implement task prioritization based on multiple criteria (e.g., priority, submission time).
*   Implement monitoring and metrics collection.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, data structures, and Go programming. It's designed to be a challenging and comprehensive test of a candidate's skills. Good luck!

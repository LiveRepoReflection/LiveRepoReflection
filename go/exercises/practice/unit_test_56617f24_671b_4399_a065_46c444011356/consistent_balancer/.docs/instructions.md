Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description.

**Project Name:** `ConsistentHashingLoadBalancer`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly scalable and fault-tolerant load balancer using consistent hashing. The system will distribute incoming requests across a cluster of backend servers.

**Functionality:**

The load balancer should:

1.  **Register/Unregister Backend Servers:**  Allow backend servers to dynamically join and leave the cluster. Each server is identified by a unique string ID (e.g., "server-1", "server-2").

2.  **Distribute Requests:** Given a request identified by a unique key (string), the load balancer must consistently map the key to one of the currently registered backend servers.  Consistent hashing ensures that when servers are added or removed, only a minimal number of keys are remapped.

3.  **Handle Server Failures:** Gracefully handle server failures. If a server goes down, requests that were previously mapped to that server should be automatically remapped to other available servers. This remapping should be as minimal as possible to avoid cascading failures.

4.  **Uniform Distribution:** Ensure that the requests are distributed as uniformly as possible across the available servers. Implement a mechanism to mitigate hotspots (servers receiving a disproportionately high number of requests). You must address the "uneven distribution problem" that can occur with naive consistent hashing. Consider implementing a technique like "virtual nodes" (also known as "vnodes" or "replicas").

5.  **Provide Server Status:**  Expose an API endpoint to query the status of each server (e.g., "online", "offline").

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The load balancer must be able to handle a large number of backend servers (e.g., thousands) and a high volume of requests (e.g., millions per second).
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to server failures. The load balancer itself should be designed to be highly available (though you don't need to implement full redundancy, focus on how data structures allow for simple replication).
*   **Efficiency:** The mapping of keys to servers must be performed efficiently (ideally in O(log N) time, where N is the number of virtual nodes or servers, depending on the chosen implementation).
*   **Data Structures:** You are strongly encouraged to use appropriate data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of server information and consistent hashing rings (e.g., a sorted map or a balanced tree).
*   **Concurrency:** The load balancer must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests efficiently. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels) to avoid race conditions.
*   **Hashing Function:** Use a robust and well-distributed hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to map keys and server IDs to the hashing ring. You don't need to implement the hashing algorithm itself, you can use a library.
*   **Virtual Nodes:** Implement virtual nodes to improve the distribution of requests across the servers.  The number of virtual nodes per server should be configurable.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and logging.

**Input/Output:**

The problem does not specify file input/output. Focus on implementing the core logic of the load balancer. You should, however, design an API (Go functions/methods) for:

*   Registering a server: `RegisterServer(serverID string)`
*   Unregistering a server: `UnregisterServer(serverID string)`
*   Mapping a request key to a server: `GetServerForKey(key string) string` (returns the server ID)
*   Getting the status of a server: `GetServerStatus(serverID string) string` (returns "online" or "offline")

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The load balancer must correctly map keys to servers and handle server failures.
*   Efficiency: The mapping of keys to servers must be performed efficiently.
*   Uniformity: The requests must be distributed as uniformly as possible across the servers.
*   Scalability: The load balancer must be able to handle a large number of servers and requests.
*   Fault Tolerance: The system must be resilient to server failures.
*   Code Quality: The code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Error Handling: The code must handle errors gracefully.

This problem requires a good understanding of consistent hashing, data structures, concurrency, and system design principles. It encourages the solver to think about real-world challenges in distributed systems. Good luck!

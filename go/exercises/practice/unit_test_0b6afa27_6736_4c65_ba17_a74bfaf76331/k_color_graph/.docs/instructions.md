Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Go coding problem.

### Project Name

```
k-Coloring-Graph
```

### Question Description

Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list and an integer `k`, determine if the graph is k-colorable. A graph is k-colorable if each node can be assigned one of `k` colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the graph, labeled from 0 to n-1.
*   `edges`: A list of edges, where each edge is a tuple `(u, v)` representing an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
*   `k`: The number of available colors, labeled from 1 to k.

**Output:**

*   Return `true` if the graph is k-colorable, and `false` otherwise.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= n * (n - 1) / 2` (No duplicate edges)
*   `1 <= k <= n`
*   The graph may not be connected.
*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle graphs with high degree vertices and large numbers of edges. Consider the time complexity for practical graphs. Aim for an algorithm better than brute-force.
*   The graph can contain self-loops. Your solution should correctly handle these situations.
*   Your solution should correctly handle empty graphs (no nodes and no edges). An empty graph is considered k-colorable.
*   The goal is to determine *if* a solution *exists* and not find *all* possible solutions. Focus on efficient decision-making, rather than enumerating all colorings.
*   If k = 1, your code needs to verify that there are no edges.

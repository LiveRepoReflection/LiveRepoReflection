## Question: Distributed Transaction Orchestrator

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction orchestrator. This orchestrator manages transactions that span multiple independent services. Due to network latency and potential service failures, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties becomes a significant challenge.

Your orchestrator should support the Saga pattern, a common approach for managing distributed transactions. The Saga pattern breaks a large transaction into a sequence of smaller, local transactions (Saga steps). Each Saga step updates data within a single service. If a Saga step fails, the orchestrator executes compensating transactions (rollback steps) to undo the effects of the preceding successful steps, ensuring eventual consistency.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Transaction Definition:** A transaction is defined as a sequence of operations (Saga steps). Each Saga step consists of two functions: a `commit` function and a `rollback` function. The `commit` function performs the actual operation on a service, and the `rollback` function undoes the changes made by the `commit` function.

    *   Assume that each `commit` function and `rollback` function is idempotent, meaning that executing the same function multiple times has the same effect as executing it once. This is crucial for handling retries in a distributed environment.
    *   Assume that each `commit` function and `rollback` function returns an error upon failure.

2.  **Orchestrator Implementation:** Your orchestrator must execute the Saga steps in order. If a `commit` function fails, the orchestrator must execute the `rollback` functions for all previously successfully committed Saga steps in reverse order. If a `rollback` fails, the orchestrator must retry the `rollback` function indefinitely (with a backoff strategy) until it succeeds. This ensures that all previously committed steps are eventually rolled back, even in the face of persistent failures.

3.  **Concurrency and Ordering:**  The orchestrator must handle concurrent transaction requests. Transactions must be executed serially within the orchestrator to avoid race conditions and ensure consistency. This means that only one transaction can be in progress at any given time.

4.  **Error Handling:** The orchestrator must handle errors gracefully. If a `commit` function fails, the orchestrator must initiate the rollback process. If a `rollback` function fails, the orchestrator must retry the `rollback` function until it succeeds.  The orchestrator should log all errors and retry attempts.

5.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism. If any `commit` or `rollback` function exceeds a specified timeout, consider it a failure and initiate the rollback process (for `commit` failure) or continue retrying (for `rollback` failure).

6.  **Input:** The input to the orchestrator is a list of Saga steps. Each Saga step is a struct containing the `commit` and `rollback` functions, along with a timeout duration.

7.  **Output:** The orchestrator should return an error if the transaction fails (either during the commit or rollback phase). If the transaction completes successfully, it should return `nil`.  The orchestrator should also provide detailed logging of its operations.

**Constraints:**

*   **Real-World Simulation:** Simulate service failures using random number generation.  Introduce a small probability (e.g., 5%) that any `commit` or `rollback` function will fail.
*   **Limited Resources:** The orchestrator has limited memory and CPU resources. Optimize your implementation to minimize memory usage and CPU overhead.
*   **Scalability:** While the orchestrator only needs to handle serial execution of transactions, design your code with scalability in mind. Consider how you would adapt your design to support concurrent transaction execution if the single process bottleneck were removed (e.g., using distributed locking).
*   **Idempotency:** Your implementation must ensure the idempotency of `commit` and `rollback` functions is maintained throughout the process, especially during retries.
*   **Optimizations:** Optimize for speed, minimize unnecessary operations, and design efficient retry strategies.

**Considerations:**

*   **Locking Mechanisms:** How will you ensure only one transaction is running at a time? Consider using mutexes or channels for synchronization.
*   **Retry Strategies:** What backoff strategy will you use for retrying failed `rollback` functions? Consider exponential backoff.
*   **Logging:** How will you log the progress of the transaction and any errors that occur? Consider using a structured logging format.
*   **Testing:** How will you test your orchestrator to ensure that it correctly handles failures and retries? Consider using integration tests to simulate real-world scenarios.
*   **Code Structure:** Design your code in a modular and maintainable way. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to ensure efficiency.

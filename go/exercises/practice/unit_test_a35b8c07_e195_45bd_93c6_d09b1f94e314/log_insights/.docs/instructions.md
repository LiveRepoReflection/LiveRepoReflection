## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed log analysis system. Imagine a large-scale distributed system generating massive amounts of log data across numerous nodes. Your system needs to efficiently analyze these logs to identify potential issues, anomalies, and trends.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **Log Aggregation:** Simulate a scenario where log entries are generated by multiple worker nodes and sent to a central aggregator. Each log entry consists of a timestamp (Unix epoch in nanoseconds), a node ID (string), a log level (enum: `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`), and a message (string). You should implement a mechanism to receive and store these log entries efficiently.  Assume there are potentially millions of worker nodes.

2.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** Implement an anomaly detection algorithm that identifies unusual patterns in the log data.  Specifically, detect if the number of `ERROR` logs originating from a single node exceeds a threshold within a sliding time window. The threshold and window size (in nanoseconds) are configurable. You should consider using a data structure that allows for efficient querying of log counts within a time range.

3.  **Complex Querying:** Support querying the aggregated logs based on various criteria, including:

    *   Time range (start and end timestamps).
    *   Node ID(s) (can be a single ID or a list of IDs).
    *   Log level(s) (can be a single level or a list of levels).
    *   Keyword search within the log message.

    The query should return a sorted list of log entries matching the criteria, sorted by timestamp in ascending order.

4.  **Scalability and Efficiency:**  Your solution must be designed to handle a high volume of log data and a large number of concurrent queries. Pay close attention to memory usage and processing time. You are expected to handle a potentially unbounded stream of logs.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The system must be able to handle concurrent log ingestion and queries.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** Minimize memory usage, especially considering the potentially massive scale of the log data.  Disk-based storage or other memory-saving techniques might be necessary.
*   **Time Complexity:** Queries should be optimized for speed. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize query latency.
*   **Configurability:** The anomaly detection threshold and window size should be configurable.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
*   **Simulate Log Generation:** You will need to simulate the generation of log entries from multiple worker nodes to test your system.
*   **No External Databases:** You are restricted from using external database systems (SQL or NoSQL) for data storage. You must implement the storage and querying mechanisms yourself. You can use standard Go libraries for data structures and algorithms.

**Bonus (Optional):**

*   Implement a persistent storage mechanism (e.g., storing logs to disk) to handle system restarts and prevent data loss.
*   Explore different anomaly detection algorithms and compare their performance in this context.
*   Implement distributed querying to further improve query performance across multiple nodes.

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Go coding problem:

**Problem Title:**  Scalable Geo-Distributed Key-Value Store

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly scalable and geo-distributed key-value store. This store must handle a massive number of read and write requests per second while maintaining strong consistency guarantees across geographically distributed data centers.

**Function Signature:**

```go
type KeyValueStore interface {
	// Get retrieves the value associated with the given key.
	// Returns the value and a boolean indicating if the key exists.
	// Returns an error if the operation fails (e.g., network issue).
	Get(key string) (string, bool, error)

	// Put stores the value associated with the given key.
	// Returns an error if the operation fails.
	Put(key, value string) error
}

// NewKeyValueStore creates a new instance of the KeyValueStore.
// The configuration contains information about the data centers,
// replication factors, and consistency levels.
func NewKeyValueStore(config Config) (KeyValueStore, error)
```

**Config structure (example):**

```go
type Config struct {
	DataCenters []DataCenterConfig
	ReplicationFactor int // Number of replicas for each key.
	ConsistencyLevel ConsistencyLevel // Consistency level for read and write operations.
}

type DataCenterConfig struct {
	ID string // Unique identifier for the data center (e.g., "us-east-1").
	Nodes []string // List of node addresses within the data center (e.g., "node1:8080", "node2:8080").
}

type ConsistencyLevel string

const (
	ConsistencyLevelQuorum ConsistencyLevel = "quorum"  // Requires a quorum of replicas to agree.
	ConsistencyLevelStrong ConsistencyLevel = "strong"  // Requires all replicas to agree before completing write.
	ConsistencyLevelEventual ConsistencyLevel = "eventual" // Writes are propagated asynchronously.
)
```

**Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests (millions per second) and scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the data centers.
2.  **Geo-Distribution:** Data should be replicated across multiple geographically distributed data centers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
3.  **Consistency:** The system must support at least `ConsistencyLevelQuorum` consistency for both read and write operations. You may optionally support `ConsistencyLevelStrong` and `ConsistencyLevelEventual`.  Quorum consistency requires that a majority of the replicas for a given key must acknowledge a write before it is considered successful. Reads must also consult a majority of replicas to ensure they are reading the most up-to-date value.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to node failures and data center outages. Data should be automatically replicated to other available nodes or data centers in case of a failure.
5.  **Data Partitioning:** Implement a suitable data partitioning strategy (e.g., consistent hashing) to distribute data evenly across the nodes in the cluster.
6.  **Concurrency Control:** Implement appropriate concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., locks, Paxos, Raft) to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions. You need to select one suitable concurency control algorithm.
7.  **Optimizations:**
    *   Minimize latency for read and write operations.
    *   Optimize network bandwidth usage.
    *   Efficiently handle data replication and recovery.
8.  **Error Handling:** The system should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the client.

**Constraints:**

*   The key and value are strings.
*   The size of the key and value are limited to 1MB.
*   The number of data centers can vary.
*   The number of nodes in each data center can vary.
*   Network latency between data centers can be significant.
*   You are responsible for designing the internal data structures and communication protocols.
*   You cannot use any external database or caching system. You must implement the key-value store from scratch.

**Considerations:**

*   Consider using gRPC or other efficient communication protocols for inter-node communication.
*   Think about how to handle conflicting writes to the same key.
*   Design a mechanism for detecting and recovering from node failures.
*   Consider the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency.
*   Assume data center locations are fixed and known at initialization.
*   Assume network partitions are rare, but your solution should handle them gracefully if they occur.
*   The system must be able to handle sudden spikes in traffic.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts and practical implementation skills. It challenges you to design a real-world key-value store that can handle the demands of modern applications. Good luck!

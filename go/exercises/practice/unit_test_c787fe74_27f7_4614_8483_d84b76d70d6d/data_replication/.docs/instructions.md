## Question: Optimal Inter-Data Center Replication

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a highly available distributed database system that spans multiple geographically distributed data centers. Each data center holds a complete copy of the database. To ensure data consistency and availability, you need to implement a replication strategy. Data is written to one data center (the primary), and then replicated to all other data centers (replicas).

The challenge lies in optimizing the replication process considering network bandwidth limitations and data center operational costs.

You are given the following information:

*   `N`: The number of data centers, indexed from 0 to N-1.
*   `dataCenterCosts`: An array of length N, where `dataCenterCosts[i]` represents the operational cost of data center `i`. This cost is incurred *for each unit of data stored* in the data center *after replication*.
*   `bandwidthMatrix`: An N x N matrix, where `bandwidthMatrix[i][j]` represents the maximum bandwidth available between data center `i` and data center `j` (in units of data per second). Note that `bandwidthMatrix[i][j]` may not be equal to `bandwidthMatrix[j][i]`. If `bandwidthMatrix[i][j] == 0`, it means that there is no direct connection between data centers `i` and `j`.  All bandwidth values are non-negative.
*   `dataSize`: The size of the data to be replicated (in units of data).
*   `primaryDataCenter`: An integer representing the index of the primary data center (0 <= `primaryDataCenter` < N).

**Objective:**

Determine the optimal replication strategy to minimize the total cost, defined as the sum of:

1.  **Replication Time:** The time taken to replicate the data from the primary data center to all other data centers. This time is crucial, as it directly affects the availability and consistency of the system.

2.  **Data Storage Costs:** The sum of the operational costs of storing the replicated data across all *replica* data centers.  Each replica data center will store `dataSize` of data *after* replication.

The replication strategy involves determining the optimal path (direct or indirect) for data to flow from the primary data center to each replica data center. You can use other data centers as relays to reach the destination, but you must factor in bandwidth limitations and the impact on replication time.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 50`
*   `0 <= dataCenterCosts[i] <= 100`
*   `0 <= bandwidthMatrix[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `1 <= dataSize <= 1000`
*   `0 <= primaryDataCenter < N`
*   Assume that replication can occur in parallel, meaning that the primary data center can send data to multiple replicas simultaneously, subject to bandwidth limitations.  Intermediate nodes can also forward data while simultaneously receiving it, subject to their bandwidth limitations.
*   The replication time is determined by the *longest* time it takes to replicate the data to any single replica data center.
*   You need to minimize the sum of the replication time (in seconds) and the total data storage costs (in cost units).
*   The problem requires an efficient algorithm because a brute-force approach would likely exceed time limits for the larger input values.

**Input:**

The input will consist of the following:

*   `N`: Integer representing the number of data centers.
*   `dataCenterCosts`: An array of integers of size N, representing the operational costs of each data center.
*   `bandwidthMatrix`: A 2D array of integers of size N x N, representing the bandwidth between data centers.
*   `dataSize`: An integer representing the size of the data to be replicated.
*   `primaryDataCenter`: An integer representing the index of the primary data center.

**Output:**

Return a single floating-point number representing the minimum total cost (replication time + data storage costs). The replication time should be in seconds and data storage cost in cost unit.

**Example:**

```
N = 3
dataCenterCosts = [10, 20, 30]
bandwidthMatrix = [[0, 5, 10], [5, 0, 5], [10, 5, 0]]
dataSize = 100
primaryDataCenter = 0

Explanation:

Data center 0 (primary) needs to replicate to data centers 1 and 2.

Direct replication:
- 0 -> 1: Time = 100/5 = 20 seconds
- 0 -> 2: Time = 100/10 = 10 seconds
Replication Time = max(20, 10) = 20 seconds
Storage Costs = (100 * 20) + (100 * 30) = 5000
Total Cost = 20 + 5000 = 5020

Indirect replication (not necessarily optimal, just for example):
- 0 -> 2 -> 1:
- 0 -> 2: Time = 10 seconds
- 2 -> 1: Time = 100/5 = 20 seconds
Replication Time = max(10, 20) = 20 seconds
Storage Costs = (100 * 20) + (100 * 30) = 5000
Total Cost = 20 + 5000 = 5020

Optimal Solution: 5020
```

**Scoring:**

The solution will be evaluated based on correctness and efficiency. Solutions that time out for larger inputs will receive a lower score.

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, incorporating several complex elements:

**Problem Title: Distributed Rate Limiter with Tiered Access**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service.  This service needs to control the number of requests that clients can make to a set of backend resources. The rate limiter must be highly available, scalable, and provide tiered access based on client subscription levels.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter should be designed to run across multiple nodes (imagine a cluster of Go applications).  Requests can arrive at any node, and the rate limiting logic must be consistent across the entire system. Avoid single points of failure.

2.  **Tiered Access:** Clients are categorized into three tiers: `Free`, `Premium`, and `Enterprise`. Each tier has different rate limits, defined as requests per second (RPS):
    *   `Free`: 10 RPS
    *   `Premium`: 100 RPS
    *   `Enterprise`: 1000 RPS

3.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The rate limits for each tier *may change at runtime*.  Your service must be able to handle these changes without significant downtime or loss of request processing. The changes will be infrequent but need to be accommodated.

4.  **Atomic Operations:** Rate limiting decisions (checking if a request is allowed and incrementing counters) must be atomic to prevent race conditions in a distributed environment.

5.  **Efficient Data Structures:** Choose data structures that allow for fast lookups and updates.  Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and performance.

6.  **Minimal Latency:** The rate limiter should add minimal latency to request processing.  Each rate limiting check should ideally take only a few milliseconds.

7.  **Client Identification:** Clients are identified by a unique string ID.

8.  **Persistence (Optional but Recommended):** While not strictly required, consider how you might persist rate limit counters to survive restarts or failures. A simple in-memory solution will be accepted for the competition, but bonus points will be given for a robust persistent solution that doesn't sacrifice performance.

9.  **Scalability:** The solution should be able to handle a large number of clients (millions) and a high request rate (thousands of requests per second).

10. **API:** Provide a simple API with the following functionality:
    *   `Allow(clientID string) bool`:  Checks if the client with the given ID is allowed to make a request based on their tier and current rate limits. Returns `true` if the request is allowed, `false` otherwise.
    *   `SetTier(clientID string, tier string)`: Assign a tier to a client. Valid tier values are "Free", "Premium", and "Enterprise".
    *   `UpdateLimits(freeRPS int, premiumRPS int, enterpriseRPS int)`: Updates the rate limits for each tier.

11. **Error Handling:**  Handle errors gracefully.  Return appropriate error codes/messages when necessary.

**Considerations for Difficulty:**

*   **Distributed Coordination:** This is the core challenge.  How do you maintain consistent rate limiting state across multiple nodes?  Consider using distributed consensus algorithms, distributed locks, or other coordination mechanisms.
*   **Concurrency:** The rate limiter will be handling concurrent requests.  Proper synchronization is crucial to prevent data corruption and ensure accuracy.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to node failures.
*   **Optimization:** Strive for optimal performance in terms of latency, throughput, and resource consumption.

**Expected Output:**

The submission should include a well-documented Go package implementing the rate limiter service, along with clear instructions on how to build and run the service.  The code should be well-structured, readable, and follow Go best practices. The solution should also include a basic test suite that demonstrates the functionality of the rate limiter.

This problem emphasizes a real-world scenario with various design considerations. It requires a strong understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, data structures, and optimization techniques in Go. Good luck!

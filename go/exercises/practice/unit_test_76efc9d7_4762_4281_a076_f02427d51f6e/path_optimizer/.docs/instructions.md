Okay, challenge accepted. Here's a high-difficulty Go coding problem description, designed to be concise, complete, challenging, and aligned with LeetCode's "Hard" difficulty.

## Project Name

`PathfindingOptimizer`

## Question Description

Imagine you are developing a delivery service operating in a highly dynamic urban environment. The city is represented as a weighted, directed graph. Nodes represent locations (addresses), and edges represent roads connecting them. The weight of an edge represents the *time* it takes to traverse that road.  Crucially, the edge weights (travel times) are *not static*. They change over time due to traffic congestion, road closures, and other unpredictable events.

You are given the following:

1.  **A graph `G`:** Represented as an adjacency list where each key is a node (string representing an address) and each value is a list of `Edge` structs. The `Edge` struct contains the `to` (destination address as a string) and the `weightTimeline` (a slice of `TimeWeight` structs)
2.  **`Edge` struct:**
    ```go
    type Edge struct {
        to            string
        weightTimeline []TimeWeight
    }
    ```
3.  **`TimeWeight` struct:**
    ```go
    type TimeWeight struct {
        timestamp int  // Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)
        weight    int  // Travel time in seconds
    }
    ```
    The `weightTimeline` for a given edge is sorted by `timestamp` in ascending order. For any given timestamp, you must find the correct weight by finding the latest timestamp in the `weightTimeline` that is less than or equal to the given timestamp. If the timestamp is earlier than the first `TimeWeight` in the timeline, the edge is considered impassable at that time (weight is effectively infinite).
4.  **A set of delivery requests:**  Each request is represented as a struct:

    ```go
    type Request struct {
        from      string // Source address
        to        string // Destination address
        startTime int    // Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) - when the delivery *must* start
        deadline  int    // Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) - when the delivery *must* arrive
    }
    ```

5.  **A fleet of delivery vehicles:** Each vehicle can only handle one request at a time.

Your task is to implement a function `OptimizeRoutes` that takes the graph `G`, a slice of `Request` structs, and returns a slice of `Assignment` structs. The `Assignment` struct represents a delivery assignment:

```go
type Assignment struct {
    request     Request
    startTime   int // Actual start time of the delivery (Unix timestamp)
    arrivalTime int // Actual arrival time of the delivery (Unix timestamp)
    path        []string // Ordered list of addresses visited on the route (including source and destination)
}
```

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Feasibility:**  For each returned `Assignment`, the calculated `arrivalTime` must be *strictly* less than or equal to the `request.deadline`.
*   **Optimality:** Prioritize maximizing the number of fulfilled requests.  If multiple solutions fulfill the same number of requests, prioritize minimizing the total travel time (sum of `arrivalTime` - `startTime` for all fulfilled requests).
*   **Dynamic Edge Weights:** The travel time between locations *changes* based on the time of day, as defined by the `weightTimeline`. Your pathfinding algorithm must account for this. You cannot use a static shortest path algorithm.
*   **Efficiency:**  The graph can be large (thousands of nodes and edges).  The number of requests can also be significant.  Your solution must be efficient in terms of both time and memory.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   **Real-World Considerations:**  Consider that delivery vehicles cannot teleport. The `path` in the `Assignment` must represent a valid sequence of connected roads.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no path exists between two locations at a given time, or if no schedule can satisfy the constraints for a particular request.  If a request cannot be fulfilled, it should *not* be included in the returned `Assignment` slice.
*   **Valid Route:** The `path` in the Assignment struct must be a valid route. The first element must be `request.from`, the last element must be `request.to`, and each consecutive pair of nodes must have a direct edge.
*   **Start Time Constraint:** The `startTime` in the `Assignment` struct must be greater or equal to the `request.startTime`

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   The number of requests fulfilled.
*   The total travel time for fulfilled requests.
*   The correctness of the calculated paths and timestamps.
*   The efficiency of your algorithm (time and memory usage).
*   Handling of edge cases.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (likely a variant of Dijkstra's or A\* adapted for dynamic edge weights), scheduling heuristics, and careful consideration of real-world constraints. Good luck!

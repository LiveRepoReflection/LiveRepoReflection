## Question: Network Partitioning for Optimal Data Replication

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a data replication strategy for a distributed database system. The system consists of `n` nodes, each storing a subset of the total data. Due to network constraints and varying access patterns, the network between these nodes is prone to partitions, which can lead to inconsistencies if not handled correctly.

Your goal is to determine the **minimum number of replicas** for each data item such that even in the presence of network partitions, a **quorum** of replicas remains accessible and consistent for both read and write operations.

**Specifically:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The network is represented as an undirected graph where nodes are vertices and network links are edges. Due to the nature of the distributed system, the number of nodes `n` can be very large (up to 10^5).

2.  **Partition Model:** A network partition can split the network into multiple connected components. Your solution must guarantee data consistency even when the network is partitioned into up to `k` connected components.

3.  **Data Items:** There are `m` distinct data items stored across the nodes. The data items can be as many as 10^5.

4.  **Replica Placement:** You need to determine the optimal number of replicas, `r_i`, for each data item `i` and the placement strategy of these replicas across the nodes, to tolerate up to `k` network partitions. The target is to minimize the total number of replicas, `sum(r_i)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.

5.  **Quorum Requirement:** To ensure consistency, both read and write operations require a quorum of replicas to be accessible within a single connected component of the network. A quorum is defined as a majority of the replicas (more than half). In other words, if there are `r_i` replicas, at least `ceil(r_i / 2)` replicas must be available in at least one connected component after partitioning.

6.  **Constraints:**
    *   The number of replicas for any data item must be an integer.
    *   You need to determine the *minimum* number of replicas (`r_i`) for each data item that satisfies the quorum requirement under the `k`-partition model.
    *   Assume that the placement of the replicas is optimal.

7.  **Input:**
    *   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= n <= 10^5).
    *   `m`: The number of data items (1 <= m <= 10^5).
    *   `k`: The maximum number of network partitions to tolerate (1 <= k <= n).

8.  **Output:**
    *   The minimum total number of replicas required across all data items to ensure data consistency.

**Example:**

*   Input: `n = 5`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`

*   Explanation: To tolerate 2 partitions, each data item must have at least 3 replicas. If there are 2 partitions, with 3 replicas, one partition will always have at least `ceil(3/2) = 2` replicas.

*   Output: `9` (3 data items * 3 replicas each)

**Challenge:**

The primary challenge is to determine the *minimum* number of replicas required for each data item, considering the worst-case network partition scenario. The large input sizes require an efficient algorithm that avoids brute-force exploration of all possible partition combinations. The optimal placement of replicas also introduces additional complexity. This question tests your ability to reason about distributed systems, consistency protocols, and algorithmic efficiency.

**Note:**

You do not need to explicitly determine the placement of replicas. The problem assumes an optimal placement strategy and focuses on calculating the minimum number of replicas required per data item.

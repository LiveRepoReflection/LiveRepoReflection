## Question: Optimal Network Partitioning for Disaster Recovery

### Question Description

You are designing a disaster recovery strategy for a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of a network of interconnected services. In the event of a disaster affecting a subset of the network, the goal is to partition the remaining unaffected services into the largest possible independent functional clusters.

The network is represented as an undirected graph where:

*   **Nodes** represent individual services. Each service has a `recoveryCost` associated with restarting it.
*   **Edges** represent dependencies between services. If there's an edge between service A and service B, it means A depends on B and vice versa for basic functionality.

You are given:

1.  `n`: The number of services in the network (numbered from 0 to n-1).
2.  `edges`: A list of undirected edges representing dependencies between services. Each edge is a pair `(u, v)` indicating a dependency between services `u` and `v`.
3.  `affectedServices`: A set of service IDs that are considered to be affected by the disaster and therefore unavailable.
4.  `recoveryCosts`: an array, where `recoveryCosts[i]` is the recovery cost of service i.

Your task is to:

1.  Remove the affected services (nodes) and their associated edges from the network graph.
2.  Partition the remaining unaffected services into the maximum number of independent clusters. A cluster is considered independent if there are no edges connecting services within that cluster to services outside of it.
3.  Within all possible partitoning schemes that maximize the number of clusters, choose the scheme that minimizes the sum of the recovery costs of all services in all independent clusters.
4.  Return the minimum sum of recovery costs for the services in the independent clusters, under the optimal paritioning scheme.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `0 <= len(affectedServices) <= n`
*   `0 <= recoveryCosts[i] <= 1000`
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   The IDs of `affectedServices` will be unique.
*   The input graph will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges.

**Example:**

Let's say we have the following:

*   `n = 5`
*   `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`
*   `affectedServices = [1]`
*   `recoveryCosts = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

After removing affected service 1, we are left with the following graph structure:
* Two clusters: {0}, {2}, {3, 4}

The optimal solution will partition services {0, 2, 3, 4} into three independent clusters: `{0}`, `{2}`, and `{3, 4}`. The total recovery cost is `10 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 130`.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit. Consider the time complexity of your algorithm.
*   Memory usage should also be considered, especially for large graphs.

**Edge Cases:**

*   All services are affected.
*   No services are affected.
*   The graph is already fully disconnected.
*   Removing affected services results in a fully disconnected graph.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

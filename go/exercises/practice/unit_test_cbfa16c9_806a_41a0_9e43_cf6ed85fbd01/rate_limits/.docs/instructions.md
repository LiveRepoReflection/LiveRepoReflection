Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter.  This rate limiter should control the number of requests allowed from unique users across a cluster of services.

**Scenario:** Imagine a service that offers API access to a large number of users. To protect the service from abuse and ensure fair usage, a rate limiter is needed.  This rate limiter must be highly available, scalable, and able to handle a large volume of requests with low latency.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed:** The rate limiter should function correctly even when requests are handled by multiple service instances.  Assume these instances do not share memory directly and communicate over a network.
2.  **User-Specific Limits:** Each unique user should have their own rate limit.  The system should allow for different rate limits for different users, configurable at runtime.
3.  **Configurable Rate Limits:**  Rate limits should be definable in terms of requests per time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour).  The time window should be configurable.
4.  **Atomic Operations:**  Rate limiting logic must be atomic to prevent race conditions when multiple requests from the same user arrive concurrently at different service instances.
5.  **Low Latency:** The rate limiting check should add minimal overhead to the request processing time.  Aim for sub-millisecond latency.
6.  **High Availability:** The rate limiter should be resilient to failures.  If a component fails, the system should continue to operate, possibly with degraded performance (e.g., slightly less accurate rate limiting in the short term).
7.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be able to handle a large number of users and requests.  Consider how the design can scale horizontally as the number of users and requests increases.
8.  **Grace Period:** Implement a grace period. When a rate limit is exceeded, subsequent requests should be rejected. The user needs to wait a certain amount of time before making more requests.
9.  **Tiered Rate Limiting:** Support tiered rate limiting. Users are assigned to tiers. Higher tiers have higher rate limits.

**Input:**

The rate limiter will receive requests with the following information:

*   `userID` (string): A unique identifier for the user making the request.
*   `requestTimestamp` (int64): The timestamp of the request in Unix epoch milliseconds.
*   `userTier` (int): An integer representing the user's tier. Higher values mean higher tiers.

**Output:**

The rate limiter should return a boolean value:

*   `true`: If the request is allowed (i.e., the user is within their rate limit).
*   `false`: If the request is rejected (i.e., the user has exceeded their rate limit).

**Constraints:**

*   You must implement this in Go.
*   You can use external libraries and data stores (e.g., Redis, Memcached, a database) to implement the distributed state.  Justify your choice of data store and explain its impact on performance, scalability, and availability.  Consider the trade-offs.
*   Assume there is a mechanism (e.g., a configuration file, an API endpoint) to update user tiers and rate limits dynamically. Your design should accommodate these updates without requiring a restart.
*   Minimize the use of locks within your core rate limiting logic.  Consider using atomic operations or optimistic locking.
*   Consider different algorithms for rate limiting (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window, sliding window) and justify your choice based on the requirements.
*   The code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

**Considerations for Evaluation:**

*   Correctness: Does the rate limiter accurately enforce the configured rate limits?
*   Performance: What is the latency of the rate limiting check under high load?
*   Scalability: How does the system scale as the number of users and requests increases?
*   Availability: How does the system handle failures of individual components?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Design Justification:  Are the design choices well-justified, considering the trade-offs?
*   Handling Edge Cases: How does the rate limiter handle edge cases, such as clock skew between different service instances?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems principles, data structures, algorithms, and Go concurrency. Good luck!

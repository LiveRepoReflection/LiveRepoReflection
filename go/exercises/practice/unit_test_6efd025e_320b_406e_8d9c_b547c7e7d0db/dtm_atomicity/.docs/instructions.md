Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

`DistributedTransactionManager`

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a simplified, in-memory Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture. The DTM needs to ensure atomicity across multiple services when performing a business transaction. This involves implementing the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

**Scenario:** Imagine an e-commerce system where a user places an order. This order involves two services:

1.  **Order Service:** Creates the order record.
2.  **Inventory Service:** Decreases the stock of the ordered items.

The DTM must ensure that either both operations succeed (order created and inventory reduced) or both fail (no order created and inventory remains unchanged).

**Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction ID Generation:** The DTM must generate unique transaction IDs for each transaction.
2.  **Transaction Registration:** Services can register operations (functions) to be executed as part of a transaction with the DTM. Each operation takes a transaction ID as input and returns an error, if any.
3.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):**

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):** The DTM calls each registered operation (in any order) with the transaction ID. If all operations return successfully (or "vote" to commit), the DTM proceeds to Phase 2. If any operation returns an error, the DTM initiates the rollback procedure.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):**
        *   **Commit:** If all operations voted to commit in Phase 1, the DTM calls a separate "commit" function registered by each service (again, with the transaction ID).
        *   **Rollback:** If any operation voted to abort in Phase 1, the DTM calls a "rollback" function registered by each service (with the transaction ID).
4.  **Concurrency:** The DTM must handle concurrent transactions safely.  Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., mutexes, channels) to prevent race conditions.  The number of concurent transactions is limited.
5.  **Idempotency:** The commit and rollback operations MUST be idempotent.  That is, calling them multiple times with the same transaction ID should have the same effect as calling them once. This is crucial in a distributed system where network issues may cause retries.
6.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for Phase 1. If any service takes longer than a specified duration to prepare, the transaction should be rolled back. Assume network issues where services may hang forever.
7.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, including logging and appropriate error return values. You have to design your own error types.
8.  **Service Isolation:** The DTM should be designed in a way that it does not directly access the internal state of the Order or Inventory Services.  It only interacts with them through the registered functions.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be implemented in Go.
*   The DTM should be implemented as a Go package.
*   You can use standard Go libraries (e.g., `sync`, `time`, `context`).
*   You must design your own interfaces for service registration, commit, and rollback operations.
*   The solution must be well-documented and easily understandable.
*   The number of maximum concurent transactions is limited to 100.

**Example Usage (Conceptual):**

```go
// Simplified Example
dtm := NewDistributedTransactionManager()

txID := dtm.BeginTransaction()

// Register operations from Order Service and Inventory Service
dtm.Register(txID, orderService.PrepareOrder, orderService.CommitOrder, orderService.RollbackOrder)
dtm.Register(txID, inventoryService.PrepareInventory, inventoryService.CommitInventory, inventoryService.RollbackInventory)

err := dtm.EndTransaction(txID) // Executes 2PC
if err != nil {
    // Handle transaction failure (e.g., retry, alert)
    log.Println("Transaction failed:", err)
} else {
    log.Println("Transaction committed successfully")
}

```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity?
*   Concurrency Safety: Does the solution handle concurrent transactions without race conditions?
*   Idempotency: Are commit and rollback operations idempotent?
*   Timeout Handling: Does the solution properly handle timeouts during the prepare phase?
*   Error Handling: Does the solution handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Efficiency:  Is the implementation reasonably efficient in terms of resource usage?

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems principles, concurrency in Go, and robust error handling. It's designed to be challenging and allows for multiple valid approaches with different trade-offs. Good luck!

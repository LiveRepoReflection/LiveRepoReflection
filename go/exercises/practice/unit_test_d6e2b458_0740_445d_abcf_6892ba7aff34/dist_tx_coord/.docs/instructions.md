Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

## Project Name

`Distributed Transaction Coordinator`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building a simplified, yet robust, distributed transaction coordinator. This coordinator is responsible for orchestrating atomic transactions across multiple independent services. The system will mimic the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

Imagine a scenario where you have several microservices: `InventoryService`, `PaymentService`, and `ShippingService`. A user wants to place an order. This order involves:

1.  Reserving items in the `InventoryService`.
2.  Processing payment via the `PaymentService`.
3.  Scheduling shipment via the `ShippingService`.

All these operations must happen atomically. Either all succeed, or none should. If any of them fail, the changes made by the others must be rolled back.

Your task is to implement a `TransactionCoordinator` in Go that manages these distributed transactions.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Service Interface:** Define a standard interface `Service` that all participating services must implement.  This interface should have two methods: `Prepare()` and `CommitRollback(bool)`. `Prepare()` simulates the service preparing to commit the transaction (e.g., checking if it has enough resources).  `CommitRollback(bool)` either commits the prepared changes (if the boolean is true) or rolls them back (if the boolean is false).  Each service preparation and commit/rollback can take up to 100ms, which it should simulate by sleeping for that amount of time.
```go
type Service interface {
	Prepare() error
	CommitRollback(commit bool) error
	GetName() string
}
```
2.  **Transaction Coordinator:** Implement the `TransactionCoordinator` struct with a `Begin()` and `End()` method. `Begin()` starts a new transaction and allows services to register themselves. `End(commit bool)` attempts to commit the transaction across all registered services. If `commit` is false, it rolls back the transaction.

    *   The `Begin()` function should return a unique `TransactionID`.
    *   The `End()` function should return an error containing which services failed.
    *   The `TransactionCoordinator` should handle concurrent transactions correctly, avoiding race conditions.
    *   The `TransactionCoordinator` should be able to handle a maximum of `N` concurrent transactions. Where `N` is passed in on initialization.
    *   The `TransactionCoordinator` has a queue size `M` that handles all incoming service requests. Where `M` is passed in on initialization.
```go
type TransactionCoordinator struct {
	// Implementation details...
}

func NewTransactionCoordinator(concurrency int, queueSize int) *TransactionCoordinator {
	// Implementation details...
}

func (tc *TransactionCoordinator) Begin() TransactionID {
	// Implementation details...
}

func (tc *TransactionCoordinator) Register(transactionID TransactionID, service Service) error {
	// Implementation details...
}

func (tc *TransactionCoordinator) End(transactionID TransactionID, commit bool) error {
	// Implementation details...
}
```

3.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. If any service fails during the `Prepare()` phase, the entire transaction must be rolled back. If any service fails during `CommitRollback(true)` (commit), log the error and continue to attempt committing other services. If any service fails during `CommitRollback(false)` (rollback), log the error and continue to attempt rolling back other services.  The `End()` method should return an error if any service failed during the process, including a list of the services that failed.

4.  **Concurrency:** The `Prepare()` and `CommitRollback()` methods of the services and the `End()` method of the `TransactionCoordinator` must be executed concurrently using goroutines to minimize the overall transaction time. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels, waitgroups) to ensure data consistency and avoid race conditions.

5.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism. If any service takes longer than 500ms to `Prepare()` or `CommitRollback()`, consider it a failure and roll back/abort the transaction.

6.  **Deadlock Prevention:** Carefully design your solution to avoid deadlocks. This is a crucial aspect of distributed transaction systems. Think about the order in which you acquire resources and how you handle potential conflicts.

7.  **Idempotency:** While not explicitly enforced, consider the idempotency of the `CommitRollback()` operations in your design. In a real-world system, these operations should ideally be idempotent to handle potential network issues and retries.

8.  **Scalability Considerations:** Although you don't need to implement actual scaling, think about how your design would scale to handle a large number of transactions and services.  For example, how would you shard the transaction data?

**Constraints:**

*   You are free to define the `Service` implementations (`InventoryService`, `PaymentService`, `ShippingService`), but they must adhere to the `Service` interface.  These are simulated services, so their actual functionality is not critical; focus on the transaction coordination logic.
*   The number of registered services per transaction can vary.
*   The system must be resilient to individual service failures.
*   Minimize the overall transaction execution time.
*   Each function will have a maximum time limit of 10 seconds.

This problem tests your understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, error handling, and system design principles in Go. It requires you to build a robust and efficient solution that can handle complex scenarios. Good luck!

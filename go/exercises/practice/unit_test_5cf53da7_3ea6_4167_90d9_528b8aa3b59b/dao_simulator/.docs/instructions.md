## Question: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Simulation

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a simulation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that manages a shared treasury and makes decisions through voting. The DAO operates on a simplified blockchain where each block represents a time step. The goal is to implement the core logic for handling proposals, voting, and treasury management within a given block processing cycle.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Treasury:** The DAO holds a treasury of digital assets (represented as integers).

2.  **Members:** Each member has a unique ID (integer) and a voting power (integer).

3.  **Proposals:** Members can submit proposals to spend funds from the treasury. Each proposal has:
    *   An ID (integer).
    *   The proposer's ID (integer).
    *   The amount of assets to spend (integer).
    *   A start block number (integer).
    *   An end block number (integer).

4.  **Votes:** Members can vote "yes" or "no" on active proposals.

5.  **Block Processing:** At each block, the DAO processes active proposals, tallies votes, and executes successful proposals.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `ProcessBlock` that simulates the DAO's operation for a single block. The function takes the following inputs:

*   `blockNumber` (int): The current block number.
*   `treasury` (int): The current treasury balance.
*   `members` (map[int]int): A map of member IDs to their voting power.
*   `activeProposals` (map[int]Proposal): A map of proposal IDs to their Proposal structs.
*   `votes` (map[int]map[int]bool): A map of proposal IDs to a map of member IDs to their vote (true for "yes", false for "no").

The `Proposal` struct is defined as:

```go
type Proposal struct {
    ID          int
    ProposerID  int
    Amount      int
    StartBlock  int
    EndBlock    int
}
```

The `ProcessBlock` function should perform the following steps:

1.  **Proposal Filtering:** Identify proposals that are active in the current block (i.e., `StartBlock <= blockNumber <= EndBlock`).

2.  **Vote Tallying:** For each active proposal, calculate the total voting power for "yes" votes and the total voting power for "no" votes.

3.  **Proposal Outcome:** A proposal passes if the total voting power for "yes" votes is strictly greater than the total voting power for "no" votes AND the treasury has enough funds to cover the proposal's amount.

4.  **Treasury Update:** If a proposal passes and the treasury has sufficient funds, deduct the proposal's amount from the treasury.

5.  **Output:** Return the updated treasury balance after processing all active proposals.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Invalid Proposals:** Handle cases where a proposal's `Amount` is negative or zero. These proposals should be ignored.
*   **Insufficient Funds:** If the treasury does not have enough funds to cover a successful proposal, the proposal should NOT be executed, and the treasury balance should remain unchanged.
*   **Zero Voting Power:** Handle cases where a member has zero voting power. Their votes should be ignored.
*   **Duplicate Votes:** If a member votes multiple times on the same proposal, only consider their last vote.
*   **Proposal Overlap:** Multiple proposals can be active in the same block. Process them in the order of their Proposal ID.
*   **Large Scale:** Assume that the number of members, proposals, and votes can be large, requiring efficient data structures and algorithms. The number of proposals can go up to 10^5, the number of members can go up to 10^6 and the number of votes can go up to 10^7. Aim for a solution with O(n+m+v) or O(n log n) where n is the number of proposals, m the number of members and v the number of votes.
*   **Integer Overflow:** Be mindful of potential integer overflows when calculating voting power or updating the treasury.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Time Complexity:** Your solution should be efficient enough to handle a large number of members, proposals, and votes.
*   **Space Complexity:** Minimize memory usage. Avoid unnecessary data copying or storage.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must accurately simulate the DAO's behavior and handle all edge cases.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This question requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. It challenges the solver to write efficient and robust code that can handle a complex real-world scenario. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a candidate's understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

**Project Name:** `distributed-meeting-scheduler`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a distributed meeting scheduler for a large organization. The organization consists of `N` employees distributed across `M` geographically dispersed offices. Each employee has a daily schedule consisting of several time slots, some of which are marked as "busy" (already occupied by other meetings or tasks) and some are "free." Each time slot is of a fixed duration (e.g., 30 minutes).

Your scheduler must find the *minimum number* of meeting rooms needed to accommodate a set of meeting requests, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Employee Availability:** A meeting can only be scheduled if *all* attendees are free during the proposed time slot.

2.  **Office Capacity:** Each office has a limited number of meeting rooms. A meeting can only be scheduled in an office if there's a room available during the requested time slot.

3.  **Network Latency:** Due to network latency, scheduling a meeting that involves employees from different offices incurs a communication cost. This cost is proportional to the number of distinct offices involved in the meeting.  Minimize the total communication cost across all scheduled meetings.

4.  **Meeting Priority:** Each meeting has a priority level (integer, higher value means higher priority). The scheduler should preferentially schedule higher-priority meetings. If two schedules require the same number of meeting rooms, then the schedule which accommodate higher priority meetings should be preferrable.

5.  **Scalability:** The system should handle a large number of employees, offices, and meeting requests efficiently.  Consider the time complexity of your solution.

**Input:**

The input will be provided through several channels:

*   **Employee Schedules:** A list of employee schedules is provided. Each schedule indicates `EmployeeID`, `OfficeID`, and a list of time slots (e.g., integers representing 30-minute intervals from the start of the day), each marked as either "busy" or "free."

*   **Office Capacities:** A list of office capacities, indicating `OfficeID` and the number of meeting rooms available in that office.

*   **Meeting Requests:** A list of meeting requests, each containing:
    *   `MeetingID` (unique identifier)
    *   `Attendees`: A list of `EmployeeID`s.
    *   `Duration`: The number of time slots the meeting requires.
    *   `TimeSlotOptions`: A list of possible start time slots for the meeting.
    *   `Priority`: An integer representing the meeting's priority.

**Output:**

The output should be a list of scheduled meetings, where each entry includes:

*   `MeetingID`
*   `OfficeID` (where the meeting is scheduled)
*   `StartTimeSlot`

If a meeting cannot be scheduled, it should *not* be included in the output.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10,000` (Number of employees)
*   `1 <= M <= 100` (Number of offices)
*   The number of time slots per day is fixed (e.g., 48 slots for 30-minute intervals).
*   The number of meeting requests can be up to `1,000`.
*   The number of attendees per meeting can vary.
*   The maximum meeting duration is 4 time slots (2 hours).
*   Assume that the `EmployeeID` and `OfficeID` are integers.
*   Your solution must complete within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1 minute).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

The solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria, in order of importance:

1.  **Correctness:** The solution must correctly schedule meetings according to the constraints.
2.  **Minimization of Meeting Rooms:** The primary goal is to minimize the *total number* of meeting rooms used across *all* offices.
3.  **Minimization of Communication Cost:**  Secondary goal is to minimize the communication cost (number of offices involved).
4.  **Meeting Priority:** Higher priority meetings should be scheduled preferentially.
5.  **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient and scalable. Timeouts will result in penalties.
6.  **Code Quality:** Code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a combination of graph-based reasoning (to model employee availability and meeting compatibility), resource allocation (meeting rooms), and optimization (communication cost, meeting priority). The large scale of the input necessitates careful consideration of algorithmic complexity and data structure choices. Several valid approaches are possible, each with different trade-offs between optimality and execution time. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition, incorporating elements of advanced data structures, optimization, edge cases, and real-world application.

**Problem Title:**  Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified distributed key-value store that supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions across multiple nodes. The key-value store consists of `N` nodes, each with a limited amount of memory.

**System Overview:**

*   **Nodes:** Each node in the system is identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. Each node has a local key-value store implemented using an in-memory data structure (e.g., a `map[string]string`). Each node also has a limited memory capacity, represented by `M` bytes. Storing a key-value pair consumes `len(key) + len(value)` bytes of memory on the node.
*   **Transactions:** Transactions are initiated by a client and involve operations on multiple nodes. A transaction consists of a series of read and write operations.
*   **Read Operation:** A read operation `Read(nodeID, key)` retrieves the value associated with `key` from the node with ID `nodeID`. If the key does not exist, it returns an empty string.
*   **Write Operation:** A write operation `Write(nodeID, key, value)` stores the `key` and `value` on the node with ID `nodeID`. The write operation must check if the node has sufficient memory to store the new key-value pair. If there is insufficient memory, the write operation should fail.
*   **Commit/Abort:** After a series of read and write operations, a transaction can either be committed or aborted.
    *   **Commit:** If a transaction is committed, all write operations performed within the transaction should be made permanent across all involved nodes.
    *   **Abort:** If a transaction is aborted, all write operations performed within the transaction should be rolled back, and the system should return to its state before the transaction started.
*   **Concurrency:** Multiple transactions can run concurrently. You need to ensure that transactions are properly isolated from each other, preventing data corruption and inconsistencies.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Implement a `Transaction` struct and associated methods:**

    *   `Begin()`: Starts a new transaction.
    *   `Read(nodeID int, key string) (string, error)`: Reads a value from a node within the transaction.
    *   `Write(nodeID int, key string, value string) error`: Writes a value to a node within the transaction.
    *   `Commit() error`: Commits the transaction.
    *   `Abort() error`: Aborts the transaction.

2.  **Implement a `Node` struct representing a single node in the key-value store.**

3.  **Implement a `Coordinator` struct, responsible for managing transactions and coordinating operations across multiple nodes.** The Coordinator should handle:

    *   Transaction initiation and termination (commit/abort).
    *   Concurrency control (e.g., using locks).
    *   Ensuring ACID properties.
    *   Memory management on each node.

**Constraints:**

*   **Atomicity:** All operations within a transaction must either succeed or fail as a single unit.
*   **Consistency:** Transactions must maintain the consistency of the key-value store.
*   **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions must be isolated from each other to prevent data corruption.
*   **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes must be durable, even in the event of node failures (assume in-memory durability for simplicity - no disk persistence required for this problem).
*   **Memory Limits:** Each node has a limited memory capacity. Write operations must fail if there is insufficient memory.
*   **Concurrency:** Your solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent transactions efficiently.
*   **Optimization:** Aim for minimal lock contention and efficient memory usage.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to deal with node failures, memory constraints, and concurrency conflicts.
*   **2-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:**  You **must** implement a simplified version of the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity across all nodes involved in a transaction.

**Input:**

Your code will be tested with a series of transaction requests, each containing a sequence of read and write operations, followed by a commit or abort decision.  The input will be provided through function calls to your `Coordinator` and `Transaction` methods.

**Output:**

Your code should return appropriate error codes to indicate the success or failure of each operation.  The final state of the key-value store across all nodes should reflect the committed transactions.

**Example Scenario:**

1.  A transaction begins.
2.  The transaction reads key "A" from node 1.
3.  The transaction writes key "B" with value "valueB" to node 2.
4.  The transaction writes key "C" with value "valueC" to node 3.
5.  The transaction commits.
6.  The changes to node 2 and node 3 should be permanent.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Your solution must correctly implement the distributed key-value store and ensure ACID properties.
*   Efficiency: Your solution must handle concurrent transactions efficiently and minimize lock contention.
*   Memory Usage: Your solution must manage memory efficiently and respect the memory limits of each node.
*   Error Handling: Your solution must handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
*   Code Quality: Your code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Adherence to 2PC: Correct implementation of a simplified 2PC is crucial.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, data structures, and algorithms. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level.

**Project Name:** `AutonomousNetworkOptimization`

**Question Description:**

You are designing an autonomous network management system for a large-scale data center. The data center consists of `N` servers, each identified by a unique integer from `0` to `N-1`. The servers are interconnected in a network, where connections are represented as undirected edges. The network topology is given as a list of edges `edges`, where each edge `[u, v]` indicates a connection between server `u` and server `v`.

Each server has a processing capacity `capacity[i]` and a current load `load[i]`. The goal is to minimize the maximum load on any server in the network by strategically migrating load between servers.

You are given the following constraints:

1.  **Network Connectivity:** The network is guaranteed to be connected.
2.  **Load Balancing:**  Load can be migrated between directly connected servers.  You can migrate any amount of load from server `u` to server `v` (or vice-versa) as long as the resulting load on each server remains non-negative.  The load must be an integer.
3.  **Capacity Constraints:** The load on each server *must not exceed* its capacity. After the migration, `0 <= load[i] <= capacity[i]` for all servers `i`.
4.  **Migration Cost:** Migrating load has a cost associated with it. The cost of migrating `x` units of load between servers `u` and `v` is `x`. The total cost should be minimized.

Your task is to write a function `OptimizeNetwork(N int, capacity []int, load []int, edges [][]int) int` that returns the **minimum possible value** of the **maximum load** on any server in the network after optimally migrating load, while also minimizing the total migration cost. The returned value must be an integer. If it's not possible to balance the network while respecting capacity constraints, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100` (Number of servers)
*   `0 <= capacity[i] <= 1000` for all `i` (Server capacity)
*   `0 <= load[i] <= 1000` for all `i` (Initial server load)
*   `0 <= edges.length <= N * (N - 1) / 2` (Number of connections)
*   `0 <= u, v < N` for each edge `[u, v]`
*   The sum of all `load[i]` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the sum of all `capacity[i]`. This means a feasible solution *always* exists.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The solution must be efficient, especially for larger networks (N close to 100). Brute-force approaches will likely time out.  Consider algorithmic efficiency in terms of both time and space complexity. Focus on minimizing the *maximum* load, and secondarily minimize migration cost to achieve that minimum maximum load.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Handle cases where initial loads are already balanced.
*   Consider scenarios with very uneven load distributions.
*   Think about the structure of the network (e.g., sparse vs. dense connections).

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints. Good luck!

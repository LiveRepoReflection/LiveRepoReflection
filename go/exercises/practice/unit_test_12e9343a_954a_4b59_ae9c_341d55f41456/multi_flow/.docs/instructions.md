Okay, I'm ready. Here's a coding problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated for Go.

## Problem: Optimized Multi-Commodity Flow

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the flow of multiple commodities through a network represented as a directed graph. The network represents a transportation system, where nodes are locations and edges are transportation routes. Each route has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of goods that can be transported through it.

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network, numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, capacity)` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with the given `capacity`. All capacities are integers.
*   `commodities`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(source, sink, demand)` represents a commodity that needs to be transported from `source` to `sink` with the given `demand`. Each commodity is independent. All demands are integers.

Your goal is to determine the maximum possible flow for **each** commodity, respecting the capacity constraints of the edges. The total flow through any edge (summed across all commodities) must not exceed its capacity.

**Output:**

Return a slice of integers `flows` where `flows[i]` represents the maximum flow that can be achieved for the i-th commodity, `commodities[i]`.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 100
*   0 <= len(edges) <= 500
*   0 <= len(commodities) <= 100
*   0 <= u, v < N for all edges (u, v, capacity)
*   0 <= source, sink < N for all commodities (source, sink, demand)
*   0 <= capacity <= 1000 for all edges (u, v, capacity)
*   0 <= demand <= 1000 for all commodities (source, sink, demand)
*   Multiple edges can exist between two nodes but the sum of their capacities must not exceed 1000.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). A naive implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for each commodity may not be sufficient. You should consider more efficient algorithms, such as Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm, or a clever way to handle multiple commodities together.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph may not be connected.
*   There may be no path between a source and sink for a commodity.
*   The demand for a commodity may be greater than the maximum possible flow between its source and sink.
*   The network may have cycles.
*   Source and sink nodes for a commodity can be the same.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
edges = [
    (0, 1, 10),
    (0, 2, 5),
    (1, 2, 15),
    (1, 3, 10),
    (2, 3, 20)
]
commodities = [
    (0, 3, 5),
    (1, 2, 8)
]

Output: [5, 8]
```

**Explanation:**

*   For the first commodity (0 -> 3, demand 5), the maximum flow is 5.
*   For the second commodity (1 -> 2, demand 8), the maximum flow is 8.

**Scoring:**

Solutions will be judged based on correctness, efficiency, and code clarity. Solutions that handle all edge cases and meet the efficiency requirements will receive full credit. Solutions with good code clarity will be preferred.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, network flow concepts, and efficient coding practices. Good luck!

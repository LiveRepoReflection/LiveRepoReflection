Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed with the specified constraints in mind.

## Problem: Decentralized Transaction Ordering

**Question Description:**

You are building a component for a high-throughput, decentralized finance (DeFi) application.  This application relies on a network of validator nodes that receive and process transactions.  Due to network latency and varying processing speeds, transactions arrive at different validators in different orders.  The goal is to implement a mechanism that allows each validator to independently and efficiently determine a globally consistent, deterministic transaction order.

Specifically, you need to implement a function `OrderTransactions` that takes as input a slice of `Transaction` structs and returns a slice of `Transaction` structs representing the globally consistent order.

**Transaction Struct:**

```go
type Transaction struct {
	ID        string    // Unique transaction ID (UUID).
	Submitter string    // Public key of the transaction submitter.
	Data      []byte    // Arbitrary transaction data.
	Timestamp int64     // Nanosecond-precision timestamp of when the transaction was first seen by *any* node.
	Priority  uint64    // Explicit priority for transaction ordering. Lower values mean higher priority.
  	Conflicts []string // A list of transaction IDs that conflict with this transaction.
}
```

**Requirements:**

1.  **Deterministic Ordering:** Given the *same* set of transactions, the `OrderTransactions` function *must* produce the *same* output order, regardless of the validator node executing the function.

2.  **Timestamp-Based Ordering:** Transactions should primarily be ordered by their `Timestamp` field.  Older transactions must come before newer transactions.

3.  **Priority-Based Ordering:** If two transactions have the same `Timestamp`, the transaction with the *lower* `Priority` value should come first.

4.  **Conflict Resolution:** The `Conflicts` field represents a list of transaction IDs that conflict with the current transaction. If transaction A conflicts with transaction B (i.e., A.Conflicts contains B.ID or B.Conflicts contains A.ID), and A and B have the same `Timestamp` and `Priority`, then the transaction with the *lexicographically smaller ID* should come first.  Note that conflict relationships are not necessarily transitive.

5.  **Liveness Guarantee:**  The algorithm *must* eventually produce a valid order for all transactions, even in the presence of conflicts and identical timestamps/priorities. You must avoid potential deadlocks.

6.  **Efficiency:** The `OrderTransactions` function must be efficient, with a target complexity of better than O(n^2) in the average case, where n is the number of transactions.  Consider the trade-offs between time and space complexity.

7.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle empty input gracefully (return an empty slice).
    *   Handle duplicate transaction IDs in the input (treat them as separate transactions with the same ID).
    *   Handle a large number of conflicting transactions.
    *   Handle scenarios where multiple transactions have identical timestamps, priorities, and conflicting transaction IDs.

**Function Signature:**

```go
func OrderTransactions(transactions []Transaction) []Transaction {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

**Constraints:**

*   You **cannot** rely on any external consensus mechanism or global state. Each validator node must perform this ordering independently.
*   You **cannot** modify the `Transaction` struct.
*   You **must** use standard Go libraries only. No external dependencies are allowed.

**Example:**
(Illustrative and incomplete)

Input:

```go
transactions := []Transaction{
    {ID: "B", Submitter: "Alice", Timestamp: 100, Priority: 1, Conflicts: []string{"A"}},
    {ID: "A", Submitter: "Bob", Timestamp: 100, Priority: 1, Conflicts: []string{"B"}},
    {ID: "C", Submitter: "Charlie", Timestamp: 200, Priority: 0, Conflicts: []string{}},
}
```

Possible Output:

```go
[]Transaction{
    {ID: "A", Submitter: "Bob", Timestamp: 100, Priority: 1, Conflicts: []string{"B"}},
    {ID: "B", Submitter: "Alice", Timestamp: 100, Priority: 1, Conflicts: []string{"A"}},
    {ID: "C", Submitter: "Charlie", Timestamp: 200, Priority: 0, Conflicts: []string{}},
}
```

(Note: "A" comes before "B" due to lexicographical ordering of IDs because they have the same Timestamp, Priority, and conflict with each other.)

This problem requires a combination of sorting algorithms, data structures, and careful consideration of edge cases to achieve the required deterministic ordering and efficiency. Good luck!

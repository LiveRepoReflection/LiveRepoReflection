Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level problem. It focuses on graph algorithms, optimization, and handling real-world constraints.

## Problem: Minimum Cost Flight Planner

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a flight planner that determines the minimum cost to travel between a source city and a destination city, given a complex network of flights with varying costs and constraints.

You are given the following information:

*   **`n`**: The number of cities, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
*   **`flights`**: A list of flights, where each flight is represented as `[source, destination, departure_time, arrival_time, cost]`.
    *   `source` and `destination` are city indices (0 to `n-1`).
    *   `departure_time` and `arrival_time` are represented as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch).
    *   `cost` is the cost of the flight.
*   **`src`**: The source city index.
*   **`dst`**: The destination city index.
*   **`start_time`**: The earliest time (Unix timestamp) the journey can begin at the source city.
*   **`max_layover`**: The maximum layover time (in seconds) allowed between flights.  A layover is defined as the time spent in a city between the arrival of one flight and the departure of the next.  A layover *must* occur if you take more than one flight.
*   **`max_flights`**: The maximum number of flights allowed in the journey.  A direct flight counts as one flight.

**Objective:**

Write a function that calculates the minimum cost to travel from the source city `src` to the destination city `dst`, starting no earlier than `start_time`, while adhering to the `max_layover` and `max_flights` constraints.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100` (Number of cities)
*   `0 <= len(flights) <= 1000`
*   `0 <= source, destination < n`
*   `0 <= departure_time, arrival_time <= 10^10`
*   `1 <= cost <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= src, dst < n`
*   `0 <= start_time <= 10^10`
*   `0 <= max_layover <= 10^7` (seconds)
*   `1 <= max_flights <= 10`

**Return Value:**

*   Return the minimum cost to travel from `src` to `dst` under the given constraints.
*   If no valid route exists, return `-1`.

**Complexity Considerations:**

*   The number of possible paths can grow exponentially.  Naive approaches will likely time out.
*   Efficient data structures and algorithms are required to find the optimal solution within the time limit.

**Example:**

Let's say we have the following data:

```
n = 3
flights = [[0, 1, 10, 20, 100], [1, 2, 30, 40, 200], [0, 2, 10, 50, 350]]
src = 0
dst = 2
start_time = 5
max_layover = 15
max_flights = 2
```

A possible solution might involve taking the direct flight from city 0 to city 2, which costs 350.  Another option (if allowed by `max_layover`) is to fly from 0 to 1, then from 1 to 2, which would cost 100 + 200 = 300.

The function should return 300, as it's the minimum cost.

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Timeouts:** Solutions that are not optimized will likely time out on larger test cases.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider cases where the source and destination are the same, no flights exist, or no valid route is possible.
*   **Real-World:** The problem models a simplified real-world flight planning scenario, making it relatable.

This problem encourages the use of graph algorithms (like Dijkstra's or potentially A* with a carefully chosen heuristic), dynamic programming, and careful optimization to handle the time constraints. It also requires careful handling of edge cases and constraint validation. Good luck!

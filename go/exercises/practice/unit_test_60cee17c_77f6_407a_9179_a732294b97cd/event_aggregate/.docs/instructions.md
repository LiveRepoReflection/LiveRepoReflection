Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging for Go programmers, incorporating elements you requested:

**Problem Title:** Decentralized Event Stream Aggregation

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system to aggregate events from a decentralized network of event producers. Each producer generates a stream of events. These events are timestamped and categorized. Your system should efficiently collect, aggregate, and provide real-time analytics on these events, subject to the constraints of a decentralized environment.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Event Producers:** Assume there are a large number (potentially millions) of event producers distributed across a network.  Each producer emits events in the following format:

    ```go
    type Event struct {
        Timestamp int64  // Unix timestamp in nanoseconds
        Category  string // Event category (e.g., "payment", "login", "error")
        Value     int    // Numerical value associated with the event
        ProducerID string // Unique identifier for the producer
    }
    ```

    Events are transmitted over unreliable network connections, and producers may go offline at any time.

2.  **Aggregation Nodes:**  Implement a set of aggregation nodes that collect events from the producers.  These nodes form a distributed network.  Each aggregation node is responsible for receiving events from a subset of producers and aggregating them.
    *   **Data Partitioning:** Design an efficient and scalable strategy for partitioning the event producers across aggregation nodes.  Consider using consistent hashing or other suitable techniques.
    *   **Fault Tolerance:** Aggregation nodes should be able to handle producer failures and node failures gracefully. Data loss should be minimized. Consider using replication or other redundancy mechanisms.
    *   **Eventual Consistency:** Strict consistency is not required.  The system should strive for eventual consistency, meaning that analytics will converge to accurate values over time, even with node failures and network issues.

3.  **Analytics Queries:**  Implement the following analytics queries:

    *   `CountEvents(category string, startTime int64, endTime int64) int`: Returns the total number of events of a given category within a specified time range.
    *   `SumValues(category string, startTime int64, endTime int64) int`: Returns the sum of the `Value` field for events of a given category within a specified time range.
    *   `TopKProducers(category string, startTime int64, endTime int64, k int) []string`: Returns a list of the top `k` producers (by number of events) for a given category within a specified time range. The list should be sorted in descending order of event count.

4.  **Performance Requirements:**

    *   **High Throughput:** The system should be able to handle a high volume of events (e.g., millions of events per second across the entire network).
    *   **Low Latency:**  Analytics queries should return results quickly (e.g., within a few seconds).
    *   **Scalability:**  The system should be able to scale horizontally by adding more aggregation nodes to handle increasing event volumes.

5.  **Memory Constraints:**  Each aggregation node has limited memory. Design your data structures and algorithms to minimize memory usage.  Consider using approximate data structures (e.g., Bloom filters, HyperLogLog) for certain analytics queries.

6.  **Real-Time Considerations:**  The system should provide near real-time analytics.  Consider using techniques like streaming aggregation or windowing to process events as they arrive.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of aggregation nodes is significantly smaller than the number of event producers.
*   Network connections between producers and aggregation nodes are unreliable.
*   Aggregation nodes have limited memory.
*   You are free to use external libraries and frameworks, but you must justify your choices and explain how they contribute to the overall solution.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  The analytics queries must return accurate results (or reasonable approximations, if using approximate data structures).
*   **Performance:**  The system must meet the throughput and latency requirements.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to scale horizontally by adding more aggregation nodes.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  The system must be able to handle producer failures and node failures gracefully.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** The solution should minimize memory usage on aggregation nodes.
*   **Code Quality:**  The code should be well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and Go programming. It challenges the solver to design a scalable, fault-tolerant, and performant system for real-time event stream aggregation. It also forces trade-offs between accuracy, latency, memory usage, and complexity. Good luck!

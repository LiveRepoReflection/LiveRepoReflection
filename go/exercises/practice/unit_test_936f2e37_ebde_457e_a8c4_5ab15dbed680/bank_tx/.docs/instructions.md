Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at a similar difficulty level to LeetCode Hard, incorporating many of the elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `distributed-transaction-simulator`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified simulator for distributed transactions in a banking system. The system consists of `N` independent bank branches, each represented by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. Each branch maintains its own account balance.

A *transaction* involves transferring funds between two branches. Due to the distributed nature of the system, transactions must be executed using a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol to ensure atomicity (all or nothing).

Your simulator must handle the following operations:

1.  **`Initialize(N int, initialBalances []int)`:** Initializes the system with `N` branches. `initialBalances` is an array of length `N` specifying the initial balance of each branch. If `len(initialBalances) != N`, return an error. All initial balances must be non-negative.

2.  **`Transfer(from int, to int, amount int) error`:** Attempts to transfer `amount` from branch `from` to branch `to`. This operation must follow the 2PC protocol:

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):**
        *   Check if `from` and `to` are valid branch IDs (0 <= ID < N).  Return an error if not.
        *   Check if the `from` branch has sufficient funds (`balance >= amount`). Return an error if not.
        *   "Reserve" the amount at both the `from` and `to` branches. This reservation prevents other concurrent transactions from interfering with the current transaction. You need to maintain internal data structures for reservations.  The reservation should be identified by a unique transaction ID (UUID is fine).
        *   Return `nil` (no error) if all checks pass successfully.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):**
        *   If the transaction succeeds (i.e., the Prepare phase returned no error):
            *   Deduct `amount` from `from` branch's balance.
            *   Add `amount` to `to` branch's balance.
            *   Release the reservations.
        *   If the transaction fails (i.e., the Prepare phase returned an error):
            *   Release the reservations.
            *   Do *not* modify any balances.
        *   Return `nil` (no error) to indicate completion of the commit/rollback.

3.  **`GetBalance(branch int) (int, error)`:** Returns the current balance of the specified `branch`. Returns an error if the branch ID is invalid.

4.  **`SimulateNetworkPartition(branches []int) error`:** Simulates a network partition, causing the specified `branches` to become temporarily unavailable. Subsequent `Transfer` or `GetBalance` calls to these branches should return an error, indicating that the branch is unavailable.

5.  **`RecoverNetworkPartition(branches []int) error`:** Recovers the network partition for the specified `branches`, making them available again.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:**  The system must support concurrent `Transfer` and `GetBalance` operations. Implement appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
*   **Atomicity:**  Transactions must be atomic.  Either the entire transfer succeeds, or nothing changes.  Use the 2PC protocol correctly.
*   **Isolation:**  Transactions should be isolated from each other.  Concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other's balances.
*   **Error Handling:**  Return appropriate error messages for invalid branch IDs, insufficient funds, network partitions, and other potential issues.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:**  Your locking strategy must avoid deadlocks. Consider using lock ordering or timeouts.
*   **Efficiency:**  Optimize for performance.  Minimize the time taken for `Transfer` and `GetBalance` operations, especially under high concurrency.
*   **Scalability:**  Consider how your solution would scale to a large number of branches and concurrent transactions.  While you don't need to implement full horizontal scaling, your design should be mindful of potential bottlenecks.
*   **Network Partition Handling:** The solution must be able to handle network partitions of the branches.

**Specific Error Types:**

Define the following error types:

*   `ErrInvalidBranchID`: Returned when an invalid branch ID is used.
*   `ErrInsufficientFunds`: Returned when a branch has insufficient funds for a transfer.
*   `ErrBranchUnavailable`: Returned when a branch is currently unavailable due to a network partition.
*   `ErrTransactionAborted`: Returned when a transaction is aborted for any other reason (e.g., deadlock).

**Notes:**

*   You can use any concurrency primitives available in Go (e.g., `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, channels).
*   You are not required to implement persistent storage.  Data can be stored in memory.
*   You do not need to handle crash recovery.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, error handling, and data structures. Good luck!

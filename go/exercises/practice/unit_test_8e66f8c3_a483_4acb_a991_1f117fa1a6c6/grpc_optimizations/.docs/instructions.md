## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication with gRPC

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing an efficient inter-service communication layer for a distributed system. The system consists of multiple microservices that need to exchange data frequently.  Due to the high volume of requests and the need for low latency, you've chosen gRPC as the communication protocol.

Each microservice exposes several gRPC endpoints. However, the current implementation suffers from performance bottlenecks due to inefficient data serialization/deserialization and excessive network overhead.

Your goal is to optimize the inter-service communication by implementing a caching mechanism and request batching, while also handling potential errors gracefully.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Caching:** Implement a client-side caching layer for gRPC requests. The cache should store responses based on request parameters (effectively acting as a function memoization). The cache should have a maximum size (number of entries) and use a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy.  The caching layer should be transparent to the service logic, meaning the service code shouldn't need to explicitly check or update the cache.  Consider concurrency issues when accessing the cache from multiple goroutines.

2.  **Request Batching:** Implement a mechanism to batch multiple similar gRPC requests into a single request to reduce network overhead. A request is considered "similar" if it calls the same gRPC method and shares a common prefix in their request parameters (e.g., fetching user profiles for users with IDs "user1", "user2", "user3" could be batched if the method is `GetUserProfile` and the ID prefix is "user"). Batched requests should be processed server-side in a single call and the results then distributed to the individual clients. The batching mechanism should have a maximum batch size and a maximum delay to prevent indefinite waiting.

3.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. If a gRPC call fails (either individually or as part of a batch), the client should receive an appropriate error message. The system should be resilient to transient network errors by implementing retry logic with exponential backoff. You should limit the number of retries.

4.  **Concurrency:** The solution must be thread-safe and able to handle a large number of concurrent requests.

5.  **Efficiency:** Optimize the data serialization and deserialization process. Consider using efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize memory usage and processing time.

6.  **Configuration:** Provide a mechanism to configure the caching behavior (cache size, TTL) and batching behavior (max batch size, max delay, prefix length for batching) without recompiling the code.

**Constraints:**

*   You are free to use any standard Go libraries, but avoid external dependencies unless absolutely necessary (justify their usage).
*   Your solution should be well-documented and easy to understand.
*   Focus on correctness, efficiency, and maintainability.
*   The solution should gracefully handle edge cases, such as empty requests, invalid parameters, and server overload.
*   The gRPC service definition is provided as a `*.proto` file. You should use `protoc` to generate the Go code for the gRPC service and messages.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution produce the correct results for all test cases?
*   Performance: How efficiently does the solution handle a large number of concurrent requests?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand?
*   Error Handling: Does the solution handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages?
*   Testability: Is the solution easy to test?
*   Adherence to Requirements: Does the solution meet all of the specified requirements and constraints?

This problem requires a deep understanding of gRPC, concurrency, caching strategies, and efficient data handling in Go. It also tests your ability to design and implement a robust and scalable system. Good luck!

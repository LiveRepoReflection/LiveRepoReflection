Okay, challenge accepted. Here's a high-difficulty Go coding problem description focusing on graph processing, constrained optimization, and concurrency.

**Project Name:** `DistributedShortestPaths`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a distributed system to efficiently compute shortest paths in a massive, weighted graph.  The graph is too large to fit into the memory of a single machine and is therefore partitioned across multiple worker nodes.

The system consists of a central coordinator and a set of worker nodes. The coordinator receives graph data in chunks (adjacency lists) and distributes it to the workers. Each worker is responsible for storing and processing a subset of the graph. The coordinator also receives shortest path queries (source, destination node pairs) and must orchestrate the workers to compute the shortest path, returning the path's weight.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:**  Each worker node stores a subgraph represented as an adjacency list.  The graph is directed and weighted, with positive edge weights.  Nodes are identified by integer IDs.  The graph is not necessarily complete or connected.

2.  **Data Distribution:** The coordinator distributes the graph data to workers in chunks. Each chunk represents a set of nodes and their outgoing edges (adjacency lists). The coordinator must ensure that each node and its edges are assigned to at least one worker.  A node *can* be present on multiple workers if it is an endpoint of an edge that is handled by the other workers.

3.  **Query Processing:** When the coordinator receives a shortest path query (source, destination), it must:
    *   Identify the worker(s) that contain the source node.
    *   Initiate a distributed shortest path algorithm (e.g., a distributed variant of Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford).
    *   Collect intermediate results from workers.
    *   Determine the shortest path weight.
    *   Return the shortest path weight to the caller. If no path exists, return -1.

4.  **Concurrency:**  The system *must* leverage concurrency for both data distribution and query processing to achieve high throughput.  Use Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) effectively.  Multiple queries might arrive concurrently.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** Implement a basic level of fault tolerance. If a worker fails during query processing, the coordinator should retry the relevant part of the computation on another worker (if available).  The system should not crash completely due to a single worker failure. Assume worker failures are detectable (e.g., via timeouts). The system does not need to recover the failed worker's data - just complete the current query.

6.  **Optimization:**
    *   Minimize network traffic between workers.  Think about how to effectively partition the graph and exchange information.  Avoid unnecessary data transfers.
    *   Workers should use a suitable in-memory data structure (e.g., adjacency list, adjacency matrix, or a more specialized graph data structure) for their subgraph to optimize shortest path computations.
    *   Consider caching strategies at both the coordinator and worker levels to improve performance for repeated queries.  The cache should be implemented with a suitable eviction policy (e.g., LRU).  The cache size should be configurable.

7.  **Scalability:** While a full-scale distributed deployment is not required for the competition, the code should be designed with scalability in mind.  The design should minimize bottlenecks in the coordinator and allow for adding more workers to handle larger graphs.

**Input Format:**

*   **Graph Data:** The coordinator receives graph data as a stream of adjacency lists, where each adjacency list is represented as a string: `"node_id:neighbor1,weight1;neighbor2,weight2;..."`. For example, `"1:2,10;3,5"` represents node 1 having edges to node 2 with weight 10 and to node 3 with weight 5.
*   **Queries:** Queries are provided as `(source_node_id, destination_node_id)` tuples.

**Output Format:**

*   For each query, the system should output the shortest path weight (an integer). If no path exists, output -1.

**Constraints:**

*   Number of nodes: Up to 1,000,000.
*   Number of edges: Up to 10,000,000.
*   Edge weights: Positive integers between 1 and 100.
*   Number of workers: Configurable (e.g., 2-10).
*   Query rate: Up to 100 queries per second.
*   Memory per worker: Limited (e.g., 2GB).  The graph partitioning strategy must ensure that no single worker exceeds this memory limit.
*   Time limit: Solutions must process all queries within a reasonable time (e.g., 5 minutes).

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  The solution must correctly compute shortest path weights for all test cases.
*   **Performance:**  The solution will be evaluated based on its query throughput and average query latency.  Solutions that minimize network traffic and optimize data structures will be favored.
*   **Scalability:**  The design should be scalable and avoid bottlenecks in the coordinator.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  The solution should gracefully handle worker failures without crashing and continue processing queries.
*   **Code Quality:**  The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, distributed systems concepts, concurrency in Go, and optimization techniques. It encourages contestants to think about trade-offs between different approaches and to design a system that is both correct and efficient. Good luck!

Okay, here is a challenging Go programming problem designed with complexity and efficiency in mind.

### Project Name

optimal-meeting-point

### Question Description

Imagine you are developing a smart city application to optimize commuting efficiency. A key feature is to determine the optimal meeting point for a group of people. The city is represented as a weighted, undirected graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent roads connecting them. Each person in the group lives at a specific location (node) in the city.

Given:

*   `n`: The number of locations in the city, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `edges`: A list of edges representing the roads, where each edge is a tuple `(u, v, w)`, where `u` and `v` are the connected locations (nodes) and `w` is the weight (travel time) of the road.
*   `locations`: A list of integers representing the locations (nodes) where each person in the group lives. There can be duplicate locations.

Your Task:

Find the location (node) in the city that minimizes the *maximum* travel time from that location to any of the people's homes. In other words, find the location `meeting_point` such that `max(distance(meeting_point, location))` is minimized for all `location` in `locations`.

Constraints and Requirements:

1.  **Graph Representation:** The input graph can be sparse or dense. The number of locations (`n`) can be large (up to 10^5), and the number of edges can also be substantial (up to 5 * 10^5).
2.  **Edge Weights:** Edge weights (`w`) are positive integers representing travel time and can be up to 10^4.
3.  **Optimization:** Your solution must be efficient in terms of both time and memory. Naive approaches that involve calculating all-pairs shortest paths are unlikely to pass performance tests. Consider using efficient graph algorithms and data structures.
4.  **Disconnected Graph:** The graph might be disconnected. If no meeting point can reach all locations in the `locations` list, return `-1`.
5.  **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If there are multiple locations that minimize the maximum travel time, return the location with the smallest index.
6.  **Locations List Size:** The number of locations in the `locations` list can be up to `n`.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Consider cases where the `locations` list is empty or contains only one element.
8.  **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Solutions with time complexity greater than O(n log n + E) (where E is the number of edges) are unlikely to pass all test cases.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms (like Dijkstra's or similar shortest path algorithms), efficient data structures (like priority queues), and careful handling of edge cases. The optimization requirement makes it particularly challenging. Good luck!

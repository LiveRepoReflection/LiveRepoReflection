## Problem: Optimizing Inter-Datacenter Data Transfers

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a system to efficiently transfer large datasets between geographically distributed datacenters. Each datacenter stores a subset of globally available data. The goal is to minimize the total cost of transferring data to satisfy requests from users located near different datacenters.

**Details:**

1.  **Datacenters:** You are given `n` datacenters. Each datacenter `i` has a unique ID `i` (ranging from 0 to n-1) and a storage capacity `capacity[i]`. Also, each datacenter `i` has an associated cost per unit data transferred `cost[i]`.

2.  **Data Items:** There are `m` unique data items. Each data item `j` has a unique ID `j` (ranging from 0 to m-1) and a size `size[j]`.

3.  **Data Availability:** A matrix `availability[i][j]` represents whether data item `j` is stored in datacenter `i`. It is a boolean matrix: `availability[i][j] = true` if datacenter `i` has data item `j`, and `false` otherwise.

4.  **Requests:** You are given a set of `k` requests. Each request `r` specifies:
    *   `datacenter_id[r]`: The ID of the datacenter where the request originates.
    *   `data_item_id[r]`: The ID of the data item requested.

5.  **Data Transfer:** When a request arrives at a datacenter `i` for data item `j`, if `availability[i][j]` is `true`, the request is immediately satisfied. Otherwise, the data item must be transferred from another datacenter that has the data item.

6.  **Transfer Costs:** The cost of transferring data item `j` from datacenter `source` to datacenter `destination` is `size[j] * cost[source]`.  Note: the cost is based on the *source* datacenter's cost per unit of data. Only a single copy of the data item `j` needs to be transferred to datacenter `i` to satisfy all future requests for that item at datacenter `i`. After the data is transferred to datacenter `i`, `availability[i][j]` becomes `true`.

**Objective:**

Write a function `MinimizeDataTransferCost` that takes the number of datacenters `n`, the number of data items `m`, the `capacity` array, the `cost` array, the `availability` matrix, the number of requests `k`, and the `datacenter_id` and `data_item_id` arrays for the requests as input. The function should return the minimum total cost to satisfy all requests.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `n` <= 100 (Number of datacenters)
*   1 <= `m` <= 500 (Number of data items)
*   1 <= `k` <= 1000 (Number of requests)
*   1 <= `capacity[i]` <= 10<sup>6</sup> for all `i`
*   1 <= `cost[i]` <= 100 for all `i`
*   1 <= `size[j]` <= 10<sup>4</sup> for all `j`
*   The sum of `size` for all `j` at a single data center must not exceed datacenter's `capacity[i]`

**Assumptions:**

*   At least one datacenter will always have the requested data item.
*   You can transfer data from any datacenter to any other datacenter.
*   The `availability` matrix is initially correct.
*   The combined size of data being transferred to a datacenter must not exceed the datacenter's capacity.
*   The problem is solvable, meaning that the requests can always be satisfied without violating capacity constraints.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The solution must be optimized for time complexity. A naive solution that iterates through all possible source datacenters for each request will likely time out. Consider using graph algorithms, dynamic programming, or other optimization techniques to achieve the best possible performance. You should aim for a solution with a time complexity better than O(k * n * m), where k is the number of requests, n is the number of datacenters, and m is the number of data items.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   A request for a data item that is already available at the datacenter.
*   Multiple requests for the same data item at the same datacenter.
*   Datacenters with very low costs.
*   Data items with very large sizes.

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a variety of skills:

**Project Name:** `EfficientRoutePlanner`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient route planner for a delivery service operating in a large city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are locations and edges are roads connecting them. Each road has a associated *cost* (e.g., time, distance, toll fees represented as integer).

The delivery service receives a large number of delivery requests throughout the day. Each request specifies a start location, an end location, and a *deadline* (unix timestamp). The service aims to fulfill as many delivery requests as possible while minimizing the total cost incurred.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The city graph is represented using an adjacency list. The graph can be quite large (up to 10<sup>5</sup> nodes and 10<sup>6</sup> edges). The costs are integers.

2.  **Delivery Requests:** You will be given a stream of delivery requests. Each request has a start location (node ID), an end location (node ID), and a deadline (unix timestamp). The requests arrive online, one at a time.

3.  **Real-time Decision Making:** For *each* incoming delivery request, your program must immediately decide whether to accept or reject it. This decision should be based on whether accepting the request would lead to an overall more efficient schedule.

4.  **Optimization Goal:** The primary goal is to maximize the number of completed deliveries. The secondary goal (in case of ties in the number of deliveries) is to minimize the total cost of all completed deliveries.

5.  **Path Calculation:** You will need to calculate the shortest path (minimum cost path) between the start and end locations for each delivery request.  Consider Dijkstra's algorithm and its variations.

6.  **Deadline Consideration:** If the shortest path between the start and end locations takes longer than the time available until the deadline, the request *must* be rejected.  Assume travel time is proportional to cost.

7.  **Resource Constraints:**  Assume a limited number of delivery vehicles (represented as concurrent processing capability). If all vehicles are currently occupied (i.e., serving other requests), consider the cost of delaying a new request against the potential benefit of accepting it later.  You can model "vehicle occupancy" simply as a fixed number of concurrent processing slots.

8.  **Dynamic Re-evaluation:** Once a request is accepted, it cannot be cancelled. However, your algorithm can dynamically re-evaluate future requests based on the current state of the schedule.

9.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle cases where no path exists between the start and end locations.
    *   Handle cases where the start and end locations are the same.
    *   Handle extremely large graphs and request streams efficiently.

10. **Algorithmic Efficiency:**  The decision-making process for each incoming request must be highly efficient (ideally, on the order of milliseconds). Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to achieve this. Premature optimization is bad, but this constraint is key to the challenge.

11. **Multiple Valid Approaches:** There isn't one single "correct" solution.  Different heuristics, data structures, and optimization strategies will yield different trade-offs between the number of deliveries completed and the total cost. Some approaches could include:

    *   Greedy algorithms with careful tie-breaking.
    *   Lookahead algorithms that consider the potential impact of accepting a request on future requests.
    *   Using heuristics to estimate the "value" of a delivery request based on its deadline and path cost.

Good luck.

Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging, involving graph algorithms, real-world constraints, and optimization.

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient ride-sharing system for a city. The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent roads. Each road (edge) has a travel time associated with it.

You are given a list of ride requests. Each ride request consists of:

*   A start location (node).
*   A destination location (node).
*   A pick-up time (Unix timestamp).
*   A drop-off time limit (Unix timestamp).  This is the latest time the passenger *must* be dropped off.
*   A passenger count (integer).

You have a fleet of ride-sharing vehicles. Each vehicle has:

*   A current location (node).
*   A maximum passenger capacity (integer, same for all vehicles).

Your goal is to maximize the number of ride requests that can be fulfilled by your fleet, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity Constraint:** A vehicle cannot accept a ride if its passenger capacity is exceeded.
2.  **Time Constraint:**  A vehicle *must* pick up the passenger at or after the pick-up time of the request and *must* drop off the passenger at or before the drop-off time limit. The total travel time includes time to travel to the pickup location, then travel from the pickup to the drop-off location.
3.  **Single Ride at a Time:** Each vehicle can only serve one ride request at a time.  It must complete a ride before starting a new one.
4.  **Instantaneous Pickup/Drop-off:** The pickup and drop-off processes are instantaneous (take no time).

Write a function that takes the following inputs:

*   `cityGraph`: A directed graph represented as an adjacency list, where keys are node IDs (integers) and values are a list of outgoing edges. Each edge is a struct containing the destination node ID (integer) and travel time (integer).
*   `rideRequests`: A slice of structs, each representing a ride request as described above.
*   `vehicles`: A slice of structs, each representing a vehicle as described above.
*   `maxPassengerCapacity`: An integer representing the maximum passenger capacity of each vehicle.

Your function should return:

*   A slice of structs, where each struct represents a ride assignment. This struct should contain the `rideRequest` index in the `rideRequests` input array and the `vehicle` index in the `vehicles` input array.
*   An integer representing the number of fulfilled rides.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should strive to maximize the number of fulfilled ride requests. There might be multiple valid solutions that fulfill the same number of rides, but your solution should be efficient in finding *a* good solution.  Consider the scale of a real-world city with thousands of locations and requests.
*   The solution should be performant.  Inefficient graph traversals or naive assignment algorithms will likely time out on larger test cases.

**Edge Cases and Constraints:**

*   The graph can be disconnected.
*   There may be no path between the start and destination for some ride requests, or between a vehicle's current location and the ride request's start location.
*   Ride requests may overlap in time and/or location.
*   The number of ride requests and vehicles can be large (up to thousands).
*   Travel times are positive integers.
*   Pick-up times and drop-off time limits are valid Unix timestamps (positive integers).  The drop-off time limit will always be greater than or equal to the pick-up time.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal (finding shortest paths), algorithm design (ride assignment), and optimization techniques to handle realistic constraints and scale. Good luck!

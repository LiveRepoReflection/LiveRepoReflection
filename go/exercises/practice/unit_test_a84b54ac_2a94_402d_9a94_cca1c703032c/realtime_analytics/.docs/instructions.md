Okay, here's a challenging Go programming problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

### Project Name

`ScalableAnalytics`

### Question Description

You are building a scalable analytics service that processes large volumes of user activity data.  The service receives a continuous stream of events, each representing a user action on a website.  Your task is to design and implement a system that efficiently calculates and maintains real-time aggregates of these events.

Specifically, you need to support the following:

1.  **Event Ingestion:** The service receives events as JSON objects. Each event has the following structure:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user123",   // String representing the user's ID
  "event_type": "click",  // String representing the type of event (e.g., "click", "page_view", "purchase")
  "timestamp": 1678886400, // Integer representing the Unix timestamp of the event (seconds since epoch)
  "attributes": {         // Optional object containing event-specific attributes
    "item_id": "item456",  // Example attribute: ID of the item clicked
    "value": 10.5          // Example attribute: Value associated with the event
  }
}
```

2.  **Aggregate Calculation:** The service must calculate the following aggregate metrics in real-time:

    *   **Total Events:** The total number of events received.
    *   **Events per User:**  The number of events per unique user.
    *   **Events per Event Type:** The number of events for each `event_type`.
    *   **Sum of Attribute Values per User and Event Type:**  For each user and `event_type`, calculate the sum of the `value` attribute (if present).  If the `value` attribute is not a number, it should be ignored for this aggregation.

3.  **Querying Aggregates:**  The service must provide an API to query these aggregates. The API should allow querying:

    *   The total number of events.
    *   The number of events for a specific user.
    *   The number of events for a specific event type.
    *   The sum of `value` attributes for a specific user and event type.

4.  **Scalability and Efficiency:** The service must be designed to handle a high volume of events (millions per second) with low latency for both event ingestion and query processing.  Consider concurrency, data structures, and algorithms that minimize resource usage and maximize throughput.

5.  **Concurrency:**  The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent event ingestion and query requests without data races or inconsistencies.

6.  **Memory Constraints:**  The service should be memory-efficient.  Consider using appropriate data structures and techniques to avoid excessive memory consumption, especially when dealing with a large number of users and event types.  Assume that the number of unique `user_id` values and `event_type` values could grow very large.

7.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.  The service should gracefully handle invalid JSON events, missing or incorrect attributes, and other potential errors without crashing or losing data. Errors should be logged.

8. **Time window constraints:** Data need to be aggregated based on the time window of the last 60 seconds. Any data that is older than 60 seconds needs to be removed from the current aggregation.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement the solution in Go.
*   Your solution should be well-structured, modular, and easy to understand.
*   Provide clear and concise code comments.
*   Prioritize correctness, scalability, and efficiency.
*   Consider the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms.
*   Demonstrate your understanding of concurrency and memory management in Go.

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures (maps, potentially specialized data structures for real-time aggregation), concurrency (goroutines, mutexes, channels), algorithm design (efficient lookups, updates), and system design principles (scalability, error handling). It's a challenging problem that requires careful planning and implementation. Good luck!

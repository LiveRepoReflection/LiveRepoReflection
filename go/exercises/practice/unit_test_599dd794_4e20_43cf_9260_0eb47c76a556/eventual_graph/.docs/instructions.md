`Eventual Consistency Graph`

## Question Description

You are building a distributed system where data is replicated across multiple nodes for fault tolerance and scalability.  Updates to the data must eventually propagate to all nodes, achieving eventual consistency. The data is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between entities.  Each node holds a version number, which increments with every update to the node's data.

Your task is to implement a system that efficiently propagates updates throughout the graph, ensuring that all nodes eventually converge to the latest versions of the data. However, bandwidth is limited, and sending the entire graph state on every update is not feasible. You need to intelligently determine which updates to send to which nodes to minimize network traffic while guaranteeing eventual consistency.

Specifically, implement the following:

1.  **Data Structure:** Represent the graph as a `map[string]Node`, where the key is the node ID (string) and `Node` is a struct with `ID`, `Version`, and `Data` fields. The `Data` field can be a simple string.

2.  **Update Propagation:** Implement a function `PropagateUpdates(graph map[string]Node, sourceNodeID string, targetNodeID string, maxNodesToSend int) error`.  This function simulates sending updates from a source node to a target node.

    *   The function should compare the version of the source node with the version of the target node.
    *   If the source node's version is higher than the target node's version, the function should send the update. The update consists of the source node's ID, its version, and its data.
    *   If the source node's version is the same or lower than the target node's version, no update is necessary.
    *   The challenge comes in optimizing this process. The function should *also* recursively check the source node's *neighbors* (nodes that have edges pointing *to* the source node). If any of these neighbors have a newer version than the target node, *they* should also be sent, up to a maximum of `maxNodesToSend` total nodes sent (including the original source node). The neighbors are determined based on the graph structure, which you must implement in a separate function.
    *   The updates should be applied to the target node (if it exists in the graph) and its neighbors (if sent).
    *   Consider using a queue or similar structure to manage the neighbors to visit.
    *   The function should return `nil` on success and an error if, for instance, the source or target node ID is invalid or if the update process exceeds a reasonable time limit (e.g., to prevent infinite loops).

3.  **Neighbor Discovery:** Implement a function `FindNeighbors(graph map[string]Node, nodeID string) []string`. This function should return a slice of node IDs that have edges pointing *to* the specified `nodeID`. You will need to devise a way to efficiently store edge information to make this function efficient.  Consider using an adjacency list or similar representation.

4.  **Cycle Detection:** The graph might contain cycles.  Ensure that your update propagation logic doesn't get stuck in infinite loops.  Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent cycles during the neighbor traversal.

5.  **Optimization:**  Minimize the number of nodes sent during propagation. For instance, if the target node is already up-to-date, avoid propagating updates from its neighbors. Similarly, avoid sending duplicate nodes.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Graph Size:** The graph can contain a large number of nodes (up to 100,000).
*   **Concurrency:**  Assume that multiple update propagation requests can occur concurrently. Ensure your solution is thread-safe using appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) to protect the graph data structure.
*   **Efficiency:** The `PropagateUpdates` function must be efficient to avoid excessive network traffic. Aim for a solution with a time complexity that scales reasonably with the number of nodes and edges in the relevant subgraph.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to deal with invalid node IDs, network errors (simulated), and potential infinite loops.
*   **Eventual Consistency Guarantee:** The core requirement is to ensure that all nodes eventually converge to the latest data. The solution must guarantee this property.

This problem requires you to combine graph algorithms, data structures, concurrency, and optimization techniques to build a robust and efficient eventual consistency system. It tests your ability to design and implement a complex system that can handle large-scale data and concurrent operations while adhering to strict consistency requirements.

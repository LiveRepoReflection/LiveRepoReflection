Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Go coding problem:

**Problem Title:** Time-Based Key-Value Store with Eviction

**Problem Description:**

Design a time-based key-value store that supports the following operations:

1.  **`Set(key string, value string, timestamp int)`:** Stores the given `key` and `value`, along with the `timestamp`.  Multiple values can be stored for the same key with different timestamps.

2.  **`Get(key string, timestamp int) string`:** Retrieves the value associated with the given `key` for the largest `timestamp` that is *less than or equal to* the given `timestamp`. If no such value exists (either the key doesn't exist or no timestamped value is less than or equal to the given timestamp), return an empty string `""`.

3.  **`Count(key string, startTimestamp int, endTimestamp int) int`:** Returns the number of values associated with the given `key` whose timestamps fall within the inclusive range `[startTimestamp, endTimestamp]`.

4.  **`Evict(maxSize int)`:**  Limits the total memory usage of the store. If the memory usage (calculated as the sum of the lengths of all stored `key` and `value` strings) exceeds `maxSize`, evict entries (key-value pairs and their timestamps) until the memory usage is at or below `maxSize`.  Eviction should prioritize entries with the *oldest* timestamps across *all* keys. You can assume the timestamps are unique.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   The key and value are strings.
*   Timestamps are integers representing seconds since the epoch. Timestamps are strictly increasing for each key.  That is, for a given key, if you call `Set` multiple times, the timestamps will always be in ascending order.
*   The store must be highly efficient for both reads (`Get` and `Count`) and writes (`Set`).  Consider the time complexity of your data structures and algorithms.
*   The `Evict` operation must be implemented efficiently, especially when the store contains a large number of entries.
*   The memory usage calculation should be accurate (the sum of lengths of the strings, not just an approximation).
*   The `Evict` operation should remove *entire* key-value-timestamp entries (i.e., you can't partially remove a value to reduce memory usage; you must remove the whole (key, value, timestamp) tuple).
*   The store needs to be thread-safe. Multiple goroutines might access the store concurrently.
*   Assume `maxSize` is always greater than 0.

**Example:**

```go
store := NewTimeMap() // Assuming you create a constructor called NewTimeMap()

store.Set("foo", "bar", 1)
store.Set("foo", "bar2", 4)
store.Set("baz", "qux", 2)
store.Set("baz", "quux", 5)

fmt.Println(store.Get("foo", 3))  // Output: bar
fmt.Println(store.Get("foo", 5))  // Output: bar2
fmt.Println(store.Get("foo", 0))  // Output: ""
fmt.Println(store.Get("bar", 5))  // Output: ""

fmt.Println(store.Count("foo", 2, 4)) // Output: 1 (only "bar2" at timestamp 4)
fmt.Println(store.Count("baz", 1, 5)) // Output: 2 ("qux" at 2, "quux" at 5)

store.Evict(20) //Assuming "foo", "bar", "bar2", "baz", "qux", "quux" each are 3 chars long and keys "foo" and "baz" too. Total chars: 3*6+3*2 = 24

fmt.Println(store.Get("foo", 4))  // Might Output: "" (depending on eviction strategy)
fmt.Println(store.Get("baz", 5))  // Might Output: "" (depending on eviction strategy)
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The code must produce the correct results for all valid inputs.
*   **Efficiency:** The code should be optimized for both time and space complexity.
*   **Memory Usage:** The code should adhere to the memory limit imposed by the `Evict` operation.
*   **Concurrency:** The code must be thread-safe and handle concurrent access correctly.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a combination of data structure knowledge (choosing the right structures for efficient storage and retrieval), algorithmic thinking (designing the `Evict` operation), and concurrency control (ensuring thread safety). Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques.

**Project Name:** `EventHorizon`

**Question Description:**

Imagine a distributed system that processes a stream of events. Each event has a timestamp (nanoseconds since the Unix epoch, represented as `int64`), a unique event ID (a UUID string), a priority (an integer), and a payload (a string).

Your task is to implement a service that efficiently manages and retrieves these events, simulating a real-time event processing pipeline.  The service should support the following operations:

1.  **Ingest Event:** Accepts a new event and stores it in the system.  Events arrive in an arbitrary order (not necessarily sorted by timestamp or priority).

2.  **Query by Timestamp Range:** Given a start and end timestamp (inclusive), return all events within that range, sorted by priority (highest priority first). Events with the same priority should be sorted by timestamp (earliest first).

3.  **Query by Event ID:** Given an event ID, return the event if it exists.

4.  **Delete by Timestamp Range:** Given a start and end timestamp (inclusive), delete all events within that range. The events do not need to be returned.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scale:** The system must be able to handle a large number of events (millions or billions).
*   **Performance:** Ingest and query operations must be highly performant.  Optimize for both time and space complexity.  Query operations should return results as quickly as possible.
*   **Concurrency:** The service must be thread-safe and handle concurrent ingest and query requests without data corruption or race conditions.
*   **Timestamp Granularity:** Timestamps are in nanoseconds, so consider the potential for a high volume of events with the same timestamp.
*   **Memory Usage:** Minimize memory footprint. Avoid loading the entire dataset into memory for range queries.
*   **Immutability:** Assume event payloads are immutable.
*   **Error Handling:** Return appropriate errors for invalid inputs or internal system failures.
*   **Duplicate Event IDs:**  If an event with the same ID already exists, overwrite the existing event with the new event.
*   **Zero Event Handling:** You should gracefully handle scenarios where there are no events within the given timestamp range. Return an empty slice in this case.

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Structures:**  Carefully choose appropriate data structures to efficiently store and retrieve events based on timestamps, IDs, and priorities. Consider using a combination of data structures. For example, you might use a tree-based structure for timestamp-based queries and a hash map for ID-based queries.
*   **Indexing:** Implement indexing strategies to speed up query operations.  Consider the trade-offs between index size and query performance.
*   **Concurrency Control:**  Use appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, read-write mutexes) to ensure thread safety.  Minimize lock contention to maximize concurrency.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Select efficient algorithms for sorting and searching.  Consider the characteristics of the event data (e.g., distribution of timestamps and priorities) when choosing algorithms.

This problem is designed to be open-ended and allow for multiple valid approaches. The optimal solution will depend on the specific trade-offs made between memory usage, query performance, and concurrency. Good luck!

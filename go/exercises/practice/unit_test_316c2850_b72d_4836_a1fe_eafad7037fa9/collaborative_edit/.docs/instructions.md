## Question: Decentralized Collaborative Editing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a system for decentralized collaborative editing of a large document. Imagine a Google Docs but built on a distributed ledger. Multiple users can concurrently make edits to different sections of the document. Your system must ensure consistency, eventual consistency (all nodes converge to the same state), and resistance to malicious actors.

The core of the system is a distributed ledger that stores all edits. Each edit is represented as an "Operation". An Operation contains the following:

*   `author_id`: A unique identifier for the user who made the edit (string).
*   `timestamp`: The time when the edit was created (nanoseconds since epoch, int64).
*   `section_id`: The ID of the section of the document being edited (string).  Think of sections like paragraphs.
*   `operation_type`: Type of operation, supporting "insert", "delete", "replace" (string).
*   `content`: The text being inserted, deleted, or used as replacement content (string).
*   `version`: A version number for the section (int64). Each successful operation on a section increments its version.

Your task is to implement a function, `ApplyOperations`, that takes the current state of the document (a map of section IDs to their content) and a sorted list of `Operation`s as input. The operations are sorted by timestamp. The function should return the updated state of the document.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

1.  **Conflict Resolution:**  If multiple operations target the same `section_id` but have mismatched `version` numbers relative to the section's current version, the operation should be rejected (ignored).  Rejection should be silent; the function should simply proceed to the next operation. The 'version' field in the Operation is the version it expects to be working on.

2.  **Timestamp Ordering:** The input `Operation` list is guaranteed to be sorted by `timestamp`.  However, timestamps may not be perfectly unique. If two operations have the same timestamp and target the same `section_id`, apply them in the order they appear in the list.

3.  **Malicious Actors:** A malicious actor might try to revert the document to an earlier version by submitting an operation with an old `version` number. Your system must correctly reject such operations.

4.  **Large Document:** The document can be very large (millions of sections).  Your solution must be memory-efficient. Consider using in-place updates where possible, instead of creating copies of large strings.

5.  **Concurrency:** Multiple users can submit operations concurrently. Your implementation must ensure that operations are applied in a consistent manner (based on the timestamp).

6.  **Operation Types:**

    *   **"insert"**: Inserts `content` at the end of the section.
    *   **"delete"**: Deletes the entire section and replace with `content` if `content` is not empty, or delete the section entirely if `content` is empty.
    *   **"replace"**: Replaces the entire content of the section with `content`.

7.  **Empty Sections:** If a section is deleted (either by a "delete" operation with empty content or by other reasons), it should remain in the document state as an empty string ("").

8.  **Initial State:** The initial state of the document might contain empty sections.

**Input:**

*   `document_state`:  `map[string]string` - A map representing the current state of the document.  Keys are `section_id`s, and values are the content of those sections.
*   `operations`:  `[]Operation` - A sorted list of `Operation`s to apply to the document.

**Output:**

*   `map[string]string` - The updated `document_state` after applying the operations.

**Go Definition:**

```go
package main

type Operation struct {
	AuthorID      string
	Timestamp     int64
	SectionID     string
	OperationType string
	Content       string
	Version       int64
}

func ApplyOperations(documentState map[string]string, operations []Operation) map[string]string {
	// Your code here
	return documentState
}
```

**Example:**

```go
initialState := map[string]string{
	"section1": "Hello",
	"section2": "World",
}

operations := []Operation{
	{
		AuthorID:      "user1",
		Timestamp:     1,
		SectionID:     "section1",
		OperationType: "insert",
		Content:       ", user1!",
		Version:       0,
	},
	{
		AuthorID:      "user2",
		Timestamp:     2,
		SectionID:     "section2",
		OperationType: "replace",
		Content:       "Universe",
		Version:       0,
	},
	{
		AuthorID:      "user3",
		Timestamp:     3,
		SectionID:     "section1",
		OperationType: "replace",
		Content:       "Goodbye",
		Version:       1,
	},
}

updatedState := ApplyOperations(initialState, operations)

// Expected updatedState:
// {
//  "section1": "Goodbye",
//  "section2": "Universe",
// }
```

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, concurrency, and error handling to ensure a robust and consistent collaborative editing system. Good luck!

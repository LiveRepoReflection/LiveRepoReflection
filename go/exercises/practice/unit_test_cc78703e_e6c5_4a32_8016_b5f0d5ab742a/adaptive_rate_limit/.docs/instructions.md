## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service that protects backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. The rate limiter should operate across multiple instances and dynamically adjust rate limits based on the observed performance and health of the backend services. This is a practical system design problem that tests your ability to handle concurrency, distribution, and dynamic configuration.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must function correctly and consistently across multiple instances (e.g., running behind a load balancer). Requests originating from the same client (identified by a unique key, such as IP address or user ID) should be rate-limited consistently regardless of which rate limiter instance handles the request.

2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:**  The rate limit for each client key should be configurable (requests per second, requests per minute, etc.). The system should allow for different rate limits for different client segments (e.g., free users vs. premium users).

3.  **Adaptive Throttling:** The rate limiter should *dynamically* adjust the rate limits based on the observed performance of the backend services. If the backend services are experiencing high latency or errors, the rate limiter should *reduce* the rate limits to protect them from further overload. Conversely, if the backend services are performing well, the rate limiter should gradually *increase* the rate limits to maximize throughput.

4.  **Concurrency Safety:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests efficiently.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be resilient to failures of individual rate limiter instances or components of the distributed data store.

**Advanced Considerations & Constraints:**

*   **Data Storage:** You are free to choose a suitable distributed data store for storing rate limit counters and configuration. Consider the trade-offs between different storage options (e.g., Redis, Memcached, Cassandra, etcd) in terms of performance, consistency, and scalability. The amount of memory used should scale linearly with the number of unique IPs to avoid memory exhaustion.
*   **Rate Limiting Algorithms:** Implement the rate limiting logic using a suitable algorithm. Common algorithms include:
    *   Token Bucket
    *   Leaky Bucket
    *   Fixed Window Counter
    *   Sliding Window Log
    *   Sliding Window Counter

    Consider the trade-offs between these algorithms in terms of accuracy, performance, and implementation complexity.
*   **Backend Health Monitoring:** Implement a mechanism for monitoring the health and performance of the backend services. This could involve periodically polling metrics from the backend services (e.g., latency, error rate) or subscribing to a stream of events indicating service health status.  The adaptive throttling logic should react to these health signals.
*   **Configuration Updates:** The rate limiter should support dynamic updates to the rate limit configurations without requiring a restart. This could involve implementing a configuration server or using a distributed configuration store (e.g., etcd, Consul).
*   **Minimizing Latency:** The rate limiter should introduce minimal latency to the request processing pipeline. Optimize the code for performance and choose data structures and algorithms that provide fast lookup and update operations.
*   **Scalability:** The rate limiter architecture should be designed to scale horizontally to handle a large number of requests per second.
*   **Consistency:**  While perfect consistency might be difficult to achieve in a distributed system, strive for eventual consistency in the rate limit counters. Consider the implications of data staleness and implement appropriate strategies for handling inconsistencies.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases such as:
    *   Sudden spikes in traffic from a specific client.
    *   Failures of the backend health monitoring system.
    *   Network partitions between rate limiter instances and the data store.
    *   Clock skew between rate limiter instances.
*   **Optimization:** The solution should be optimized for both memory usage and performance. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize memory footprint and maximize throughput.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The rate limiter should accurately enforce the configured rate limits.
*   Performance: The rate limiter should introduce minimal latency and handle a high volume of requests.
*   Scalability: The rate limiter architecture should be scalable and able to handle a large number of clients and requests.
*   Fault Tolerance: The rate limiter should be resilient to failures of individual instances and components.
*   Adaptive Throttling: The rate limiter should dynamically adjust the rate limits based on the observed performance of the backend services.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   System Design: The overall system design should be sound and address the challenges of distributed rate limiting.

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, distributed systems, and system design principles. It challenges the solver to make informed decisions about the choice of data structures, algorithms, and technologies to meet the performance, scalability, and reliability requirements. Good luck!

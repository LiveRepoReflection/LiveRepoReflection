Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging in Go, incorporating elements you requested:

**Project Name:** `ScalableMessageQueue`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly scalable and reliable message queue system in Go. This system will handle a large volume of messages, distributed across multiple producers and consumers. The core requirements are:

1.  **Message Persistence:** Messages must be persisted to disk (consider using append-only logs for efficiency and durability). The system should be able to recover from crashes without losing messages.

2.  **Message Ordering:** For each producer, messages must be delivered to consumers in the order they were produced. However, there is no global ordering requirement across all producers.

3.  **Multiple Consumers:** Messages should be delivered to multiple consumer groups (publish-subscribe pattern). Each consumer group receives a copy of all messages.

4.  **At-Least-Once Delivery:**  Ensure that all messages are delivered to consumers at least once.  Consumers must acknowledge (ACK) messages upon successful processing. If a consumer fails to ACK a message within a configurable timeout, the message should be redelivered to another consumer in the same group.

5.  **Scalability:** The system should be horizontally scalable. You should be able to add more message queue nodes to handle increased load. You don't need to implement the distributed coordination part, just explain how it would be implemented.

6.  **Concurrency and Locking:**  The message queue must handle concurrent producers and consumers efficiently. Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. However, avoid excessive locking that could lead to performance bottlenecks.

7.  **Message Routing (Optional):** Implement a simple message routing mechanism where messages can be routed to specific consumer groups based on a predefined routing key (e.g., using a hash of the message ID).

8.  **Configuration:** The system should be configurable, allowing users to specify:
    *   The directory for message persistence.
    *   The ACK timeout.
    *   The number of consumer groups.
    *   The number of queue nodes (for scalability discussion).

**Constraints:**

*   **Limited Memory:**  Design the system to handle a large volume of messages without exceeding reasonable memory limits.  Disk persistence is key.
*   **High Throughput:** Optimize for high message throughput.  Consider buffering, batching, and asynchronous operations where appropriate.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   **Clear API:**  Design a clean and easy-to-use API for producers and consumers.

**Expected Solution:**

Your solution should include:

*   Well-documented Go code implementing the message queue.
*   A description of the system architecture, including data structures used and concurrency model.
*   A discussion of the trade-offs made in the design.
*   A discussion of how the system can be scaled horizontally.
*   An explanation of how distributed coordination (e.g., using etcd or Raft) would be used to manage the cluster of message queue nodes, handle leader election, and ensure consistency.
*   Considerations for how to handle message deletion / retention policies.
*   Analysis of time complexity of key operations (enqueue, dequeue, acknowledge).

This question challenges the solver to think about real-world distributed system design, forcing them to balance performance, reliability, and scalability concerns. It also tests their knowledge of Go concurrency primitives, data structures, and file I/O.  The scalability and distributed coordination aspects add a significant layer of complexity, making it a hard-level problem.

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focusing on system design aspects and algorithmic efficiency.

### Project Name

`ConsistentHashingRing`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a scalable and fault-tolerant distributed key-value store. A core component of such a system is a consistent hashing ring, responsible for distributing keys across multiple server nodes.

Implement a `ConsistentHashingRing` in Go that supports the following operations:

1.  **`AddNode(nodeID string)`**: Adds a new node to the ring. The `nodeID` is a unique identifier for the node. The addition must correctly assign keys to the new node, potentially rebalancing the key distribution.

2.  **`RemoveNode(nodeID string)`**: Removes a node from the ring. The removal must gracefully redistribute the keys previously assigned to the removed node to the remaining nodes.

3.  **`GetNode(key string)`**: Given a key, return the `nodeID` of the node responsible for storing that key. The key distribution must be consistent â€“ the same key should always map to the same node unless the ring's topology (nodes) changes.

4.  **`ListNodes()`**: Returns a sorted slice of node IDs currently in the ring. Sorted in lexicographical order.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Consistent Hashing:** Implement consistent hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm or a similar hashing function. The hashing function should map keys and node IDs to a uniform distribution on a ring.
*   **Virtual Nodes (Replicas):** To improve key distribution and fault tolerance, use virtual nodes (replicas). Each physical node should be represented by multiple virtual nodes on the ring. The number of virtual nodes per physical node should be configurable during ring initialization.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  The system should remain functional when nodes are added or removed. Key ownership should be transferred smoothly during these operations.
*   **Scalability:** The ring should be able to handle a large number of nodes (e.g., hundreds or thousands) and a high volume of key lookups.  Performance must be considered.
*   **Concurrency:**  The `AddNode`, `RemoveNode`, and `GetNode` operations must be thread-safe. Multiple goroutines should be able to access the ring concurrently without data races or inconsistencies.
*   **Key Distribution:** Strive for a relatively even distribution of keys across nodes. Virtual nodes should help mitigate skew.
*   **Hashing Ring Size:**  Assume the hashing ring size (the maximum possible hash value) is 2^32 (uint32).

**Implementation Details:**

*   The `ConsistentHashingRing` struct should store the ring's state (nodes, virtual nodes, hash mappings).
*   Use a suitable data structure (e.g., a sorted map or tree) to efficiently locate the responsible node for a given key.
*   The hashing function should take a string (key or node ID) as input and return a uint32 hash value.
*   Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., empty ring, invalid node ID).

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Minimize the computational cost of the `GetNode` operation.
*   Optimize the rebalancing process when nodes are added or removed to avoid excessive data migration.
*   Consider the memory footprint of the ring, especially with a large number of nodes and virtual nodes.

**Example Usage:**

```go
ring := NewConsistentHashingRing(10) // 10 virtual nodes per physical node
ring.AddNode("node1")
ring.AddNode("node2")
ring.AddNode("node3")

node := ring.GetNode("mykey") // Returns "node1", "node2", or "node3" based on the key's hash
fmt.Println("Key 'mykey' belongs to:", node)

ring.RemoveNode("node2")
node = ring.GetNode("mykey") // Might now return "node1" or "node3"
fmt.Println("Key 'mykey' now belongs to:", node)

nodes := ring.ListNodes()
fmt.Println("Current nodes:", nodes) // Should print a sorted list of remaining node IDs
```

This problem requires a solid understanding of consistent hashing, data structures, concurrency, and optimization techniques. It also necessitates careful consideration of system design principles to build a robust and scalable solution. Good luck!

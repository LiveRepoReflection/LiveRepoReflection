Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be on par with a LeetCode hard difficulty question.

## Problem: Asynchronous Rate Limiter with Priority Queue

### Question Description

Design and implement a highly performant, asynchronous rate limiter with a priority queue in Go. This rate limiter should control the rate at which tasks are executed, ensuring that the system isn't overwhelmed. The rate limiter needs to handle a large number of concurrent requests, each with an associated priority.

**Functionality:**

The rate limiter should provide the following core functionality:

1.  **`Submit(task func(), priority int)`:**  Accepts a task (a function with no arguments and no return value) and a priority (lower integer values represent higher priority). Tasks should be added to a priority queue.

2.  **Rate Limiting:** The rate limiter should execute tasks from the priority queue at a configurable rate (tasks per second).

3.  **Asynchronous Execution:** The `Submit` function must be non-blocking. Task submission should be fast, and the actual task execution should happen asynchronously.

4.  **Priority Handling:**  Tasks with higher priority (lower integer values) should be executed before tasks with lower priority.  If multiple tasks have the same priority, they should be executed in FIFO (First-In, First-Out) order.

5.  **Graceful Shutdown:**  Provide a mechanism to gracefully shut down the rate limiter, ensuring that all enqueued tasks are eventually executed (or a configurable timeout is reached).  The rate limiter should not accept new tasks after shutdown is initiated.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be able to handle a large number of concurrent calls to `Submit` without significant performance degradation.
*   **Efficiency:**  The priority queue implementation should be efficient, minimizing the time it takes to enqueue and dequeue tasks.  Consider the trade-offs between different priority queue implementations (e.g., heap-based, tree-based).
*   **Scalability:**  The rate limiter should be designed to be scalable and handle a growing number of tasks and concurrent users.
*   **Accuracy:** The rate limiter should enforce the configured rate limit as accurately as possible, even under high load.  Allow for a small degree of tolerance (e.g., a few milliseconds variance).
*   **Atomicity:**  Ensure that all operations on shared data structures (e.g., the priority queue, counters) are performed atomically to prevent race conditions.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle potential errors gracefully, such as invalid priority values or failures during task execution.
*   **Configuration:** The rate limit (tasks per second) should be configurable at initialization.
*   **Memory Management:**  Avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient memory usage, especially with a large number of enqueued tasks.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:**  Implement the rate limiter in a way that avoids deadlocks.
*   **Timeout:** The Graceful Shutdown functionality should support timeout, in case the tasks are not finished in time.

**Input:**

The input to your program will be a series of calls to the `Submit` function with different tasks and priorities.  You will also need to handle shutdown signals (e.g., from a command-line argument or an operating system signal).

**Output:**

There is no explicit output to standard output required. The success of your solution will be measured by its ability to handle a large number of tasks concurrently, maintain the configured rate limit accurately, prioritize tasks correctly, and shut down gracefully within the given resource constraints (CPU, memory, time).

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a web server handling incoming requests. Each request can be treated as a task. Higher priority requests (e.g., those from authenticated users) should be processed before lower priority requests (e.g., those from anonymous users). The rate limiter ensures that the server isn't overwhelmed by a sudden surge of requests, while still prioritizing important tasks.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a heap-based priority queue for efficient priority handling.
*   Use channels and goroutines for asynchronous task execution and communication.
*   Use mutexes or atomic operations to protect shared data structures from race conditions.
*   Use `time.Sleep` or `time.Ticker` to control the rate of task execution.
*   Think carefully about how to handle shutdown signals and ensure graceful termination.
*   Consider the use of buffered channels to avoid blocking on task submission.

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, data structures, and algorithms in Go. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focusing on Go.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, each uniquely identified by an integer from `0` to `N-1`. Connections between nodes are represented by a set of unidirectional edges, each with a specific latency. The network topology can be sparse or dense, and may contain cycles.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology, a source node `S`, a destination node `D`, and a maximum allowed latency `L`, finds the *minimum* number of hops required to reach `D` from `S` within the latency constraint `L`.

**Input:**

*   `N` (int): The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 100,000).
*   `edges` ([][]int): A 2D slice representing the network's edges. Each inner slice `[u, v, latency]` represents a unidirectional edge from node `u` to node `v` with the given `latency` (0 <= u, v < N, 0 <= latency <= 100).  There can be multiple edges between any two nodes.
*   `S` (int): The source node (0 <= S < N).
*   `D` (int): The destination node (0 <= D < N).
*   `L` (int): The maximum allowed latency for the path (0 <= L <= 1,000,000).

**Output:**

*   (int): The minimum number of hops required to reach `D` from `S` with a total latency no greater than `L`. If no such path exists, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Large Network:** The network can be large (up to 100,000 nodes).  Your solution must be efficient in terms of both time and memory.
2.  **Unidirectional Edges:**  Edges are unidirectional. A connection from `u` to `v` does not imply a connection from `v` to `u`.
3.  **Latency Constraint:** The total latency of the path from `S` to `D` must be less than or equal to `L`.
4.  **Minimum Hops:** You must find the path with the *fewest* number of hops that satisfies the latency constraint.  A path with lower latency but more hops is not acceptable.
5.  **Cycles:** The network may contain cycles. Your algorithm must handle cycles correctly without entering infinite loops.
6.  **Disconnected Graph:** The graph might be disconnected. If the destination node is not reachable from the source node, the function should return `-1`.
7.  **Multiple Edges:** There can be multiple parallel edges between any two nodes, with potentially different latencies. You must consider all possible paths.
8.  **Optimization:**  Solutions that perform exhaustive searches or have high time complexity (e.g., O(N^3) or worse) will likely time out on larger test cases.  Efficient algorithms are required.
9.  **Edge Case: S == D:** If the source and destination are the same node, the minimum hops is 0 if latency 0 is within limit L, otherwise -1.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, optimization techniques, and careful handling of edge cases. The optimal solution will likely involve a modified version of shortest path algorithms, optimized for the hop count metric under a latency constraint. Good luck!

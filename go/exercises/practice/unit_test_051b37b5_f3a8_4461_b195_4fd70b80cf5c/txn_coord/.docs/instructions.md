Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition, leaning towards the "Hard" difficulty:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, distributed transaction coordinator (similar to a 2-Phase Commit protocol) for a system managing financial transactions across multiple independent bank services (databases). Each bank service is responsible for managing accounts and funds for a specific region. A single transaction may involve transferring funds between accounts residing in *different* bank services.

Your coordinator must ensure atomicity: either *all* the changes within a distributed transaction are committed across all participating bank services, or *none* of them are.  This means that if any bank service fails to prepare or commit, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all services.

**System Architecture:**

You will simulate the bank services. Each service exposes a simple API (using Go interfaces) to prepare, commit, and rollback transactions. Your coordinator will interact with these services to manage distributed transactions.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction ID Generation:** Your coordinator should generate unique transaction IDs for each new distributed transaction initiated.

2.  **Prepare Phase:** The coordinator must send a "prepare" request to all participating bank services *concurrently*. Each service will attempt to tentatively apply the transaction's changes. If a service can prepare successfully, it should respond with an "ACK" (acknowledgement). If a service cannot prepare (e.g., due to insufficient funds, database error), it should respond with a "NACK" (negative acknowledgement) including a reason for the failure.

3.  **Commit/Rollback Decision:**
    *   If *all* bank services respond with "ACK" during the prepare phase, the coordinator proceeds to the commit phase.
    *   If *any* bank service responds with "NACK" during the prepare phase, or if the coordinator doesn't receive a response from a service within a specified timeout, the coordinator proceeds to the rollback phase.

4.  **Commit Phase:** The coordinator sends a "commit" request to all participating bank services *concurrently*.  Each service permanently applies the tentatively applied changes.

5.  **Rollback Phase:** The coordinator sends a "rollback" request to all participating bank services *concurrently*. Each service reverts any tentative changes made during the prepare phase.

6.  **Concurrency and Deadlock Avoidance:** Your coordinator must handle multiple concurrent transactions safely.  Pay close attention to potential deadlocks and implement appropriate mechanisms to prevent them (e.g., using timeouts, ordering resources).

7.  **Timeout Handling:** Implement timeouts for prepare, commit, and rollback phases.  If a bank service doesn't respond within the timeout, consider the operation failed and proceed accordingly (rollback if in prepare, retry or mark as failed if in commit/rollback).  The timeout values should be configurable.

8.  **Fault Tolerance (Simplified):**  Assume that a bank service can *temporarily* fail (e.g., network glitch).  Implement a simple retry mechanism (e.g., exponential backoff) for commit and rollback operations.  After a certain number of retries, if a service still fails to respond, log the failure and move on (the system should remain consistent even if one service is permanently unavailable, although a manual intervention process might be required in that case to reconcile data).

9.  **Logging:** Implement basic logging to track the progress of each transaction (e.g., transaction ID, participating services, phase transitions, errors, retries).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of participating bank services in a transaction can vary.
*   Bank services can be unreliable (temporary failures).
*   Transactions can be initiated concurrently.
*   Performance is important: Minimize the overall transaction latency.  Concurrency and efficient use of Go's goroutines and channels are crucial.
*   The solution should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the coordinator correctly ensure atomicity (all or nothing)?
*   Concurrency: Does the coordinator handle multiple transactions concurrently without deadlocks?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does the coordinator handle temporary service failures gracefully?
*   Performance: Is the transaction latency reasonable?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Error Handling: Are errors handled properly and logged appropriately?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, error handling, and Go's concurrency primitives. It is designed to be challenging and will require careful planning and implementation. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go programming problem designed to be difficult and incorporate the elements you requested:

## Project Name

`ScalableSocialNetwork`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, scalable social network backend. The core functionality revolves around managing users, their connections (friendships), and efficiently retrieving news feeds. Due to the potential for massive user growth, your solution must prioritize scalability and performance.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **User Management:**
    *   Implement functionality to create new users with a unique user ID (e.g., UUID).
    *   Store user data efficiently (consider memory usage and retrieval speed).  Assume user data includes at least: ID, username, and a profile text field.

2.  **Friendship Management:**
    *   Implement functionality to establish and remove friendships between users.  Friendships are undirected (if A is a friend of B, then B is a friend of A).
    *   Design a data structure to efficiently represent the social graph (user connections).  Optimize for retrieving a user's friends.
    *   Prevent duplicate friendships.

3.  **News Feed Generation:**
    *   Each user generates "posts" (simple text messages).
    *   Implement a news feed for each user.  A user's news feed should contain posts from their direct friends.
    *   The news feed should be sorted by timestamp in descending order (most recent posts first).
    *   **Scalability Challenge:**  News feed generation must be efficient, even for users with a large number of friends or a large volume of posts.  Consider pre-computation or caching strategies.
    *   **Constraint:** When retrieving a news feed, limit the number of posts returned to a specified `pageSize`.  Implement pagination to retrieve subsequent posts (e.g., using an `offset`).

4.  **Mutual Friends:**
    *   Implement a function to efficiently find the mutual friends between two given users.  This function should be optimized for performance, especially when dealing with users who have a large number of connections.

5. **Concurrency:**
   * The system must be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple users adding friends, removing friends and posting messages. Design your system to be safe for concurrency.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Memory Usage:** Strive to minimize memory footprint, especially when storing user data and the social graph.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for fast retrieval of friend lists and news feed generation.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms. Pay special attention to minimizing database queries (if applicable â€“ an in-memory solution is acceptable for this problem, but your design should be adaptable to a database).
*   **Scalability:** Design your solution with scalability in mind.  Consider how your design would handle millions of users and a large number of connections.  Think about potential bottlenecks and how to address them (e.g., sharding, caching).
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases such as:
    *   Attempting to add a friendship with a non-existent user.
    *   Attempting to remove a friendship that doesn't exist.
    *   Retrieving a news feed for a user with no friends or no posts.
    *   Invalid `offset` or `pageSize` values for news feed retrieval.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and return meaningful error messages.
*   **No External Libraries (Mostly):** You are encouraged to use standard Go libraries (e.g., `sync`, `container/heap`), but avoid relying heavily on external libraries that provide pre-built social network functionality. Libraries for UUID generation or basic data structures are acceptable.  The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
*   **Efficiency Metric:** Your solution will be evaluated on its average news feed retrieval time for users with a varying number of friends and posts. A lower average retrieval time indicates a better solution. Also, the solution will be evaluated on memory usage.

**Input/Output:**

While a full API specification is not required, your solution should provide clear functions or methods for the following operations:

*   `CreateUser(username string, profileText string) (userID string, error)`
*   `AddFriend(userID1 string, userID2 string) error`
*   `RemoveFriend(userID1 string, userID2 string) error`
*   `PostMessage(userID string, message string) error`
*   `GetNewsFeed(userID string, offset int, pageSize int) ([]Post, error)` where `Post` is a struct containing the message, timestamp, and user ID of the poster.
*   `GetMutualFriends(userID1 string, userID2 string) ([]string, error)`

**Judging Criteria:**

Solutions will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Does the solution correctly implement all the required functionality and handle edge cases?
*   **Performance:**  How efficient is the news feed generation and mutual friend finding?
*   **Scalability:**  How well does the solution scale to handle a large number of users and connections?
*   **Code Quality:**  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?  Does it follow Go best practices?
*   **Memory Usage:** How efficiently does the solution use memory?

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and concurrency, making it a challenging task for experienced Go programmers. Good luck!

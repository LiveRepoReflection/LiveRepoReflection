## Question: Optimal Network Partitioning for Byzantine Fault Tolerance

**Description:**

You are designing a critical distributed system that must tolerate Byzantine faults. This system consists of `N` nodes, where `N` can be a large number (up to 10^5). The nodes are interconnected via a network. The network's topology is represented as an undirected graph where nodes are vertices and network connections are edges.

Due to the possibility of Byzantine faults (where nodes can behave arbitrarily, including sending incorrect or malicious data), you need to partition the network into `K` disjoint groups. The goal is to minimize the potential damage caused by a Byzantine node.

A key concept is the *Byzantine resilience* of a group. A group of nodes is *Byzantine resilient* if it can tolerate up to `f` faulty nodes, where `f` is less than one-third of the group's size (i.e., `f < group_size / 3`).  For example, a group of size 4 can tolerate 1 faulty node.

However, communication *between* these groups is still necessary. You need to choose the partitioning that minimizes the *inter-group communication cost*. The inter-group communication cost is defined as the total number of edges that connect nodes belonging to *different* groups.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 10^5). Nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `K`: The desired number of groups (1 <= K <= min(N, 20)). Creating more groups increases isolation but can dramatically increase inter-group communication cost.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v` (0 <= u, v < N). Assume there are no self-loops or duplicate edges. The number of edges will not exceed 2 * 10^5.
*   `group_sizes`: A list of integers, where `group_sizes[i]` represents the *minimum* size required for group `i`.  This is because each group must reach a minimum size to be considered useful. The sum of `group_sizes` must be less than or equal to `N`.

**Output:**

The minimum inter-group communication cost achievable when partitioning the `N` nodes into `K` groups such that:

1.  Each node belongs to exactly one group.
2.  Each group meets its minimum size requirement as specified in `group_sizes`.
3.  Each group is Byzantine resilient (i.e., `group_size > 3 * f` is true, or `group_size` is 0).  Assume `f = 1` for all groups. (Each group size must be at least 4, or zero.)

If no valid partitioning is possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm needs to be efficient enough to handle the specified input sizes. A brute-force approach of trying all possible partitions will likely time out.
*   **Optimization:** Finding the absolute optimal solution is computationally expensive. A good heuristic or approximation algorithm is expected.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no valid partitioning exists, or where the network is disconnected.
*   **Scalability:**  Consider how your solution might scale if `N` and the number of edges increase significantly.
*   **Real-World Relevance:** This problem models a common challenge in distributed systems security â€“ isolating faults and minimizing the impact of malicious or faulty components.

**Example:**

```
N = 7
K = 2
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6)]
group_sizes = [3, 3]

# One possible solution:
# Group 1: {0, 1, 2, 3}
# Group 2: {4, 5, 6}

# Inter-group communication cost: 2 (edges (2, 4) and (3, 5))

# Another possible solution:
# Group 1: {0, 1, 2}
# Group 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}

# This solution is not valid because group 1 does not meet the minimum group size requirements.

# The optimal solution might be different depending on the constraints.

# Return: The minimum inter-group communication cost.
```

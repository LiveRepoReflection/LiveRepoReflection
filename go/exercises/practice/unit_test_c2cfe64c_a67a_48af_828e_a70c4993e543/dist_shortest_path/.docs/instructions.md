Okay, here's a challenging problem for a Go programming competition, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and a touch of system design.

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a large, dynamically changing graph. The graph represents a network of interconnected servers.

**The System:**

*   The graph is distributed across multiple server nodes. Each server node maintains a partial view of the overall graph. It knows its direct neighbors (adjacent nodes) and the associated edge weights (latency between servers).
*   Servers can join and leave the network dynamically. Edge weights (latency) can also change dynamically.
*   There is no central authority or global knowledge of the entire graph. Each server only has local information.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function, `FindShortestPath`, that takes the ID of a source server node and the ID of a destination server node as input. The function must return the shortest path between these two nodes, considering the dynamically changing nature of the network.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Distributed Computation:** The shortest path must be computed in a distributed manner, meaning no single server should hold the entire graph data. Servers must communicate with each other to discover the shortest path.
2.  **Dynamic Updates:** The algorithm must be resilient to changes in the graph topology (servers joining/leaving) and edge weights (latency changes). Your algorithm must be able to adapt to these changes and converge to the correct shortest path.
3.  **Scalability:** The algorithm should be scalable to handle a large number of servers and edges. Consider the communication overhead and computational complexity.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The algorithm should be reasonably fault-tolerant. If some servers become temporarily unavailable, the remaining servers should still be able to find the shortest path, if it exists.
5.  **Optimality:** While finding the absolute shortest path is ideal, the algorithm should strive to find a near-optimal path within a reasonable time frame, especially in large and dynamic networks.
6.  **Communication Protocol:** You are free to choose a communication protocol for servers to exchange information (e.g., using message passing, RPC, or a gossip protocol).  Consider the trade-offs of each protocol in terms of efficiency, reliability, and complexity.  Document your choice and reasoning.

**Input:**

*   `sourceNodeID`:  The ID of the starting server node (string).
*   `destinationNodeID`: The ID of the target server node (string).
*   `graphData`: A map representing the local graph data of a server, where the key is the node ID (string), and the value is a map of neighbor node IDs to edge weights (float64).

**Output:**

*   A list of node IDs representing the shortest path from the source to the destination (\[]string). If no path exists, return an empty list.
*   A float64 representing the total cost of the shortest path (sum of edge weights). If no path exists, return -1.0.
*   An error, if any occurred during the process.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   Correctness: Does the algorithm find the correct shortest path (or a near-optimal path)?
*   Performance: How quickly does the algorithm converge to the shortest path?
*   Scalability: How well does the algorithm scale to a large number of servers and edges?
*   Fault Tolerance: How resilient is the algorithm to server failures?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?

**Assumptions:**

*   Node IDs are unique strings.
*   Edge weights (latency) are positive float64 values.
*   The graph is undirected (if A is a neighbor of B with weight W, then B is also a neighbor of A with weight W).
*   You can simulate the distributed environment and communication between servers within your Go program.  You don't need to deploy to actual servers.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a distributed version of Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
*   Explore gossip protocols for disseminating graph information and updates.
*   Think about how to handle concurrency and synchronization issues in a distributed environment.
*   Consider adding a timeout mechanism to prevent the algorithm from running indefinitely in case of network issues.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, distributed systems concepts, and concurrency in Go. It also encourages you to think about the trade-offs between different design choices and optimization techniques. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging and require a good understanding of algorithms and data structures in Go.

### Project Name:

```
distributed-rate-limiter
```

### Question Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter.  Imagine you are building a highly scalable API service that needs to protect itself from abuse and ensure fair usage.  A single rate limiter instance is not sufficient due to the distributed nature of your service. Therefore, you need a distributed rate limiter.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Token Bucket Algorithm:**  The rate limiter should implement the token bucket algorithm. Each incoming request consumes a token. If there are no tokens available, the request should be rate-limited (rejected).

2.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must operate correctly across multiple instances of your service. This implies you need a shared, persistent storage for the token buckets. Assume you have access to a Redis cluster. You can use any Redis library for Go.

3.  **Atomic Operations:** Token consumption must be atomic to prevent race conditions when multiple requests arrive simultaneously.

4.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The rate limiter should support dynamic configuration of rate limits. You should be able to change the rate limit (tokens per second) for a given client without restarting the service.  Assume that the rate limits are stored in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and are periodically synchronized with the rate limiter instances. The synchronization interval should be configurable.

5.  **Granularity:** The rate limiter should support rate limits at different granularities.  For example, you should be able to rate-limit per user ID, per API key, or even globally.  The granularity should be configurable.  Assume you can uniquely identify each request using a key (e.g., a user ID or API key) that is passed to the rate limiter.

6.  **Burst Capacity:**  The token bucket should have a configurable burst capacity, representing the maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold. This allows for short bursts of requests even if the rate limit is exceeded.

7.  **Scalability:**  The rate limiter should be designed to handle a high volume of requests with low latency.  Consider the performance implications of your design.

8.  **Concurrency:** The system should be concurrency safe.

9.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, including logging and appropriate error responses.  Consider potential Redis connection errors or database synchronization failures.

10. **Configuration:** All parameters, such as Redis connection details, database connection details, synchronization interval, default rate limits, and burst capacity, should be configurable through environment variables or a configuration file.

**Constraints:**

*   You must use Go for your implementation.
*   You must use Redis for storing the token buckets.
*   You must design a system that is scalable, reliable, and efficient.
*   Assume the key for each user is a string.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the rate limiter accurately enforce the configured rate limits?
*   **Concurrency Safety:** Does the rate limiter handle concurrent requests correctly?
*   **Scalability:** How well does the rate limiter perform under high load?
*   **Robustness:** Does the rate limiter handle errors gracefully?
*   **Maintainability:** Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must have O(1) complexity for each rate limit check.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, and performance optimization. It challenges the solver to design a robust and scalable solution that meets the specific requirements and constraints. Good luck!

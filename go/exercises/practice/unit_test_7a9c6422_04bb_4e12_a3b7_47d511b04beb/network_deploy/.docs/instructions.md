`OptimalNetworkDeployment`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing the optimal deployment strategy for a network of interconnected services in a distributed system. The system consists of `N` services and `M` potential network links between them. Each service `i` has a specific resource requirement `R_i` (CPU, memory, etc.) and a deployment cost `C_i` associated with hosting it on a particular server.

The network links have associated bandwidth capacities `B_ij` between service `i` and service `j`. Furthermore, there's an estimated communication volume `V_ij` between services `i` and `j`. If two services `i` and `j` are not deployed on the same server, their communication must utilize the network link between them (if it exists).

Your goal is to determine the optimal set of servers to deploy each service on, such that the total cost of deployment is minimized while satisfying the following constraints:

1.  **Resource Constraints:** Each server has a fixed capacity `S`. The sum of resource requirements `R_i` of all services deployed on a single server cannot exceed `S`.

2.  **Bandwidth Constraints:** For every pair of services `i` and `j` deployed on different servers, the communication volume `V_ij` must be less than or equal to the available bandwidth `B_ij` between them. If `B_ij` is 0, services i and j must be deployed on the same server.

3.  **Latency Constraint:** There is a maximum allowed latency `L`. The latency between two services `i` and `j` deployed on different servers is defined by the path with the least total latency between servers hosting `i` and `j`. Latency between two services on same server is defined as `0`. Each link between servers `x` and `y` has a defined latency `L_xy`. If the minimum latency exceeds `L`, they have to be deployed on the same server.

4.  **Redundancy Constraint**: At least K unique services need to be deployed on each server.

You are given the following inputs:

*   `N`: The number of services.
*   `M`: The number of potential network links.
*   `R`: An array of size `N` representing the resource requirements of each service. `R[i]` is the resource requirement of service `i`.
*   `C`: An array of size `N` representing the deployment cost of each service. `C[i]` is the deployment cost of service `i`.
*   `B`: A 2D array of size `N x N` representing the bandwidth capacities between services. `B[i][j]` is the bandwidth capacity between service `i` and service `j`.
*   `V`: A 2D array of size `N x N` representing the communication volume between services. `V[i][j]` is the communication volume between service `i` and service `j`.
*   `S`: The capacity of each server.
*   `L`: The maximum allowed latency between services not deployed on the same server.
*   `L_xy`: A 2D array representing latency between servers x and y.
*   `K`: The minimum number of unique services that must be deployed on each server.

Your code must determine the minimum total deployment cost required to deploy all `N` services while satisfying all the constraints. If no valid deployment is possible, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 20`
*   `0 <= M <= N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   `1 <= R[i] <= S`
*   `1 <= C[i] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= B[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= V[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `1 <= S <= 50`
*   `0 <= L <= 100`
*   `1 <= K <= N`

**Optimization Requirement:**

The solution must be efficient enough to handle the largest possible input within a reasonable time limit (e.g., under 10 seconds). You'll likely need to employ pruning techniques or heuristics to avoid exploring the entire search space.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (for latency calculations), optimization techniques (for cost minimization), and careful handling of constraints. Due to the constraints, the search space is large, and an efficient algorithm is critical for solving it within the time limit.

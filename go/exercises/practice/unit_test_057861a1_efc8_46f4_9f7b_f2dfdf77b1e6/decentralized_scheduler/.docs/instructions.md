## Question: Decentralized Event Scheduling with Conflict Resolution

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a decentralized event scheduling system. Imagine a large organization where employees need to schedule meetings and events. However, the system should be decentralized, meaning there is no central authority managing the schedule. Each employee has their own local calendar, and the system needs to ensure consistency and resolve conflicts across these calendars in a peer-to-peer manner.

**Specifics:**

*   **Event Representation:** An event is defined by a start time, end time, a description, and a set of participants (employee IDs). Time is represented as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch).

```go
type Event struct {
    Start       int64
    End         int64
    Description string
    Participants []string
    ID          string // Unique event ID, generated using UUID
}
```

*   **Calendar Representation:** Each employee maintains a local calendar, which is simply a list of `Event` structs.

```go
type Calendar struct {
    Events []Event
}
```

*   **Conflict Detection:** Two events conflict if they share at least one participant and their time ranges overlap.  Specifically, `Event A` and `Event B` conflict if:

    *   `A.Start <= B.End && A.End >= B.Start`
    *   `At least one participant is in both A.Participants and B.Participants`

*   **Decentralized Conflict Resolution:** When an employee proposes a new event, the system must check for conflicts with existing events across *all* participant calendars. Since this is decentralized, employees must communicate directly with each other to check calendars.

*   **Consensus Mechanism:** Due to network latency and potential inconsistencies, a consensus mechanism is required to resolve conflicting events. Implement a simplified version of Paxos (or Raft, if you prefer) for reaching consensus on whether a proposed event should be added to the participant's calendars. The simplified version must have the following characteristics:
    *   **Propose:** A proposer (the employee creating the event) sends a proposal to all participants.
    *   **Promise:** Participants respond with a promise to not accept any proposals with a lower proposal ID. This promise includes their current event list and the highest proposal ID they have seen.
    *   **Accept:** If the proposer receives a majority of promises, it sends an accept message to all participants.
    *   **Learn:** Participants accept the proposed event if they haven't already accepted a higher-priority proposal.

*   **Optimization Requirements:** Given that checking for conflicts across numerous calendars can be time-consuming, you should optimize the conflict detection and resolution process. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to improve efficiency. Specifically, the conflict detection stage should not be `O(n*m*k)` where `n` is the number of employees, `m` is the average number of events per employee, and `k` is the average number of participants per event.

**Constraints:**

*   The system should be able to handle a large number of employees (e.g., thousands).
*   The system should be fault-tolerant, meaning it can still function correctly even if some employees are temporarily unavailable.
*   The event scheduling process should be as efficient as possible, minimizing the time required to schedule an event.
*   Implement a mechanism to prevent deadlock situations during conflict resolution.
*   Assume a simplified network model: all employees can directly communicate with each other (no complex routing).  You can use channels for simulating network communication.
*   You are required to demonstrate that your system correctly schedules events, resolves conflicts, and can handle a large number of employees.
*   The Paxos implementation does not need to be fully robust and optimized for real-world distributed systems. You can make reasonable simplifications to meet the core requirements of the problem.

**Deliverables:**

*   Go code that implements the decentralized event scheduling system, including:
    *   Data structures for representing events and calendars.
    *   Functions for detecting conflicts between events.
    *   An implementation of the simplified Paxos consensus mechanism.
    *   A mechanism for handling network communication (using channels).
    *   A driver function that demonstrates the system's functionality, scheduling events, resolving conflicts, and handling a large number of employees.

This problem challenges the solver to combine knowledge of data structures, algorithms, distributed systems concepts (consensus), and Go concurrency features. The optimization requirement adds another layer of complexity, forcing the solver to think critically about the efficiency of their solution. The multiple edge cases (e.g., handling concurrent proposals, dealing with unavailable participants) further increase the difficulty.

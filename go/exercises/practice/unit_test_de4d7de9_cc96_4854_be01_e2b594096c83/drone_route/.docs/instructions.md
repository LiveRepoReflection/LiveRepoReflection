## Question Title: Optimal Multi-Hop Route Planning with Resource Constraints

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a route planning service for a logistics company that specializes in delivering packages using a network of autonomous drones. The drone network operates across a geographical area represented as a weighted, directed graph. Each node in the graph represents a drone station, and each edge represents a direct flight path between two stations. The weight of each edge represents the time (in minutes) it takes for a drone to travel between those two stations.

Each drone has a limited battery capacity, represented as the maximum flight time it can sustain before needing to recharge. A drone can only recharge at drone stations. Recharging at a station takes a fixed amount of time, *R* minutes.

Given a starting station *S*, a destination station *D*, a fleet of identical drones with battery capacity *B*, and the recharge time *R*, find the *minimum time* required for a drone to travel from *S* to *D*.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The graph can contain up to 10,000 nodes and 50,000 edges.
*   Drone stations are numbered from 0 to N-1, where N is the total number of drone stations.
*   Edge weights (flight times) are positive integers.
*   The battery capacity *B* and recharge time *R* are positive integers.
*   A drone can only travel along existing edges in the directed graph.
*   It is possible that no route exists between *S* and *D* given the battery constraints. In this case, return -1.
*   A drone can recharge multiple times along a route.
*   A drone can start its journey with a fully charged battery at the starting station *S*.
*   The drone must have sufficient battery to reach the destination station *D*. It does not need to have any battery remaining upon arrival.
*   The same station can be visited multiple times.
*   Consider memory usage carefully - excessive memory usage will result in failure.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

1.  *N*: The number of drone stations (nodes in the graph).
2.  *M*: The number of flight paths (edges in the graph).
3.  A list of *M* lines, each representing a flight path: *u v w*, where *u* is the starting station, *v* is the destination station, and *w* is the flight time (weight).
4.  *S*: The starting station.
5.  *D*: The destination station.
6.  *B*: The battery capacity (maximum flight time).
7.  *R*: The recharge time.

**Output:**

The output should be a single integer representing the minimum time required to travel from *S* to *D*. If no route exists, output -1.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
4
5
0 1 10
0 2 15
1 3 20
2 3 5
0 3 40
0
3
30
10
```

**Explanation:**

*   4 drone stations (0, 1, 2, 3)
*   5 flight paths:
    *   0 -> 1 (10 minutes)
    *   0 -> 2 (15 minutes)
    *   1 -> 3 (20 minutes)
    *   2 -> 3 (5 minutes)
    *   0 -> 3 (40 minutes)
*   Start station: 0
*   Destination station: 3
*   Battery capacity: 30 minutes
*   Recharge time: 10 minutes

One optimal route is: 0 -> 2 -> 3. This takes 15 + 5 = 20 minutes of flight time. The drone starts with 30 minutes of battery. It arrives at station 2 with 15 minutes of battery remaining. At station 2, the drone doesn't need to recharge. Then flies to station 3 which takes 5 minutes. The drone arrives with 10 minutes of battery remaining. Total time is 20 minutes (flight time).

Another possible route is 0->1->3. This takes 10+20 = 30 minutes of flight time. The drone arrives at station 1 with 20 minutes of battery remaining. At station 1, the drone doesn't need to recharge. Then flies to station 3 which takes 20 minutes. This route exceeds the battery capacity. However, if the drone recharges at station 1 it has enough time to reach station 3. The total travel time is 10(0->1) + 10(recharge at 1) + 20(1->3) = 40

**Output:**

```
20
```

**Grading Rubric:**

*   Correctness (80%): Your solution must produce the correct output for a variety of test cases, including edge cases and large graphs.
*   Efficiency (20%): Your solution must be efficient enough to solve the problem within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds) for the given input size. Solutions that are excessively slow or memory-intensive will not receive full credit.

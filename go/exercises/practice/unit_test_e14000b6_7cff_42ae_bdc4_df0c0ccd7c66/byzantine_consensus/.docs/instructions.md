## Problem: Distributed Consensus with Byzantine Fault Tolerance

**Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a distributed consensus algorithm that can tolerate Byzantine faults. In a distributed system, multiple nodes need to agree on a single value, even when some nodes might be faulty and behave maliciously. This is crucial for applications like blockchain, distributed databases, and secure multi-party computation.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a network of `n` nodes trying to agree on a single transaction to be added to a distributed ledger. Each node starts with a proposed transaction. However, up to `f` nodes can be Byzantine, meaning they can exhibit arbitrary behavior, including:

*   Sending conflicting messages to different nodes.
*   Not sending messages at all.
*   Sending incorrect or malformed messages.
*   Colluding with each other to disrupt the consensus process.

Your goal is to implement an algorithm that guarantees the following properties:

*   **Agreement:** All non-faulty nodes eventually agree on the same transaction.
*   **Validity:** If all non-faulty nodes initially proposed the same transaction, then all non-faulty nodes eventually agree on that transaction.
*   **Termination:** The algorithm must eventually terminate, and all non-faulty nodes must reach a decision within a reasonable timeframe.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The total number of nodes in the network.
*   `f`: The maximum number of Byzantine nodes the system can tolerate.
*   `nodeID`: The ID of the current node (ranging from 0 to `n-1`).
*   `initialValue`: The transaction proposed by the current node.
*   A communication interface that allows you to:
    *   `send(destinationNodeID, message)`: Sends a message to a specific node.
    *   `receive()`: Receives incoming messages (returns a list of messages, each containing the sender's ID and the message content).

**Output:**

*   The final agreed-upon transaction value.

**Constraints:**

*   `3f + 1 <= n` (The system must tolerate at least a third of faulty nodes, i.e., the number of nodes `n` must be more than three times the number of fault nodes `f`)
*   The transaction value can be any arbitrary data structure serializable to a byte array.
*   The communication interface is asynchronous and unreliable (messages might be delayed or dropped, but not corrupted).
*   Nodes do not know the identities of the Byzantine nodes.
*   The algorithm should be efficient in terms of message complexity and time complexity.
*   **The solution needs to be resilient to sophisticated attacks from the Byzantine nodes, including collusion, timing attacks, and message manipulation.**

**Requirements:**

1.  Implement a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm in Go. You can choose any well-known BFT algorithm like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), Tendermint, or HotStuff, or you can design your own.
2.  Your implementation must adhere to the agreement, validity, and termination properties.
3.  Your solution should be optimized for performance, considering the constraints of message complexity and time complexity.
4.  The communication interface must be used for all inter-node communication.
5.  Provide clear documentation explaining the algorithm you chose, the rationale behind your design decisions, and the trade-offs you made.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the algorithm correctly achieve consensus under Byzantine conditions?
*   Efficiency: How efficient is the algorithm in terms of message complexity and time complexity?
*   Fault Tolerance: How well does the algorithm tolerate Byzantine faults?
*   Robustness: Is the algorithm resistant to sophisticated attacks?
*   Clarity: How clear and well-documented is the code?
*   Completeness: Does the solution address all the requirements and constraints?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed consensus, Byzantine fault tolerance, and algorithm design. It challenges the solver to implement a robust and efficient solution that can withstand malicious attacks in a distributed environment. Good luck!

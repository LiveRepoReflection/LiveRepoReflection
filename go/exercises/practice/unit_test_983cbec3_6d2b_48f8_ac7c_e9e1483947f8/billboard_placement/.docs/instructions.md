## Question: Optimal Billboard Placement

**Problem Description:**

A major advertising company, "AdVerse," wants to maximize its revenue by strategically placing billboards along a long, straight highway. The highway is represented as a number line. AdVerse has identified `n` potential billboard locations. Each location `i` is defined by its distance `position[i]` from the start of the highway and the revenue `revenue[i]` AdVerse would earn if a billboard is placed at that location.

However, due to aesthetic concerns and local regulations, there's a minimum distance requirement: no two billboards can be placed closer than `minDistance` units apart.

Given the `position` and `revenue` arrays (both of length `n`), and the `minDistance`, determine the maximum total revenue AdVerse can generate by placing billboards optimally along the highway, respecting the minimum distance constraint.

**Input:**

*   `position`: An array of integers representing the positions of potential billboard locations along the highway. Sorted in non-decreasing order.
*   `revenue`: An array of integers representing the revenue generated by placing a billboard at the corresponding position.
*   `minDistance`: An integer representing the minimum distance required between any two billboards.

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the maximum total revenue AdVerse can generate.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100,000`
*   `0 <= position[i] <= 1,000,000,000`
*   `1 <= revenue[i] <= 1,000,000`
*   `1 <= minDistance <= 1,000,000,000`
*   `position` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Example:**

```
position = [1, 2, 3, 6]
revenue = [5, 1, 3, 5]
minDistance = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Place billboards at positions 1 and 6 for a total revenue of 5 + 5 = 10.  Placing at positions 1 and 3 is invalid because the distance between 1 and 3 is 2, which is not strictly greater than minDistance = 2.
```

```
position = [1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
revenue = [3, 5, 1, 4, 2]
minDistance = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Place billboards at positions 1, 4, and 8 for a total revenue of 3 + 5 + 4 = 12.
```

**Considerations:**

*   The size of the input data (n = 100,000) requires an efficient algorithm. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.
*   The large range of `position` and `minDistance` values (up to 1,000,000,000) suggests that a data structure or algorithm dependent on these specific values may not be suitable.
*   Multiple valid approaches might exist with different time and space complexity trade-offs. Dynamic programming, recursion with memoization, or a greedy approach with careful consideration might be viable.
*   Edge cases, such as an empty input or a `minDistance` larger than the range of positions, should be handled correctly.
*   The sorted nature of the `position` array should be exploited for efficiency.

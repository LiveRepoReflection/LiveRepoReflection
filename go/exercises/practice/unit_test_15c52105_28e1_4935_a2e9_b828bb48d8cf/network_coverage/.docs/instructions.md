## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkCoverage`

## Question Description

A telecommunications company is deploying a 5G network across a large, sparsely populated region. They have a limited number of base stations to deploy, and the goal is to maximize the coverage area while ensuring a minimum signal strength for all covered locations. The region can be represented as a grid of `N x M` cells.

Each cell has a population density value representing the potential user base. Deploying a base station provides coverage to cells within a given radius `R`.  The signal strength at a cell decreases with distance from the base station.  The signal strength at a cell (x, y) from a base station at (i, j) is calculated as:

`SignalStrength(x, y, i, j) = BaseSignalStrength / (Distance(x, y, i, j) + 1)`

Where:

*   `BaseSignalStrength` is a constant value provided as input.
*   `Distance(x, y, i, j)` is the Manhattan distance between cell (x, y) and base station (i, j): `|x - i| + |y - j|`.

The company needs to determine the optimal locations for `K` base stations to maximize the total population covered with acceptable signal strength. A cell is considered covered if the maximum signal strength received from any of the base stations is greater than or equal to a `MinimumSignalStrength` threshold (provided as input). The total population covered is the sum of population densities of all covered cells.

**Input:**

*   `N`: Number of rows in the grid (integer, 1 <= N <= 100)
*   `M`: Number of columns in the grid (integer, 1 <= M <= 100)
*   `PopulationDensity`: A 2D array of integers representing the population density of each cell (0 <= PopulationDensity[i][j] <= 1000).
*   `K`: Number of base stations to deploy (integer, 1 <= K <= 10)
*   `R`: Coverage radius of a base station (integer, 1 <= R <= min(N, M))
*   `BaseSignalStrength`: The base signal strength of a base station (float, 1.0 <= BaseSignalStrength <= 100.0)
*   `MinimumSignalStrength`: The minimum acceptable signal strength (float, 0.1 <= MinimumSignalStrength <= BaseSignalStrength)

**Output:**

An array of `K` tuples, where each tuple represents the (row, column) coordinates of a base station.  The coordinates should be 0-indexed.

**Constraints:**

*   You must place exactly `K` base stations.
*   Base stations can only be placed on cells within the grid (0 <= row < N, 0 <= column < M).
*   Multiple base stations can be placed at the same cell.
*   The goal is to maximize the total population covered with acceptable signal strength. Your solution will be judged based on the total population covered.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle the given input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize the search for the best base station locations.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   `K` is close to `N * M`: Placing a base station on almost every possible cell.
*   `R` is very small: Coverage is limited, so optimal placement is crucial.
*   `R` is large: Each base station covers a significant area, so placement has overlapping effects.
*   Highly uneven population distribution: Some areas are densely populated, while others are sparsely populated.
*   `BaseSignalStrength` close to `MinimumSignalStrength`
*   `PopulationDensity` is uniform.

**Judging:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the total population covered, measured as the sum of the `PopulationDensity` of cells with signal strength greater than or equal to `MinimumSignalStrength`.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a greedy approach, simulated annealing, or genetic algorithms to find a near-optimal solution.
*   Think about pre-calculating signal strengths to avoid redundant calculations.
*   Explore spatial indexing techniques to efficiently determine cells within the coverage radius.
*   Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

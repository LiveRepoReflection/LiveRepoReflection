Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description designed for a competitive programming context.

**Problem Title: Distributed Rate Limiter with Adaptive Throttling**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service in Go. This service should handle a high volume of incoming requests and prevent any single client from overwhelming the system.  Unlike a simple rate limiter, this one needs to *adapt* to the overall system load and dynamically adjust the rate limits for individual clients.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a globally distributed API service.  Clients access your API from various locations.  You need to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, but also want to maximize throughput and minimize latency for legitimate users, even during peak load.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter service must be able to run across multiple nodes/instances.  Clients should be able to send requests to any node, and the rate limiting logic must be consistent across the entire cluster.

2.  **Client Identification:** Each client is uniquely identified by a string `clientID`.

3.  **Dynamic Rate Limits:**  The core of the challenge lies here.  The rate limit for each client is *not* fixed.  Instead, it's controlled by a global system-wide "load factor".

    *   The base rate limit for each client is `baseLimit`.
    *   The *effective* rate limit for a client is `effectiveLimit = baseLimit * loadFactor`.
    *   The `loadFactor` is a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).  A `loadFactor` of 1.0 means the client gets its full `baseLimit`. A `loadFactor` of 0.5 means the client's rate limit is halved.

4.  **Base Limit Configuration:**  You need to provide a mechanism to set the `baseLimit` for each `clientID`. This should allow different clients to have different base limits.

5.  **Global Load Factor Adjustment:**  You need to provide a mechanism to adjust the global `loadFactor`. This should affect all clients.

6.  **Rate Limiting Logic:**

    *   The rate limiter tracks the number of requests made by each client within a sliding time window of `windowSize` (e.g., 1 second).
    *   If a client exceeds its `effectiveLimit` within the `windowSize`, the rate limiter should reject the request.
    *   If a client is within its `effectiveLimit`, the rate limiter should allow the request and increment the client's request count for the current window.

7.  **Concurrency:**  The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple clients without data races.

8.  **Efficiency:**  The rate limiter must be efficient in terms of memory usage and processing time.  The solution should be able to handle a large number of clients and a high request rate with minimal overhead.  Pay close attention to algorithmic complexity.

9.  **Fault Tolerance:** Implement a mechanism to handle node failures gracefully.

**Constraints:**

*   You must use Go.
*   You can use external libraries for inter-node communication (e.g., gRPC, Redis Pub/Sub, etc.) and distributed consensus (e.g., Raft, etcd, Consul) if necessary. However, simpler solutions that minimize dependencies are encouraged.
*   `baseLimit` will be a positive integer.
*   `windowSize` will be a positive integer representing seconds.
*   The system needs to support a large number of clients (millions).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the rate limiter correctly enforce the dynamic rate limits based on `baseLimit` and `loadFactor`?
*   Concurrency:  Is the solution thread-safe and free from data races?
*   Efficiency:  Does the solution scale well to a large number of clients and a high request rate?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does the solution handle node failures gracefully?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Design: Is the system design well thought out, and do the different components interact efficiently?

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement persistence of rate limiting data to survive node restarts.
*   Add metrics and monitoring to track the rate limiter's performance (e.g., request rate, rejection rate, latency).
*   Implement a mechanism to automatically adjust the `loadFactor` based on overall system health and resource utilization.
*   Consider using a more sophisticated data structure for the sliding window to improve efficiency (e.g., a circular buffer or a token bucket algorithm).

This problem is designed to be open-ended and allow for a variety of solutions with different trade-offs. Good luck!

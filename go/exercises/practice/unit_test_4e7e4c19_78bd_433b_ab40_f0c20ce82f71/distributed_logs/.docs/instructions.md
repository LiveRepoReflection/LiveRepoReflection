Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and require sophisticated Go programming:

**Problem Title:**  Distributed Log Aggregation with Fault Tolerance

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a distributed log aggregation system.  Imagine a cluster of servers, each generating log files.  Your system needs to collect these logs, aggregate them in a central location, and make them available for querying.  However, servers can fail, and the network can be unreliable.  Therefore, the system must be fault-tolerant and resilient to network partitions.

Specifically, you need to implement the following components:

1.  **Log Producers:** Simulate multiple servers generating log entries. Each log entry consists of a timestamp (Unix epoch in nanoseconds, int64), a severity level (enum: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`), and a message (string). Log producers will generate logs at a configurable rate.

2.  **Log Collectors:** These are processes running on each server (or a subset of servers) that read local log files and forward log entries to the aggregator(s). Implement a mechanism for collectors to discover available aggregators (e.g., using a simple configuration file).

3.  **Log Aggregators:** These are the central components responsible for receiving logs from collectors, storing them (in memory or on disk - your choice, but document the trade-offs), and making them available for querying.

4.  **Query Interface:** Implement a simple query interface that allows users to retrieve logs based on time range and severity level.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Fault Tolerance:**  The system must continue to operate correctly even if some log producers, collectors, or aggregators fail.  Consider using techniques like replication or consistent hashing to ensure data is not lost.
*   **Data Consistency:** While strict consistency is difficult in a distributed system, strive for eventual consistency.  Explain the consistency model you're using and the potential for data loss or duplication.
*   **Scalability:**  The system should be designed to handle a large number of log producers and a high volume of log entries.  Consider using concurrency and parallelism to improve performance.
*   **Log Order:** Ensure that logs are aggregated and presented in chronological order as much as possible, despite the distributed nature of the system. Handle scenarios where log producers might have slightly skewed clocks.
*   **Network Resilience:** Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for collectors to handle temporary network failures when connecting to aggregators. Implement a timeout mechanism to ensure that collectors don't get stuck trying to send logs to unavailable aggregators.
*   **Optimization:** Pay attention to memory usage and CPU utilization. Optimize your code for performance, especially in the aggregation and querying components. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage, CPU usage, and query performance.
*   **Concurrency:** Use goroutines and channels effectively to handle concurrent log ingestion and querying. Avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
*   **Configuration:** Make the system configurable, allowing users to adjust the number of producers, collectors, and aggregators, as well as the log generation rate and other parameters.
*   **Resource Management:** Design the application to prevent memory leaks or unbounded resource consumption. Proper cleanup and resource releasing are important.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and handling duplicate log entries.
*   Add support for different log storage formats (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers).
*   Implement a more sophisticated query language with support for filtering and aggregation.
*   Integrate with a real-world logging framework like `logrus` or `zap`.
*   Implement a simple web interface for querying the logs.

This problem combines elements of distributed systems, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency, making it a challenging and sophisticated exercise for Go programmers. It forces the developer to think about real-world trade-offs and design decisions involved in building a scalable and fault-tolerant system. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem for a programming competition.

NetworkInterconnect

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient network interconnect for a data center. The data center consists of `n` servers, each identified by a unique integer from `0` to `n-1`.  Servers need to communicate with each other, and to facilitate this, a network interconnect is required.

The interconnect uses a Clos network architecture, specifically a 3-stage Clos network. This network is defined by three parameters: `r`, `m`, and `k`.

*   **Input Stage:** `r` input switches, each connected to `n/r` servers. Each input switch has `m` outputs.
*   **Middle Stage:** `m` middle switches. Each middle switch is connected to all `r` input switches and all `k` output switches.
*   **Output Stage:** `k` output switches, each connected to `n/k` servers. Each output switch has `m` inputs.

Each server is connected to exactly one input switch and exactly one output switch. Assume `n` is divisible by both `r` and `k`.

The goal is to write a function that, given the network parameters `n`, `r`, `m`, `k`, a source server `src`, and a destination server `dest`, finds the *minimum number of hops* required to transmit data from `src` to `dest` through the Clos network.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100,000` (Number of servers)
*   `1 <= r, m, k <= n` (Network parameters)
*   `n` is divisible by `r` and `k`.
*   `0 <= src, dest < n` (Valid server IDs)
*   The minimum number of hops should be calculated assuming optimal routing within the network.
*   You must optimize your solution for speed. Inefficient solutions will time out.

**Hops:**

A hop is defined as a traversal between two switches or a server and a switch. Therefore:

*   Server -> Input Switch is 1 hop.
*   Input Switch -> Middle Switch is 1 hop.
*   Middle Switch -> Output Switch is 1 hop.
*   Output Switch -> Server is 1 hop.

**Error Conditions:**

*   If there is no possible path between `src` and `dest`, return `-1`. This should only happen if any of the input parameters are not valid.

**Example:**

Let's say we have:

*   `n = 16` (16 servers)
*   `r = 4` (4 input switches)
*   `m = 4` (4 middle switches)
*   `k = 4` (4 output switches)
*   `src = 0` (Server 0)
*   `dest = 15` (Server 15)

A possible shortest path (4 hops) could be:

1.  Server 0 -> Input Switch 0
2.  Input Switch 0 -> Middle Switch (any of the 4)
3.  Middle Switch -> Output Switch 3
4.  Output Switch 3 -> Server 15

**Bonus Challenge:**

Consider that some links in the network might be faulty and unusable. You will be given a list of faulty links, represented as tuples `(type, id1, id2)`, where:

*   `type`: "input", "middle", or "output" indicating the type of link.
*   `id1`, `id2`: IDs of the switches/server connected by the link. The meaning of `id1` and `id2` depends on the `type`.
    *   `type == "input"`: `id1` is the input switch number (0 to r-1), `id2` is the middle switch number (0 to m-1)
    *   `type == "middle"`: `id1` is the middle switch number (0 to m-1), `id2` is the output switch number (0 to k-1)
    *   `type == "output"`: `id1` is the output switch number (0 to k-1), `id2` is the server number (0 to n-1)
*  The original problem of finding the minimum number of hops should consider the faulty links. Return `-1` if no path is available due to faulty links.

This problem requires careful consideration of network topology, efficient pathfinding, and handling of edge cases. Good luck!

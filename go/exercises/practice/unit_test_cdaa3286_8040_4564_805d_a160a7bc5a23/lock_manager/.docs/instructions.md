Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Go programming problem. Here it is:

## Project Name

`Distributed Lock Manager`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed lock manager. This lock manager will be used by multiple independent services running across a cluster to coordinate access to shared resources. The system must handle concurrent requests, be resilient to failures, and ensure data consistency.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Lock/Unlock Operations:** Implement functions to acquire and release locks. `AcquireLock(resourceID string, clientID string, leaseDuration time.Duration) bool` and `ReleaseLock(resourceID string, clientID string) bool`.
    *   `resourceID`: A unique identifier for the resource being protected.
    *   `clientID`: A unique identifier for the client requesting or holding the lock.
    *   `leaseDuration`: The time duration for which the lock is granted. After this duration, the lock expires automatically.
    *   `AcquireLock` should return `true` if the lock is successfully acquired, `false` otherwise.
    *   `ReleaseLock` should return `true` if the lock is successfully released, `false` otherwise (e.g., if the client doesn't hold the lock).

2.  **Automatic Expiration:** Locks must automatically expire after their `leaseDuration`. The lock manager should implement a mechanism to ensure that expired locks are released, preventing indefinite blocking.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The lock manager should be able to tolerate node failures. Consider how to achieve this without relying on a central point of failure.  Assume a maximum of `N` lock manager instances might exist in the cluster, with `F` failures possible where `F < N/2` (Byzantine failures are not considered, just crash failures).

4.  **Concurrency Control:** Ensure that concurrent requests to acquire the same lock are handled correctly. Only one client should be able to hold the lock at any given time.

5.  **Reentrancy (Optional):** A client that already holds a lock should be able to acquire it again (reentrancy). The lock should only be released when the client has released it as many times as it acquired it.

6.  **Lock Extension (Optional):** Provide a mechanism for a client to extend the lease duration of a lock it already holds (`ExtendLock(resourceID string, clientID string, newLeaseDuration time.Duration) bool`).  This is useful for long-running operations that might exceed the initial lease duration.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Consensus:** You are **not allowed** to directly use a pre-built distributed consensus library like Raft or Paxos. However, you *can* implement a simplified consensus mechanism yourself if necessary to achieve fault tolerance (e.g., using quorums).  The goal is to understand the underlying principles.
*   **Scalability:** While not the primary focus, consider how your design might scale as the number of resources and clients increases.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for low latency lock acquisition and release. Minimize unnecessary network communication.
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensure that the state of the locks is consistent across the cluster, even in the presence of failures.
*   **Race Conditions:** Be extremely careful to avoid race conditions.
*   **Realistic Error Handling:** Handle network errors, timeouts, and other potential failures gracefully.
*   **Use Appropriate Data Structures:** Choose data structures that are well-suited for the task (e.g., maps, sets, etc.).
*   **Avoid Global Mutexes:** While local mutexes within a single lock manager instance are acceptable, avoid global mutexes that would serialize all operations.
*   **Implementations Details:** Focus on the core logic of the lock manager.  You don't need to implement actual resource protection (e.g., file access control). Just simulate the locking mechanism.
*   **Assume a Reliable Network:** You can assume a relatively reliable network with reasonable latency, but network partitions and temporary outages are still possible.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   **Deadlock Detection/Prevention:** Implement a mechanism to detect or prevent deadlocks.
*   **Fencing Tokens:** Integrate fencing tokens to ensure that stale lock holders cannot perform operations after the lock has been released.
*   **Metrics:** Expose metrics (e.g., lock acquisition time, lock contention rate) to monitor the performance of the lock manager.

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, distributed systems, and fault tolerance. It will challenge the solver to think critically about design trade-offs and optimization strategies. Good luck!

## Question Description

Design and implement a highly available and performant distributed lock service using Go. This service allows multiple clients to acquire and release locks on shared resources.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Basic Lock/Unlock:** Clients should be able to acquire and release locks identified by a string key (e.g., "resource\_id\_123").

2.  **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one client can hold a lock for a given key at any time.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The service should remain operational even if some of the underlying nodes fail. Consider using a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) for leader election and state replication.

4.  **Lock Expiration:** Locks should automatically expire after a specified duration (TTL) to prevent indefinite blocking in case of client failures. The TTL should be configurable per lock.

5.  **Lock Extension:** A client holding a lock should be able to extend the lock's TTL.

6.  **High Availability:** The service should be horizontally scalable to handle a large number of concurrent lock requests.

7.  **Performance:** Optimize for low latency and high throughput for lock acquisition and release operations.

8.  **Fairness (Optional but highly encouraged):** Attempt to provide a reasonable level of fairness in lock acquisition.  Prevent starvation where possible.  Totally strict FIFO fairness is not required, but egregious unfairness should be avoided.

9.  **Reentrancy (Optional but highly encouraged):**  Allow a client that already holds a lock to re-acquire it without blocking, incrementing an internal counter. The lock must be released the same number of times it was acquired by that client to be truly free.

**Constraints:**

*   The service should be implemented using Go.
*   You are allowed to use external libraries for consensus, networking, and data serialization. Popular choices include etcd/raft, grpc, and protobuf.
*   Assume a network environment with potential packet loss and delays.
*   Consider potential race conditions and ensure data consistency across the cluster.
*   The number of nodes in the cluster is configurable.
*   The maximum TTL should be configurable.

**Input:**

*   `AcquireLock(key string, clientID string, ttl time.Duration)`: Attempts to acquire a lock for the given key on behalf of the specified client with the given TTL. Returns true if the lock was acquired successfully, false otherwise.  The client ID is a unique identifier for each client.
*   `ReleaseLock(key string, clientID string)`: Releases the lock for the given key held by the specified client. Returns true if the lock was released successfully, false otherwise.
*   `ExtendLock(key string, clientID string, newTTL time.Duration)`: Extends the TTL of the lock for the given key held by the specified client. Returns true if the TTL was extended successfully, false otherwise.
*   `Status(key string)`:  Returns the lock status (locked/unlocked) and the clientID currently holding the lock (if locked).

**Output:**

*   Boolean value indicating success or failure of the lock operation for `AcquireLock`, `ReleaseLock`, and `ExtendLock`.
*   Lock status (boolean) and holder clientID (string) for `Status`.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The service correctly implements the lock/unlock semantics and handles concurrent requests.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The service remains operational under node failures.
*   **Performance:** The service achieves low latency and high throughput for lock operations.
*   **Scalability:** The service can handle a large number of concurrent clients and locks.
*   **Code Quality:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Error Handling:** The service handles errors gracefully and provides informative error messages.
*   **Concurrency Safety:** The code is free from race conditions and data corruption.
*   **Efficiency:** Avoid unnecessary memory allocation and CPU usage.
*   **Optional Features:**  Correct implementation of fairness and reentrancy will be heavily rewarded.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and Go programming. Good luck!

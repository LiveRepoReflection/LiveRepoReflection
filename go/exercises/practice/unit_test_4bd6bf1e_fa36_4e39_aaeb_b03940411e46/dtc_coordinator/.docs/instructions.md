## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture. This DTC will manage transactions spanning multiple services, ensuring atomicity (all or nothing) across operations.

Imagine a system where users can transfer funds between accounts residing in different services (e.g., an `AccountsService` and a `PaymentsService`). A transaction involves debiting one account in `AccountsService` and crediting another in `PaymentsService`. These operations must be atomic; either both succeed, or both fail.

Your DTC must implement the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol. This protocol involves two phases: a *Prepare* phase and a *Commit/Rollback* phase.

**Services Interface:**

Assume you have interfaces for interacting with the services involved in the transaction. These interfaces provide `Prepare` and `Commit/Rollback` methods, which must be implemented in your DTC.

**Your Task:**

Implement a function `CoordinateTransaction` that takes the following inputs:

1.  A `TransactionID` (string). This is a unique identifier for the transaction.
2.  A list of `ServiceOperations`. Each `ServiceOperation` represents an operation to be performed on a specific service. A `ServiceOperation` includes:
    *   `ServiceID` (string): Identifies the service.
    *   `PrepareFunc` (`func(TransactionID string) error`): A function that sends a "prepare" request to the service. This function should return `nil` on success and an error on failure.
    *   `CommitFunc` (`func(TransactionID string) error`): A function that sends a "commit" request to the service. This function should return `nil` on success and an error on failure.
    *   `RollbackFunc` (`func(TransactionID string) error`): A function that sends a "rollback" request to the service. This function should return `nil` on success and an error on failure.
3.  A timeout duration.

The `CoordinateTransaction` function should perform the following steps:

1.  **Prepare Phase:**  Iterate through the `ServiceOperations` and call the `PrepareFunc` for each service. Implement a timeout mechanism. If a service fails to prepare within the specified timeout, or if any service returns an error during preparation, the transaction must be rolled back.
2.  **Commit/Rollback Phase:**
    *   If all services prepared successfully, iterate through the `ServiceOperations` and call the `CommitFunc` for each service.  If any service fails to commit, log the error and continue committing to the remaining services. The system should attempt to commit to all prepared services even if some fail during the commit phase.
    *   If any service failed to prepare, iterate through the `ServiceOperations` and call the `RollbackFunc` for each service that successfully prepared. Log any errors during rollback. The system should attempt to rollback all prepared services even if some fail during the rollback phase.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The `PrepareFunc`, `CommitFunc`, and `RollbackFunc` calls to different services should be performed concurrently to minimize latency. Use goroutines and channels to manage concurrency.
*   **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for the prepare phase. If any service does not respond within the timeout duration, the transaction must be rolled back.
*   **Error Handling:**  Log all errors encountered during the prepare, commit, and rollback phases. Do not panic.  The `CoordinateTransaction` function should return a single error value indicating whether the transaction ultimately succeeded (all services committed) or failed (at least one service rolled back or timed out during prepare).
*   **Idempotency (Important):**  Assume the `CommitFunc` and `RollbackFunc` calls might be retried by the services themselves. Therefore, your `CoordinateTransaction` function **does not** need to implement retry logic for `CommitFunc` and `RollbackFunc`. But the services must handle duplicates.
*   **No External Dependencies:** The solution should not rely on any external libraries beyond the standard Go library.
*   **Performance:**  The solution should be designed for reasonable performance. Consider the overhead of goroutine creation and channel communication.
*   **Resource Management:** Ensure all goroutines are properly terminated and resources (e.g., channels) are released when the transaction is complete, regardless of success or failure.
*   **Testability:**  Your design should be testable. Consider how you would mock the `ServiceOperations` and verify the behavior of your `CoordinateTransaction` function.
*   **No Deadlock:** Make sure the concurrent execution doesn't cause any deadlock.

**Input Example:**

```go
type ServiceOperation struct {
	ServiceID    string
	PrepareFunc  func(TransactionID string) error
	CommitFunc   func(TransactionID string) error
	RollbackFunc func(TransactionID string) error
}

func CoordinateTransaction(transactionID string, operations []ServiceOperation, timeout time.Duration) error {
	// Your implementation here
}
```

**Goal:**

The primary goal is to implement a robust and efficient distributed transaction coordinator that adheres to the 2PC protocol, handles concurrency, timeouts, and errors gracefully, and is designed for testability and performance. Focus on the correctness of the 2PC protocol and the handling of edge cases.

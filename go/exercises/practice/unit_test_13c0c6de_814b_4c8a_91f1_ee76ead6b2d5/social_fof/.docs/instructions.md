Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging for Go programmers, focusing on graph algorithms, concurrency, and optimization.

### Project Name

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a distributed social graph service. The service will store and process relationships between users in a social network. The core functionality revolves around efficiently answering "friend of friend" (FoF) queries, which ask: "Given user A, find all users who are friends of A's friends, but not directly friends with A."

**Requirements:**

1.  **Data Storage:** The social graph data (user IDs and their direct friend relationships) is initially stored in a large, unsorted file. The file's format is: `user_id,friend_id\n`. Assume that `user_id` and `friend_id` are positive integers.  This file is too large to fit into the memory of a single machine.

2.  **Distributed System:** The service must be distributed across multiple nodes (simulated within a single machine using goroutines for this problem). You need to partition the social graph data across these nodes. A good partitioning strategy is crucial for performance. Consider using hash-based partitioning on `user_id` to distribute the graph data evenly.

3.  **Concurrent Processing:** Implement efficient concurrency to process queries.  Each node should handle queries independently, and a coordinator node should aggregate the results.

4.  **Friend of Friend (FoF) Query:** Implement the `FindFoF(userID int) []int` function. This function must:

    *   Accept a user ID as input.
    *   Query all nodes to retrieve the user's friends and their friends.
    *   Identify friends-of-friends who are *not* direct friends of the input user or the user itself.
    *   Return a sorted list of unique user IDs representing the FoFs.

5.  **Optimization:** The service must be optimized for fast FoF query response times.  Consider the following:

    *   **Minimizing data transfer:**  Efficiently transmit only the necessary data between nodes. Avoid transferring the entire graph for each query.
    *   **Parallel processing:**  Leverage concurrency to parallelize the query processing across nodes.
    *   **Data structures:** Use appropriate data structures for efficient lookups (e.g., sets for fast membership checks).
    *   **Partitioning Strategy:** The partitioning strategy needs to be optimized to minimize cross-node communication for FoF lookups.

**Constraints:**

*   The input file can be very large (e.g., hundreds of gigabytes).
*   Memory usage per node must be limited. You cannot load the entire graph into memory.
*   The number of nodes in the distributed system can be configured.
*   Duplicate friend relationships in the input file should be handled gracefully (e.g., by only storing a single instance of the relationship).

**Error Handling:**

*   Implement robust error handling.  Return appropriate errors if the input file is malformed, if a user ID is invalid, or if any node fails during query processing.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed FoF results. Consider using an LRU cache.
*   Implement a mechanism to dynamically rebalance the data across nodes if the data distribution becomes skewed.
*   Implement a gossip protocol to periodically update each node's knowledge of the overall graph structure, which can further optimize query routing and minimize cross-node communication.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, distributed systems concepts, concurrency in Go, and performance optimization techniques. It encourages you to think about data partitioning, communication patterns, and efficient data structures to build a scalable and responsive social graph service.

## Question Description

Imagine you are developing a pathfinding algorithm for an autonomous vehicle navigating a complex city environment. The city can be represented as a weighted directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments. Each road segment has a length (weight) and a set of traffic signals that affect the travel time. Each traffic signal also has a set of rules to follow, such as red light, green light and yellow light. The autonomous vehicle needs to find the fastest path from a starting intersection to a destination intersection while considering real-time traffic signal states, variable road conditions, unexpected events, and respecting traffic laws.

The traffic signal states are provided by an external API, updating at irregular intervals, adding a time-dependent aspect to the graph. Road conditions, like construction or accidents, also dynamically change the road segment weights. Unexpected events, such as detours or temporary road closures, can suddenly alter the graph structure. The vehicle must also be able to handle multiple destinations and prioritize them based on urgency.

You are tasked with implementing an efficient and robust pathfinding algorithm in Go that can handle these complexities.

Specifically, your solution must address the following:

1.  **Dynamic Graph Representation:** Implement a graph data structure capable of representing a city road network with weighted, directed edges. The graph must be mutable, allowing for real-time updates to edge weights and topology changes (addition/removal of nodes and edges).

2.  **Real-time Traffic Signal Integration:** Design a mechanism to fetch and integrate traffic signal state information from an external API. The signal states (e.g., "red", "green", "yellow") should dynamically influence the cost (travel time) of traversing an edge. Assume the API returns a map of intersection IDs to signal states.

3.  **Dynamic Road Condition Updates:** Implement a system to update road segment weights (travel times) based on real-time road condition data (e.g., traffic density, construction delays).

4.  **Unexpected Event Handling:** Develop a strategy to handle unexpected events like detours or temporary road closures, which may require modifying the graph structure on the fly.

5.  **Multi-Destination Optimization:** Extend the pathfinding algorithm to handle multiple destinations with assigned priorities. The algorithm should efficiently determine the optimal sequence of destinations to minimize the total travel time, respecting the priority constraints.

6.  **Traffic Law Compliance:** Incorporate a mechanism to ensure the generated paths comply with basic traffic laws, such as avoiding one-way streets in the wrong direction or making illegal turns.

7. **Performance Optimization:** The pathfinding algorithm must be optimized for performance, as real-time decision-making is critical. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithmic techniques to minimize search time. Large graphs with thousands of nodes and edges should be supported.

**Constraints:**

*   The city graph can have up to 10,000 intersections (nodes) and 50,000 road segments (edges).
*   Traffic signal states can change every 1-5 seconds.
*   Road conditions can update every 10-30 seconds.
*   The pathfinding algorithm must return a solution within 500 milliseconds.
*   Memory usage should be reasonable, avoiding excessive memory allocation.
*   The code should be well-structured, modular, and easy to maintain.

**Input:**

*   A graph representation of the city road network (e.g., an adjacency list or matrix).
*   A starting intersection ID.
*   A list of destination intersection IDs with associated priorities.
*   An external API endpoint for fetching traffic signal states.

**Output:**

*   An ordered list of intersection IDs representing the optimal path to visit all destinations in the specified order, considering priorities, traffic signals, road conditions, and traffic laws.
*   The total estimated travel time for the optimal path.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, real-time data integration, optimization techniques, and system design principles. The solution must be both efficient and robust to handle the dynamic and unpredictable nature of a real-world city environment. Different approaches with different trade-offs are possible.

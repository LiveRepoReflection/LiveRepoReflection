Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition.

**Problem Title: Scalable Order Matching Engine**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a scalable and efficient order matching engine for a cryptocurrency exchange. The engine needs to handle a high volume of concurrent buy and sell orders, match them based on price and time priority, and maintain a consistent and accurate order book.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Order Representation:** Define appropriate data structures to represent buy and sell orders. Each order should include:
    *   A unique order ID (UUID).
    *   The cryptocurrency pair (e.g., "BTC/USD").
    *   Order type (BUY or SELL).
    *   Price.
    *   Quantity.
    *   Timestamp (when the order was placed).

2.  **Order Book:** Implement an order book data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves buy and sell orders, grouped by price levels. Consider the trade-offs between different data structures (e.g., sorted lists, trees, heaps) for performance. You need to maintain separate order books for each cryptocurrency pair.

3.  **Matching Algorithm:** Implement a matching algorithm that prioritizes orders based on price and time. The engine should:
    *   Match buy orders with the lowest available sell orders (and vice versa).
    *   When multiple orders exist at the same price, prioritize the order placed earliest (FIFO - First-In, First-Out).
    *   Handle partial fills (when an order cannot be fully matched).
    *   Generate trade execution records when orders are matched, including the trade price, quantity, and involved order IDs.

4.  **Concurrency:** The engine must be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests (order placements and cancellations). Use Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) to achieve parallelism and avoid race conditions.

5.  **Order Cancellation:** Implement functionality to cancel existing orders by their order ID. Cancelling an order should remove it from the order book.

6.  **Market Order Support (Optional):** Add support for market orders. These orders are executed immediately at the best available price in the order book.

**Constraints & Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** The engine must be designed to handle a high volume of orders per second. Consider using techniques like sharding or load balancing to distribute the workload across multiple instances.
*   **Latency:** Minimizing latency is critical. Optimize the matching algorithm and data structures to ensure fast order processing.
*   **Accuracy:** The order book must be accurate and consistent at all times. Implement proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent data corruption in a concurrent environment.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid orders, network issues, and other unexpected events.
*   **Persistence (Optional):** Consider how you would persist the order book and trade history to a database or other storage system for recovery and analysis.
*   **Memory Management:** Pay attention to memory usage, especially when dealing with large order books. Use efficient data structures and avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the engine with various scenarios, including edge cases, high-volume loads, and concurrent operations.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the matching algorithm.
*   Performance (throughput and latency).
*   Scalability and concurrency handling.
*   Code quality and readability.
*   Error handling and robustness.
*   Adherence to the constraints.

This problem is deliberately open-ended to allow for creative solutions and different design choices. The challenge lies in balancing performance, scalability, accuracy, and code complexity. Good luck!

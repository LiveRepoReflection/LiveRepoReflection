Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, incorporating the elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `DistributedRateLimiter`

**Question Description:**

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service. This service needs to handle a high volume of requests from various clients across a distributed system and enforce rate limits based on different criteria.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Rate Limiting Criteria:** The rate limiter should support rate limiting based on:
    *   **Client ID:** Each client is identified by a unique string ID. Rate limits are applied per client.
    *   **API Endpoint:** Different API endpoints might have different rate limits. The endpoint is represented by a string.
    *   **Combined (Client ID, API Endpoint):** Rate limits can be defined specifically for a client accessing a specific API endpoint.

2.  **Rate Limit Definitions:** Rate limits are defined as a number of requests allowed within a specific time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour). The time window can be specified in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. The rate limits can be changed dynamically.

3.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter service must be horizontally scalable and able to handle requests from multiple servers in a distributed system. The service should maintain a consistent view of the rate limits and usage across all instances.

4.  **Concurrency and Performance:** The rate limiter must handle a high volume of concurrent requests with minimal latency. Avoid race conditions and ensure thread safety. Aim for optimal algorithmic efficiency.

5.  **Persistence:** The rate limiter must persist the rate limit configurations and current usage counts. The persistence layer should be pluggable, allowing for different storage options (e.g., Redis, Memcached, a custom in-memory store with persistence to disk). The solution should also handle failover of the persistence layer.

6.  **Atomic Operations:** Rate limiting operations (checking the limit and incrementing the counter) must be atomic to prevent exceeding the defined limits.

7.  **Dynamic Configuration:**  The system should allow for rate limits to be updated (added, modified, deleted) without service downtime. This includes changing the limit values and the time windows. The system must handle concurrent updates to the rate limits.

8.  **Exceeding Limits:** When a client exceeds the rate limit, the service should return an appropriate error code and a retry-after header indicating when the client can retry the request.

9.  **Resilience:** The system should be resilient to failures. If a particular rate limiter instance fails, other instances should be able to continue serving requests.

10. **Memory management:** The system should be optimized so as to not waste memory, and be designed to deal with big data in general.

**Constraints:**

*   You are free to use any external Go libraries, but justify your choices in terms of performance, reliability, and scalability.
*   Focus on the core rate limiting logic and the distributed coordination aspects. You don't need to implement a full-fledged API gateway.
*   Assume the clients are well-behaved and will respect the retry-after header.

**Deliverables:**

*   Go code implementing the rate limiter service.
*   Clear documentation explaining the architecture, design choices, and implementation details.
*   A brief analysis of the performance characteristics of your solution (e.g., expected throughput, latency).
*   Instructions on how to deploy and run the service in a distributed environment (e.g., using Docker and Kubernetes).

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, data structures, and algorithm optimization. It's a complex problem with many possible solutions and trade-offs, making it a good fit for a high-level programming competition. Good luck!

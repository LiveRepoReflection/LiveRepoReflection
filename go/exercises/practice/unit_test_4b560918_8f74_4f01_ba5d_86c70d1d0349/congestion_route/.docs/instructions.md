Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Go coding problem.  Here it is:

**Problem Title:**  Optimal Multi-Hop Route Planner with Congestion Awareness

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a route planner for a data network. The network consists of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.  Data packets need to be routed from a source node `S` to a destination node `D`.  However, instead of finding the shortest path based solely on distance, the route planner must also consider network congestion at each node.

The network's topology and congestion levels are provided as follows:

*   **Nodes:** Represented as an array of `N` nodes.
*   **Edges:** Represented as a list of directed edges. Each edge is defined as a tuple `(u, v, latency)`, where `u` is the source node, `v` is the destination node, and `latency` is the fixed latency of traversing that edge.
*   **Congestion:** Each node `i` has a congestion value `C[i]` representing the current load. This congestion value impacts the effective latency of traversing an edge *entering* that node. Specifically, when arriving at node `v`, the effective latency is increased by a factor of `(1 + C[v]/M)`, where `M` is a network-wide constant representing the maximum congestion level. The total latency of an edge `(u, v, latency)` becomes `latency * (1 + C[v]/M)`. Note that the congestion value of the source node `u` does *not* affect the latency of the edge `(u, v, latency)`.
*   **Maximum Hops:** The route can have at most `K` hops (traversed edges). A hop is defined as a traversal between two connected nodes.

Your goal is to find the route (sequence of nodes to traverse) from `S` to `D` that minimizes the *total effective latency*, considering both the fixed edge latencies and the congestion at the arrival node of each edge. If no route is possible within the given constraints, return an appropriate error indication. The latency must be an integer.

**Input:**

*   `N` (integer): The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges` (\[][]int): A 2D array representing the directed edges, where each inner array represents an edge: `[u, v, latency]`. `u` and `v` are integers representing the source and destination nodes, respectively, and `latency` is an integer representing the fixed latency of the edge.
*   `C` (\[]int): An array of integers representing the congestion level at each node.
*   `M` (integer): The maximum congestion level in the network.
*   `S` (integer): The source node.
*   `D` (integer): The destination node.
*   `K` (integer): The maximum number of hops allowed.

**Output:**

*   A list of integers representing the optimal route (sequence of nodes visited, starting with `S` and ending with `D`).
*   If no route is found within `K` hops, return an empty list.
*   If the source and destination nodes are the same, return a list containing only the source/destination node: `[S]`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `0 <= u, v < N` for each edge.
*   `1 <= latency <= 100` for each edge.
*   `0 <= C[i] <= M` for each node `i`.
*   `1 <= M <= 1000`
*   `0 <= S, D < N`
*   `1 <= K <= 10`
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Multiple edges may exist between two nodes (different latencies).
*   The solution must be efficient.  A naive brute-force approach will likely time out.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize the search.  Think about graph traversal techniques and how to incorporate the congestion factor.
*   Handle edge cases carefully (e.g., disconnected graph, no possible route within `K` hops, `S == D`).
*   The latency is an integer.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. It challenges the solver to consider a practical real-world scenario and to write efficient and robust code. Good luck!

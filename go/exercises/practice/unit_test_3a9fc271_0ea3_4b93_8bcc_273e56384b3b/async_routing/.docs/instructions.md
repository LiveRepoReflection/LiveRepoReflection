`Asynchronous Network Routing`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient and robust asynchronous network routing algorithm for a distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. Nodes communicate by sending messages to each other over a potentially unreliable network.

**Network Model:**

*   The network is modeled as a directed graph.
*   Each node knows its immediate neighbors (nodes it can directly send messages to). This information is provided as an adjacency list.
*   Messages may be lost or delayed. There is no guarantee of message delivery or order.
*   The network topology can change dynamically (nodes can join or leave, links can appear or disappear), but these changes occur relatively infrequently compared to the message routing frequency.
*   Each node has limited processing and memory resources.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Shortest Path Routing:** Implement a distributed algorithm that allows any node to find the shortest path (minimum number of hops) to any other node in the network, even with message loss and delays.

2.  **Asynchronous Operation:** Nodes should operate asynchronously. They should not rely on global synchronization or a central coordinator.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The algorithm should be resilient to message loss and node failures. The network should eventually converge to correct shortest paths even if some nodes crash or messages are dropped.

4.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be reasonably efficient in terms of message overhead and computation time. While optimality is not strictly required, strive to minimize unnecessary communication.

5.  **Dynamic Topology Adaptation:** The algorithm should adapt to changes in the network topology over time. After a change, the nodes should eventually update their routing information to reflect the new topology. You can assume topology changes are infrequent.

6.  **Scalability:** While tested on a relatively small network, the algorithm should be designed with scalability in mind. Avoid approaches that are inherently centralized or require excessive all-to-all communication.

7.  **Resource Constraints:** Be mindful of the limited processing and memory resources of each node. Avoid storing excessive routing information or performing computationally expensive operations.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `adjacency_list`: A slice of slices of integers, where `adjacency_list[i]` contains a list of the node IDs that node `i` can directly send messages to.
*   `source_node`: The ID of the node initiating the path finding.
*   `destination_node`: The ID of the node to find the path to.

**Output:**

*   A slice of integers representing the shortest path from `source_node` to `destination_node`. If no path exists, return an empty slice. The path should include the `source_node` as the first element and the `destination_node` as the last element.
*  The algorithm must converge within a reasonable time frame (e.g. 10 seconds) for networks up to 100 nodes, even with moderate message loss (e.g. 10%).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   Node IDs are integers from `0` to `N-1`.
*   The network may not be fully connected.
*   Message loss and delays are possible.
*   Network topology can change dynamically, but infrequently.

**Considerations:**

*   Consider using a variant of the Bellman-Ford algorithm or a distance-vector routing protocol, adapted for asynchronous operation and fault tolerance.
*   Think about how to handle message loss and delays. Techniques like sequence numbers, acknowledgements, or periodic updates might be useful.
*   Consider how to detect and respond to topology changes.
*   Think about data structures to store routing information efficiently.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed algorithms, graph theory, and network routing principles. It challenges the solver to design a robust and efficient solution that can handle the complexities of an asynchronous and unreliable network. Good luck!

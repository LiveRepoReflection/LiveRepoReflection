Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test various aspects of a programmer's skills, including data structures, algorithms, optimization, and handling real-world constraints.

## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Tiered Access

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a distributed rate limiter service. This service is responsible for controlling the rate at which users (identified by unique user IDs) can access a protected resource. The system needs to be highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient.

The rate limiter should support tiered access, meaning different users have different rate limits based on their subscription level (e.g., Free, Basic, Premium).  The rate limits are defined as the maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time window (e.g., 10 requests per minute for Free users).

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must be able to handle a high volume of requests across multiple servers.  Assume you have a cluster of rate limiter instances.

2.  **Tiered Rate Limits:** The system must support different rate limits for different user tiers. The tiers and their corresponding rate limits are configurable at runtime (e.g., read from a database or configuration file).  Assume the tier information is stored externally and accessible by the service.  The tiers might be updated frequently.

3.  **Atomic Increment:** The increment of the request count for a user within a time window must be atomic to prevent race conditions when multiple requests arrive simultaneously from different servers.

4.  **Time Window Management:** The system must accurately track requests within defined time windows (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours). Expired time windows should be automatically cleaned up to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to server failures. If a rate limiter instance goes down, the system should continue to function correctly.

6.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter should be highly efficient, minimizing latency and resource consumption.  Consider data structures and algorithms that offer optimal performance for frequent read and write operations.  Avoid unnecessary locking.

7.  **Configuration Updates:**  The rate limits for each tier can be updated dynamically. The system should be able to handle these updates with minimal disruption.

8.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing request loads.

**Input:**

The rate limiter receives requests in the form of `(userID string, tier string)`.

**Output:**

For each request, the rate limiter should return a boolean value: `true` if the request is allowed (i.e., the user has not exceeded their rate limit) and `false` if the request is rejected (i.e., the user has exceeded their rate limit).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of users can be very large (millions or billions).
*   The request rate can be very high (thousands or millions of requests per second).
*   The time windows can be short (e.g., 1 second).
*   Memory usage should be minimized.
*   Latency should be minimized (ideally single-digit milliseconds).
*   Consider the cost and complexity of different distributed data stores and algorithms.
*   Assume the tiers and rate limits are stored in a separate data store that can be accessed efficiently. Assume reads from this tier/rate limit store are much less frequent than request processing. The rate limit store provides an interface `GetRateLimit(tier string) (int, time.Duration, error)` which returns the request limit and time window duration for a given tier.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to handle "bursty" traffic patterns, allowing users to exceed their rate limit temporarily under certain conditions (e.g., using a token bucket algorithm).
*   Implement a mechanism to prevent "hot keys" (users who generate a disproportionately large number of requests) from overwhelming the system.

This problem is designed to be open-ended, allowing candidates to explore different design choices and trade-offs.  The key is to demonstrate a strong understanding of distributed systems, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency, all within the context of a practical real-world problem.  Good luck!

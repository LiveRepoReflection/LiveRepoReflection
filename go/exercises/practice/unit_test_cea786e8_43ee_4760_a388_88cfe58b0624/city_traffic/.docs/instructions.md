Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition.

**Project Name:** `CityTraffic`

**Question Description:**

A major city is represented as a network of intersections and roads. Each intersection is a node, and each road connecting two intersections is an edge. Due to increasing traffic, the city council wants to optimize traffic flow by strategically placing traffic lights at some intersections.

You are given:

*   `n`: The number of intersections in the city (numbered from 0 to n-1).
*   `roads`: A list of roads, where each road is represented as a tuple `(u, v, cost)`. `u` and `v` are the intersection IDs connected by the road, and `cost` is the estimated time (in minutes) it takes to travel along that road. The roads are bidirectional.
*   `lightCost`: The cost (in minutes) of waiting at a traffic light if one is encountered. This cost is only incurred when passing through an intersection *with* a traffic light.
*   `start`: The ID of the starting intersection.
*   `end`: The ID of the destination intersection.
*   `maxLights`: The maximum number of traffic lights the city council is willing to install. Installing more than this number is not feasible.

Your goal is to find the **minimum possible travel time** from the `start` intersection to the `end` intersection by placing at most `maxLights` traffic lights at some of the intersections (excluding the start and end intersections, these locations cannot have traffic lights).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100` (Number of intersections)
*   `0 <= len(roads) <= n * (n - 1) / 2` (Number of roads, no more than all combinations)
*   `0 <= u, v < n` (Valid intersection IDs)
*   `1 <= cost <= 100` (Time to travel a road)
*   `0 <= lightCost <= 100` (Time to wait at a traffic light)
*   `0 <= start, end < n` (Valid start and end intersection IDs)
*   `0 <= maxLights <= n - 2` (Maximum number of traffic lights allowed)
*   There is at least one path from the `start` intersection to the `end` intersection.
*   The road network is undirected and may not be fully connected.
*   There will be no self-loops (u != v for each road).
*   There will be at most one road between any two intersections.

**Challenge:**

The key challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of deciding where to place the traffic lights. A naive approach of trying all possible combinations will likely lead to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).  Efficient algorithms and data structures are needed to explore the solution space effectively. Think about how to prune the search space and avoid redundant calculations. Consider using graph algorithms combined with optimization techniques like dynamic programming or informed search (e.g., A*).  The optimal solution might require careful consideration of the trade-off between road travel time and the cost of waiting at traffic lights.

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a programmer's understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, optimization, and system design considerations.

**Project Title:** Distributed Transaction Validator

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a distributed system where transactions are processed across multiple nodes. Each transaction involves a set of resources (identified by unique string IDs) and a set of nodes (identified by unique string IDs) responsible for managing those resources. A transaction is considered valid if and only if all resources it uses are consistently managed across the involved nodes.

Specifically, you are given a stream of transaction records. Each transaction record contains the following information:

*   `TransactionID`: A unique string identifier for the transaction.
*   `Resources`: A list of string IDs representing the resources involved in the transaction.
*   `Nodes`: A list of string IDs representing the nodes participating in the transaction.

You are also given a stream of resource state updates. Each update contains the following information:

*   `ResourceID`: The string ID of the resource being updated.
*   `NodeID`: The string ID of the node where the resource state is being updated.
*   `StateVersion`: An integer representing the version of the resource's state on that node. Higher `StateVersion` indicates a more recent state.

Your task is to build a system that validates the incoming transactions against the resource state updates. The system should maintain the latest state version of each resource on each node. When a transaction arrives, it should check if all resources involved in the transaction have the same latest `StateVersion` on all nodes involved in the transaction.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of transactions and resource state updates (millions or billions).
2.  **Real-time Validation:** The validation should be as close to real-time as possible.  There will be a latency requirement.  The system should aim for average validation latency under 100ms.
3.  **Concurrency:** The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent updates and validation requests efficiently.
4.  **Memory Efficiency:** The system should minimize memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of resources and nodes. Consider data structures carefully.
5.  **Eventual Consistency:**  It's acceptable to return a potentially incorrect validation result in rare cases immediately after a state update. However, the system must eventually converge to a consistent state, meaning if the same transaction is validated again later, it should produce the correct result.
6.  **Resource Ownership:** Assume that each resource is only managed by the nodes specified in the transaction record for that resource, and all nodes listed in a transaction record *do* manage all the resources in that transaction.  This constraint simplifies the data structure requirements but the core algorithm is still complex.
7.  **Idempotency:** The validation process does not need to be strictly idempotent (i.e., running the validation twice on the same transaction can have side effects).

**Input:**

The system will receive two separate streams of data:

*   **Transaction Stream:** A continuous stream of `TransactionRecord` structs.
*   **Resource State Update Stream:** A continuous stream of `ResourceStateUpdate` structs.

**Output:**

For each transaction received, the system must output a `ValidationResult` struct indicating whether the transaction is valid or invalid.

**Struct Definitions (Go):**

```go
type TransactionRecord struct {
	TransactionID string
	Resources     []string
	Nodes         []string
}

type ResourceStateUpdate struct {
	ResourceID    string
	NodeID        string
	StateVersion  int
}

type ValidationResult struct {
	TransactionID string
	IsValid       bool
}
```

**High-Level Expectations:**

The solution should focus on:

*   Efficient storage and retrieval of resource state versions.
*   Minimizing the time required to validate a transaction.
*   Handling concurrency and large-scale data.
*   Demonstrating an understanding of eventual consistency principles.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures (e.g., concurrent maps, possibly specialized trees or Bloom filters for optimization), concurrency control (e.g., mutexes, channels), and algorithmic optimization to meet the performance requirements. Good luck!

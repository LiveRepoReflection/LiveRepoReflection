Okay, here's a challenging code problem for a Go programming competition.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkPlacement`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing the core infrastructure for a new, massively distributed content delivery network (CDN).  The network consists of a set of interconnected nodes.  Each node has a limited storage capacity and processing power.  You need to strategically place content replicas across these nodes to minimize the average latency for content requests from users.

The network is represented as an undirected, weighted graph. Nodes are represented by integers from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the total number of nodes. The weight of an edge between two nodes represents the latency of transferring data between them. There may be multiple edges between nodes.

You are given:

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges`: A list of edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(node1, node2, latency)`.
*   `storageCapacity`: An array of integers of length `n`, where `storageCapacity[i]` represents the storage capacity of node `i`.
*   `requestFrequencies`: A 2D array of integers representing the frequency of requests for specific content. `requestFrequencies[i][0]` represents the node requesting the content and `requestFrequencies[i][1]` represents the frequency of requests originating from that node. Assume that all requests are for the same content, but come from different locations.
*   `contentSize`: The size of the content that needs to be replicated (in the same units as `storageCapacity`).
*   `maxReplicas`: The maximum number of content replicas you can place in the network.

**Your Task:**

Write a function that determines the optimal placement of content replicas on the nodes of the network such that the average latency for content requests is minimized. The function should return a list of node indices representing the nodes where the content replicas should be placed.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= edges.length <= 10000`
*   `0 <= node1, node2 < n`
*   `1 <= latency <= 100`
*   `1 <= storageCapacity[i] <= 1000`
*   `1 <= requestFrequencies[i][1] <= 100`
*   `1 <= contentSize <= 500`
*   `1 <= maxReplicas <= n`
*   The total storage capacity of all nodes is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `contentSize * maxReplicas`

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The algorithm must be efficient.  A naive brute-force approach will likely time out. Consider using techniques such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or approximation algorithms. The goal is to minimize execution time.
*   The solution must also be space-efficient. Avoid creating large, unnecessary data structures.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph might not be fully connected.
*   Multiple nodes might have the same storage capacity or request frequency.
*   The optimal solution might involve placing replicas on nodes with low request frequencies.
*   Some nodes might not have enough storage to hold the content.

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on two factors:

1.  **Correctness:**  The returned list of nodes must represent a valid placement (i.e., each node in the list has sufficient storage capacity, and the number of nodes in the list does not exceed `maxReplicas`). The average latency must be calculated correctly.
2.  **Efficiency:** The average latency achieved by your solution will be compared to the average latency of other solutions.  Solutions with lower average latency will receive higher scores.  Execution time will also be considered.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be written in Go.
*   Your solution should be well-documented, explaining the algorithm used and the rationale behind your design choices.

**Example (Illustrative - may not be optimal):**

```
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 10], [0, 2, 15], [1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 20], [2, 4, 10], [3, 4, 5]]
storageCapacity = [600, 700, 800, 900, 1000]
requestFrequencies = [[0, 50], [1, 60], [2, 70], [3, 80], [4, 90]]
contentSize = 500
maxReplicas = 2

Output: [2, 3] // Placing replicas on nodes 2 and 3 might (or might not) be optimal.
```

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (finding shortest paths), optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints and edge cases. Good luck!

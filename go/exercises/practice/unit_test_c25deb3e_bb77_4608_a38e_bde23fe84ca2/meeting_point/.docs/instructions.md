Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at LeetCode Hard level, focusing on graph traversal and optimization.

Optimal-Meeting-Point

### Question Description

Imagine a city represented as a weighted, undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents a location, and each edge represents a road connecting two locations, with the weight of the edge representing the travel time between those locations.

A group of friends lives in different locations within this city. They want to find the optimal meeting point â€“ the location that minimizes the *maximum* travel time any one of them has to travel to reach it.

**Specifically:**

Given:

*   `n`: The number of locations in the city (nodes in the graph), numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `edges`: A list of edges, where each edge is represented as `[u, v, weight]`, indicating a road between locations `u` and `v` with travel time `weight`.
*   `friends`: A list of the locations where the friends live.

You need to find the location that minimizes the *maximum* distance from any friend to that location. In other words, if `d(i, j)` is the shortest travel time between location `i` and `j`, and `meeting_point` is a location, you want to minimize:

`max(d(friend1, meeting_point), d(friend2, meeting_point), ..., d(friendK, meeting_point))`

where `friend1`, `friend2`, ..., `friendK` are the locations of the friends.

Return the index of the optimal meeting point (a location in the city). If there are multiple optimal locations (i.e., multiple locations that result in the same minimal maximum distance), return the location with the smallest index.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= edges.length <= n*(n-1)/2` (sparse graph)
*   `edges[i].length == 3`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= weight <= 1000`
*   There are no self-loops or duplicate edges.
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   `1 <= friends.length <= n`
*   All values in `friends` are unique and valid location indices.
*   The code should be efficient enough to solve the problem within a reasonable time limit (e.g., using Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall). The solution is expected to be O(N^3) or better.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Consider the case where a friend's location is itself the optimal meeting point.
*   Handle the case where there is only one friend.
*   Consider cases with a larger number of locations and edges to test scalability.

This problem requires understanding graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases, making it a challenging and sophisticated Go coding problem.

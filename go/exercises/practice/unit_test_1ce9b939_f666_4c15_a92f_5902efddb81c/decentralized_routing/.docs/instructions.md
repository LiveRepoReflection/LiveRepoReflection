## Problem: Decentralized Social Network Routing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a new decentralized social network. This network differs from traditional centralized platforms in that user data and connections are distributed across numerous independent servers ("nodes"). Users can follow other users, and the goal is to efficiently deliver messages (posts) from a user to all of their followers.

The network has the following characteristics:

*   **Decentralized Graph:** The social network is represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents a server, and edges represent the known connections between servers. A server *knows* about another server if it has a direct connection (edge) to it. The entire graph may not be known to any single server.
*   **User Distribution:** Users and their follower lists are distributed randomly and independently across the servers. A single server can host any number of users and followers. A user's followers can reside on any server in the network.
*   **Message Propagation:** When a user posts a message, it needs to be propagated to all servers hosting their followers. The challenge lies in doing this efficiently, minimizing redundant message transmissions and latency.
*   **Server Capacity:** Each server has limited bandwidth and processing capacity. Sending the same message to the same server multiple times, or engaging in excessive broadcasting, can overload the network.
*   **Dynamic Network:** Servers can join or leave the network at any time. Connections between servers can also be added or removed. Your routing algorithm must be robust to these changes.
*   **Eventual Consistency:** It is acceptable for messages to be delivered with some delay (eventual consistency). The primary goal is to ensure that all followers *eventually* receive the message, without overwhelming the network.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Implement a `RouteMessage` function that takes the following inputs:**
    *   `originServerID`: The ID of the server where the message originates.
    *   `userID`: The ID of the user who posted the message.
    *   `message`: The content of the message.
    *   `networkState`: A snapshot of the current network state. This will include information about:
        *   Available Servers (IDs and connectivity to other servers)
        *   User locations (which server hosts each user)
        *   Follower lists (which users follow which other users, and on what server that relationship is stored)

2.  **The `RouteMessage` function should determine the optimal route(s) for the message to reach all servers hosting the followers of `userID`.** "Optimal" is defined as minimizing the total number of message transmissions across the network, while ensuring eventual delivery to all followers. You must take into consideration network topology and server load.

3.  **Your solution should handle the following edge cases:**
    *   The origin server not having direct connections to all servers hosting followers.
    *   Network partitions (where some servers are unreachable from others). Your solution should still attempt to deliver messages to reachable followers.
    *   Users with a very large number of followers (influencers).
    *   Users with no followers.
    *   Network changes occurring while a message is being routed.
    *   Cycles in the server connections.

4.  **Your solution must be efficient.**  Consider the time and space complexity of your routing algorithm, especially as the network size grows. Aim for a solution that scales well to a large number of servers and users.

5.  **You are free to use any data structures and algorithms you deem appropriate.** Consider techniques such as:
    *   Distributed Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm (adapted for a distributed environment)
    *   Bloom filters to avoid redundant message transmissions
    *   Gossip protocols for network discovery and resilience
    *   Caching of routing information

6.  **Assume a reliable underlying transport layer.** You do not need to handle message loss or corruption.

**Constraints:**

*   The network can contain up to 10,000 servers.
*   Each server can host up to 1,000,000 users.
*   A user can have up to 1,000,000 followers.
*   Message size is limited to 1KB.
*   Servers have limited bandwidth (simulate this by penalizing high numbers of message transmissions).
*   The evaluation metric will consider:
    *   **Message Delivery Rate:** Percentage of followers who receive the message.
    *   **Total Message Transmissions:** Number of messages sent across the network.
    *   **Latency:** Simulated time for message delivery.
    *   **Scalability:** Performance with increasing network size.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, graph algorithms, and optimization techniques. The challenge lies in designing a routing algorithm that is both efficient and robust in a dynamic and decentralized environment. Good luck!

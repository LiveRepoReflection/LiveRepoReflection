## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication in a Microservice Architecture

### Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing the communication between microservices in a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` microservices, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. These microservices communicate with each other by sending requests and receiving responses.

However, the network infrastructure is unreliable, and connections between microservices can exhibit varying latencies and packet loss. To mitigate these issues, you need to implement an intelligent routing mechanism that minimizes the expected communication time between any two microservices.

The communication time between two microservices `i` and `j` is affected by two factors:

1.  **Direct Connection Latency:** The inherent latency of a direct connection between microservices `i` and `j`. This is represented by a matrix `latency[i][j]`, where `latency[i][j]` is the latency (in milliseconds) of sending a request directly from microservice `i` to microservice `j`.  If there is no direct connection, `latency[i][j] = -1`. Note that `latency[i][j]` may not be equal to `latency[j][i]`.

2.  **Intermediate Service Overhead:** If a request is routed through intermediate microservices, each intermediate service adds a fixed overhead of `K` milliseconds to the total communication time. This overhead represents the time spent on request processing, serialization/deserialization, and other internal operations within the intermediate service.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the number of microservices `N`, the latency matrix `latency`, the intermediate service overhead `K`, and a source microservice `source` and a destination microservice `destination`, finds the **minimum expected communication time** to send a request from `source` to `destination`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of microservices. `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `latency`: A 2D array (matrix) of integers of size `N x N` representing the direct connection latencies between microservices. `latency[i][j]` is the latency from microservice `i` to microservice `j`.  `-1 <= latency[i][j] <= 1000`. `latency[i][i] = 0` for all `i`.
*   `K`: An integer representing the overhead (in milliseconds) added by each intermediate service. `1 <= K <= 100`
*   `source`: An integer representing the ID of the source microservice. `0 <= source < N`
*   `destination`: An integer representing the ID of the destination microservice. `0 <= destination < N`

**Output:**

*   An integer representing the minimum expected communication time (in milliseconds) from the `source` to the `destination` microservice.  If there is no possible route from the source to the destination, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be efficient. A brute-force approach that explores all possible paths will likely result in timeouts for larger inputs.
*   Consider the case where direct connections are significantly slower than routing through several intermediate services.
*   The path can contain up to `N-2` intermediate microservices.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
latency = [
    [0, 50, -1, -1],
    [-1, 0, 20, 100],
    [-1, -1, 0, 30],
    [-1, -1, -1, 0]
]
K = 10
source = 0
destination = 3

Output: 90

Explanation:
- Direct path (0 -> 3): Not possible (latency[0][3] = -1).
- Path 0 -> 1 -> 3: 50 (0->1) + 100 (1->3) + 10 (intermediate service 1) = 160
- Path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3: 50 (0->1) + 20 (1->2) + 30 (2->3) + 2 * 10 (intermediate services 1 and 2) = 130

The optimal path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 with a total communication time of 130.

```

```
N = 3
latency = [
    [0, 50, 90],
    [50, 0, 10],
    [90, 10, 0]
]
K = 5
source = 0
destination = 2

Output: 60

Explanation:
- Direct path (0 -> 2): 90
- Path 0 -> 1 -> 2: 50 + 10 + 5 = 65
The optimal path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a total communication time of 65.
```

**Think about:**

*   How to represent the network of microservices as a graph?
*   Which graph algorithms are suitable for finding the shortest path with the added overhead constraint?
*   How to handle cases where there's no path between the source and destination?
*   How to optimize the algorithm for efficiency, especially with larger values of `N`?

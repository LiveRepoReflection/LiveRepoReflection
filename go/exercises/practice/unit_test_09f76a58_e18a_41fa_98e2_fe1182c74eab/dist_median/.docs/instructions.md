Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

## Project Name

`DistributedMedian`

## Question Description

You are building a distributed system to process massive amounts of numerical data.  The data is partitioned across `N` worker nodes.  Each worker node holds a sorted list of integers.  Your task is to efficiently determine the *median* of the *entire* dataset, without centralizing all the data on a single node.

Specifically:

1.  **Input:** Each worker node `i` (where `0 <= i < N`) holds a sorted slice of `int64` named `data[i]`. The number of worker nodes, `N`, can be very large (up to 10<sup>6</sup>). The size of `data[i]` on each node can also be very large (up to 10<sup>6</sup>). The values are non-negative. All workers are independent and have no shared memory.

2.  **Communication:** You can simulate communication between the nodes by using channels.  The communication cost (number of messages sent) should be minimized.  You should aim for an algorithm with logarithmic communication complexity relative to N.

3.  **Median Definition:** The median is defined as follows:
    *   If the total number of integers across all worker nodes is odd, the median is the middle element after sorting all integers.
    *   If the total number of integers across all worker nodes is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements after sorting all integers.

4.  **Constraints:**
    *   **Memory Limit:** Each worker node has limited memory. You cannot load the entire dataset into the memory of a single node.  Specifically, no node should allocate memory proportional to the entire dataset.
    *   **Time Limit:** The solution must be efficient.  Naive solutions that involve transferring all data to a central node will time out.
    *   **Communication Cost:** Minimize the number of messages exchanged between worker nodes. Solutions that require each node to communicate with every other node are discouraged.
    *   **N can be very large.** Your solution should scale well with the number of worker nodes.

5.  **Output:** The function should return the median as a `float64`.

6.  **Function Signature:**

```go
func DistributedMedian(data [][]int64) float64 {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

**Challenge:**

*   Design an algorithm that efficiently finds the median in a distributed manner while respecting the memory, time, and communication constraints.  Consider using binary search or similar techniques to efficiently narrow down the range of possible median values.

*   Handle edge cases such as empty datasets, datasets with duplicate values, and datasets where the median falls between two integers.

*   Ensure that your solution is robust and handles large datasets gracefully.

This problem requires you to think about distributed algorithms, optimization, and handling large datasets, making it a challenging and sophisticated task. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed with complexity and optimization in mind.

**Project Name:** `NetworkFlowScheduler`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a scheduler for a network flow problem.  The network consists of `n` nodes (numbered 0 to `n-1`) and `m` directed edges. Each edge `i` has a capacity `c_i` and a current flow `f_i` (initially 0). You are given a set of `k` flow requests. Each flow request `j` is defined by a source node `s_j`, a target node `t_j`, and a requested flow amount `r_j`.

Your scheduler must determine the *maximum number of flow requests* that can be *simultaneously satisfied* without violating any edge capacities. A flow request is considered satisfied if a path can be found from its source to its target node such that the flow `r_j` can be pushed along that path.  Note that multiple flow requests can share the same edges, and the total flow on each edge must never exceed its capacity.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Input Format:** The input will be provided as follows:

    *   `n`: Number of nodes (2 <= `n` <= 100)
    *   `m`: Number of edges (1 <= `m` <= 500)
    *   A list of `m` edges, where each edge is represented by a tuple `(u_i, v_i, c_i)`:
        *   `u_i`: Source node of edge `i` (0 <= `u_i` < `n`)
        *   `v_i`: Target node of edge `i` (0 <= `v_i` < `n`)
        *   `c_i`: Capacity of edge `i` (1 <= `c_i` <= 1000)
    *   `k`: Number of flow requests (1 <= `k` <= 30)
    *   A list of `k` flow requests, where each request is represented by a tuple `(s_j, t_j, r_j)`:
        *   `s_j`: Source node of request `j` (0 <= `s_j` < `n`)
        *   `t_j`: Target node of request `j` (0 <= `t_j` < `n`)
        *   `r_j`: Requested flow amount for request `j` (1 <= `r_j` <= 100)

2.  **Output Format:** The output should be a single integer representing the maximum number of flow requests that can be simultaneously satisfied.

3.  **Optimization:**  The solution must be efficient.  A naive approach of trying all possible subsets of flow requests will likely time out. Consider using dynamic programming, graph algorithms, or other optimization techniques.

4.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   The network may not be fully connected.
    *   A flow request's source and target nodes may be the same.
    *   There may be no path between a flow request's source and target nodes.
    *   Multiple edges may exist between the same pair of nodes.
    *   The requested flow amount for a request may be larger than the capacity of any single path between its source and target.

5. **Real-world Consideration**: This problem has real-world application in network management, resource allocation, and logistics.

**Example:**

```
n = 4
m = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 7), (2, 3, 6)]
k = 3
requests = [(0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 3), (1, 3, 2)]
```

In this example, you can satisfy all three requests:

* Request 1 (0, 3, 5): Flow can go through path 0->1->3 (5 units)
* Request 2 (0, 3, 3): Flow can go through path 0->2->3 (3 units)
* Request 3 (1, 3, 2): Flow can go through path 1->3 (2 units)

So the output should be `3`.

**Challenge:**

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, flow network understanding, and optimization techniques to arrive at a correct and efficient solution.  The relatively small constraints still permit the need for careful consideration on algorithm choices and data structures to ensure the best possible performance. This problem can be solved in several ways and requires the solver to consider trade-offs between different approaches.

Good luck!

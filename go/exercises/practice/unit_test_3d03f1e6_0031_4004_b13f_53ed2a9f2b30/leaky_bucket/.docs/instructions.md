## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Leaky Bucket

**Project Name:** `distributed-leaky-bucket`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter using the Leaky Bucket algorithm. This rate limiter will be used to protect a critical service from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a popular online payment gateway. You need to protect your API endpoints from abuse, such as denial-of-service attacks or malicious bots attempting to brute-force payment processing. You need a robust and scalable rate limiting solution. Your payment gateway is deployed across multiple servers.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed:** The rate limiter must work correctly across multiple instances of your service.  Requests from the same user (identified by a unique `userID`) across different servers should be subject to the same rate limit.

2.  **Leaky Bucket Algorithm:** Implement the rate limiting logic using the Leaky Bucket algorithm. The bucket has a fixed capacity, and requests "fill" the bucket. The bucket "leaks" at a constant rate, allowing requests to be processed.  If a request would cause the bucket to overflow, it is rejected.

3.  **Configuration:** The rate limiter should be configurable with the following parameters:
    *   `capacity`: The maximum number of requests allowed in the bucket.
    *   `leakRate`: The number of requests that can be processed per second.
    *   `userID`: A unique identifier for the user (e.g., a UUID).

4.  **Persistence:** The state of the leaky buckets (current water level) needs to be persisted to a shared storage system.  Consider using a distributed key-value store like Redis to store bucket state across all servers.  You are responsible for ensuring data consistency.

5.  **Concurrency:**  The rate limiter must handle concurrent requests from multiple users and servers safely.

6.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiting logic should be as efficient as possible to minimize latency.  Consider the trade-offs between accuracy and performance.

7.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and logging.

8.  **Atomicity:**  Implement a mechanism to ensure the operations of reading the bucket level, incrementing, and writing back are done atomically to avoid race conditions.

**Constraints:**

*   The system must be able to handle a high volume of requests (e.g., thousands per second).
*   The latency introduced by the rate limiter should be minimal (e.g., less than 5 milliseconds on average).
*   The solution should be resilient to failures in the distributed key-value store. Consider strategies for handling temporary outages.
*   You should consider how the `leakRate` interacts with the time resolution of your system. If the leak rate is very low, and the time since the last leak is short, you could face issues with integer truncation.
*   The `userID` can be any string. Ensure your solution handles arbitrary string lengths efficiently.
*   Assume that clock synchronization between servers is not guaranteed.

**Function Signature:**

```go
// AllowRequest determines if a request from the given user should be allowed based on the leaky bucket algorithm.
// It returns true if the request is allowed, false otherwise.
// userID is a unique identifier for the user.
// capacity is the maximum number of requests allowed in the bucket.
// leakRate is the number of requests that can be processed per second.
func AllowRequest(userID string, capacity int, leakRate float64) bool {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   Explore different data structures and algorithms for implementing the leaky bucket.
*   Evaluate the trade-offs between different persistence strategies.
*   Consider the impact of clock drift and network latency on the accuracy of the rate limiter.
*   How would you handle a sudden surge in traffic?
*   How would you monitor the performance of the rate limiter?

This problem requires careful consideration of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. A well-designed solution will be scalable, reliable, and performant. Good luck!

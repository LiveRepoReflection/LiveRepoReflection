## Question: Distributed Transaction Orchestrator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction orchestrator. In a microservices architecture, ensuring data consistency across multiple services during a single logical operation (transaction) is crucial. This problem simulates a simplified scenario where you need to coordinate updates across several storage nodes to maintain atomicity.

Imagine you have a system composed of `N` storage nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. Each node can perform two operations: `Prepare` and `Commit`.

*   **Prepare(transactionID, data):** The node attempts to tentatively apply a given data update associated with a specific transaction ID. If successful (e.g., the node has sufficient resources, the data is valid, and no conflicting transaction is in progress), the node reserves the necessary resources and returns `true`. If unsuccessful, the node returns `false`, indicating it cannot participate in the transaction.

*   **Commit(transactionID):** The node permanently applies the data update associated with the given transaction ID, releasing any reserved resources. This operation should always succeed if `Prepare` was successful.

Your task is to implement a function `OrchestrateTransaction` that takes the following inputs:

1.  `N`: The number of storage nodes.
2.  `prepareFunctions`: A slice of functions, where `prepareFunctions[i]` is a function representing the `Prepare` operation for node `i`. Each function should accept a `transactionID` (int) and `data` (string) and return a boolean indicating success or failure.
3.  `commitFunctions`: A slice of functions, where `commitFunctions[i]` is a function representing the `Commit` operation for node `i`. Each function should accept a `transactionID` (int) and return nothing.
4.  `transactionID`: A unique identifier for the transaction (int).
5.  `data`: The data to be applied during the transaction (string).

The `OrchestrateTransaction` function must implement a **two-phase commit (2PC)** protocol to ensure atomicity. The function should return `true` if the transaction was successfully committed across all nodes, and `false` if the transaction was rolled back due to a failure at any node.

**Constraints:**

*   **Atomicity:** Either all nodes commit the transaction, or none do. If any `Prepare` operation fails, the transaction must be rolled back, meaning no changes should persist.
*   **Concurrency:** Assume the `Prepare` and `Commit` operations on individual nodes are thread-safe. However, your orchestrator might need to handle concurrent transaction requests.
*   **Failure Handling:** If a `Prepare` operation fails, the orchestrator must ensure that all nodes that successfully prepared the transaction are rolled back (i.e., their reserved resources are released).
*   **Idempotency (Important):** While the provided functions are guaranteed to succeed if called correctly within the 2PC protocol, consider the possibility of network issues or other unforeseen errors causing the orchestrator to retry the `Prepare` or `Commit` operations.  Ensure your solution handles potential duplicate calls gracefully *without* causing data corruption or resource leaks. Specifically, the `Prepare` function might be called multiple times with the same transaction ID and data for the same node. The `Commit` function might also be called multiple times with the same transaction ID for the same node. Your code should gracefully handle these duplicate calls as if they only happened once.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:**  The `Prepare` operations should be executed concurrently to minimize the overall transaction latency. However, the `Commit` operations must only be executed if *all* `Prepare` operations were successful.
*   **Efficiency:** Minimize the overhead of the orchestration process.

**Real-World Practical Scenarios:**

This problem is a simplified version of coordinating database updates, coordinating resource allocation in distributed systems, or ensuring consistency in financial transactions across multiple banks.

**System Design Aspects:**

Consider how your solution would scale to a large number of nodes. How would you handle node failures during the commit phase? (While you don't need to implement fault tolerance explicitly, think about the implications).

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

The solution should strive for optimal performance. In a large-scale system, the latency of the transaction orchestration is critical.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

There are several ways to implement the 2PC protocol.  The choice of approach can influence the complexity and performance of your solution.  Consider using channels, goroutines, mutexes or other concurrency primitives effectively.  Think about different strategies for handling rollbacks and potential error conditions.

## Question: Distributed Task Scheduler with Deadlock Detection

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed task scheduler. The scheduler is responsible for managing and executing tasks across a cluster of worker nodes.  Tasks can have dependencies on each other, meaning a task can only start execution after its dependencies have completed successfully.

Each task is uniquely identified by an integer `taskID`. The scheduler receives task submissions in the form of `(taskID, dependencies)`, where `dependencies` is a list of `taskID`s that must be completed before the task with `taskID` can start.

The scheduler must ensure the following:

1.  **Dependency Resolution:**  Tasks are executed only after all their dependencies are met.
2.  **Deadlock Detection:** The scheduler must detect and report deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when a set of tasks are mutually dependent on each other, preventing any of them from starting.  The scheduler should return a list of `taskID`s involved in the deadlock cycle if one is detected.  If multiple deadlocks exist, return *any* one of them.
3.  **Resource Management:**  Assume each task requires a single resource unit. The cluster has a limited number of resource units, `capacity`.  The scheduler can only execute up to `capacity` tasks concurrently.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** If a worker node fails while executing a task, the scheduler should reschedule the task on another available worker node. For simplicity, assume that any task can be retried indefinitely. The number of retries are not concerned in the current question.
5.  **Scalability:**  The scheduler should be designed to handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes. However, for this problem, focus on algorithmic efficiency and correctness, assuming a reasonable number of tasks (up to 10,000) and worker nodes.
6. **Deterministic Behavior**: When deadlock is detected, you must return all `taskID`s involved in the smallest cycle. If multiple smallest cycles exist, return the lexicographically smallest one.

**Input:**

*   `tasks`: A list of task submissions. Each task submission is a tuple `(taskID, dependencies)`, where `taskID` is an integer and `dependencies` is a list of integers representing the `taskID`s of the task's dependencies.
*   `capacity`: An integer representing the maximum number of tasks that can be executed concurrently.

**Output:**

*   If a deadlock is detected, return a sorted list of `taskID`s involved in *any* deadlock cycle (lexicographically smallest one if multiple minimal cycles exist).
*   If all tasks can be scheduled without deadlocks, return an empty list `[]`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= number of tasks <= 10,000`
*   `1 <= capacity <= 100`
*   `1 <= taskID <= 10,000`
*   TaskIDs are unique.
*   Dependencies of a task will not include the task itself.

**Example:**

```
tasks = [(1, [2]), (2, [3]), (3, [1])]
capacity = 1

Output: [1, 2, 3]  // A deadlock cycle exists between tasks 1, 2, and 3.

tasks = [(1, []), (2, [1]), (3, [2])]
capacity = 1

Output: [] // No deadlock. Tasks can be scheduled in the order 1, 2, 3.

tasks = [(1, [2,3]), (2, []), (3, [])]
capacity = 1

Output: [] // No deadlock. Tasks can be scheduled in the order 2, 3, 1.

tasks = [(1, [2]), (2, [1]), (3, [4]), (4, [3]), (5, [])]
capacity = 1

Output: [1, 2]  // A deadlock cycle exists between tasks 1 and 2.  Although there is a cycle between 3 and 4, the cycle [1,2] has smaller taskIDs.

tasks = [(1, [2]), (2, [1]), (3, [1,2]), (4, [])]
capacity = 2

Output: [1, 2] // deadlock between 1 and 2 still

tasks = [(1, [2]), (2, [1]), (3, [4]), (4, [3]), (5, [1,2,3,4])]
capacity = 2
Output: [1, 2]

tasks = [(1, [2]), (2, [3]), (3, [4]), (4, [2])]
capacity = 2
Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

**Clarifications (Implicit):**

*   The problem is about *detecting* deadlocks, not necessarily resolving them in the most optimal way. You just need to report *one* deadlock cycle if it exists.
*   You don't need to simulate the actual execution of the tasks. Just determine if a valid schedule is possible or if a deadlock exists.
*   Assume the input `tasks` is well-formed and doesn't contain invalid task IDs (i.e., task IDs not within the allowed range).
*   The order of tasks in the `tasks` list does not imply any scheduling priority.

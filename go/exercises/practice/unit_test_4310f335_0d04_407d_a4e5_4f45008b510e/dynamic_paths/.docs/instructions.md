## Question Title:  Optimized Multi-Source Shortest Paths in a Dynamic Road Network

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a highly efficient system for calculating shortest paths in a dynamic road network.  The road network is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments.  Each road segment has a travel time associated with it.  The travel time for each road segment can change dynamically due to traffic conditions, road closures, or other unforeseen events.

Your system must support the following operations:

1.  **`UpdateEdge(u, v, new_travel_time)`:** Updates the travel time of the road segment from intersection `u` to intersection `v` to `new_travel_time`. If the edge `(u, v)` does not exist, it should be created with the given `new_travel_time`. If the edge `(u, v)` exists, and `new_travel_time` is negative, the edge should be removed from the graph.
2.  **`QueryShortestPath(sources, destination)`:**  Given a list of `sources` (starting intersections) and a `destination` intersection, find the shortest path from *any* of the `sources` to the `destination`. Return the length of the shortest path. If no path exists from any of the sources to the destination, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Graph Size:** The road network can be large, containing up to 10<sup>5</sup> intersections and 10<sup>6</sup> road segments.
*   **Real-time Performance:**  Both `UpdateEdge` and `QueryShortestPath` operations must be performed very quickly.  The system should be optimized for minimizing the latency of each operation.  Assume that there will be a high volume of both update and query requests.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** The travel times of road segments change frequently. Your solution must efficiently handle these updates without requiring a complete recomputation of shortest paths after every change.
*   **Multiple Sources:** The `QueryShortestPath` operation must efficiently handle cases where there are multiple possible starting points (sources). The number of sources in a single query can be up to 10<sup>3</sup>.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the graph is disconnected, where the source or destination node does not exist, or where there are negative travel times (after an edge is updated).  Negative travel times are not allowed.
*   **Memory Usage:** Minimize memory usage, as the system will run on resource-constrained devices.
*   **Concurrency:** Your code should be thread-safe. Multiple `UpdateEdge` and `QueryShortestPath` operations might be called concurrently from different goroutines.

**Input:**

*   The graph is initially empty.
*   `u`, `v`, `destination`, and elements within the `sources` list are integers representing intersection IDs.
*   `new_travel_time` is a non-negative integer representing the travel time (or -1 to remove the edge).

**Output:**

*   `QueryShortestPath` should return an integer representing the length of the shortest path, or `-1` if no path exists.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about how to represent the graph data structure efficiently.
*   Consider which shortest path algorithms are suitable for this dynamic scenario.  Can you adapt existing algorithms or combine multiple algorithms to meet the performance requirements?
*   How can you efficiently handle updates to the graph without recomputing everything from scratch?
*   How will you ensure thread safety?
*   Think about the trade-offs between memory usage and performance.

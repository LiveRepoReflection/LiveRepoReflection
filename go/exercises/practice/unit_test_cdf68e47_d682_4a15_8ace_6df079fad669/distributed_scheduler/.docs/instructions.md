Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Go programming competition problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Distributed Task Scheduler with Fault Tolerance

### Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed task scheduler in Go. This scheduler will receive tasks, distribute them among a cluster of worker nodes, and ensure that all tasks are completed successfully, even in the face of worker node failures.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Task Submission:** The scheduler must provide an API (e.g., gRPC or HTTP) to accept tasks.  Each task is a self-contained unit of work represented as a string (e.g., a command to execute, a URL to fetch, etc.).

2.  **Worker Registration:** Worker nodes must be able to register themselves with the scheduler, indicating their availability to accept tasks.

3.  **Task Distribution:** The scheduler must distribute tasks to available workers, aiming for even load distribution.  A simple round-robin or random assignment is acceptable initially, but the design should allow for more sophisticated scheduling algorithms in the future.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must handle worker node failures gracefully. If a worker node fails while processing a task, the scheduler must detect the failure and re-assign the task to another available worker.

5.  **Task Completion Tracking:** The scheduler must track the status of each task (e.g., pending, assigned, completed, failed).

6.  **Result Retrieval:** The scheduler must provide an API to retrieve the results of completed tasks. Task results are also strings.

7.  **Scalability**: The design should be scalable for a large number of workers (hundreds or even thousands), and a large number of tasks.

8. **Concurrency**: The scheduler must be able to concurrently process and distribute tasks.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Communication:**  You can use any suitable communication mechanism between the scheduler and worker nodes (e.g., gRPC, HTTP, message queues).
*   **Data Storage:**  You'll need to store task information, worker availability, and task results.  Consider using an in-memory data structure for simplicity initially, but the design should be easily adaptable to use a persistent storage solution (e.g., Redis, etcd) for robustness.
*   **Failure Detection:** Implement a simple heartbeat mechanism for worker nodes to signal their availability to the scheduler.  If a heartbeat is not received within a reasonable timeout, the scheduler should consider the worker node failed.
*   **Task Idempotency**: Each task should be designed to be idempotent where possible, to avoid unexpected behavior if retried due to worker failure.
*   **Resource Limits:** The tasks are resource intensive. The scheduler should limit the number of concurrently running tasks per worker.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a more sophisticated scheduling algorithm (e.g., based on worker node capabilities or task priorities).
*   Implement task dependencies (e.g., task B cannot start until task A is completed).
*   Integrate with a persistent storage solution for increased reliability.
*   Implement a distributed lock mechanism to prevent race conditions in the scheduler.
*   Provide metrics and monitoring capabilities (e.g., using Prometheus and Grafana).
*   Implement a rate limiter to prevent abuse of the task submission API.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the scheduler correctly distribute tasks, handle failures, and track task completion?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the scheduler efficient in terms of resource utilization and task completion time?
*   **Scalability:** Is the design scalable to a large number of workers and tasks?
*   **Fault Tolerance:** How well does the system handle worker node failures?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Design:** Is the overall system design well-thought-out and extensible?

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, distributed systems, and fault tolerance principles. It's designed to be challenging and open-ended, allowing participants to explore different design choices and optimization techniques. Good luck!

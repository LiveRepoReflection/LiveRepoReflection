Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills.

### Question Description

Imagine you're simulating the evolution of a social network. You're given an initial social network represented as a directed graph where nodes are users and edges represent follows.  The network evolves over discrete time steps according to a set of probabilistic rules. Your task is to predict the network's structure at a given future time step.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of users in the social network (nodes in the graph). Users are numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `initialGraph`: A 2D slice (adjacency matrix) representing the initial directed graph. `initialGraph[i][j] = true` if user `i` follows user `j`, and `false` otherwise.
*   `evolutionRules`: A slice of `EvolutionRule` structs, where each rule defines a probabilistic change to the graph.
*   `timeSteps`: The number of time steps to simulate.

```go
type EvolutionRule struct {
    SourceUser  int     // The user initiating the action
    TargetUser  int     // The user being followed/unfollowed
    ActionType  string  // "follow" or "unfollow"
    Probability float64 // The probability of this rule being applied at each timestep
}
```

**Output:**

*   A 2D slice (adjacency matrix) representing the predicted directed graph after `timeSteps`. `resultGraph[i][j] = true` if user `i` follows user `j` at the end of the simulation, and `false` otherwise.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100` (Number of Users)
*   `0 <= timeSteps <= 1000` (Number of time steps)
*   `0.0 <= rule.Probability <= 1.0` for all rules.
*   `0 <= rule.SourceUser < n` for all rules.
*   `0 <= rule.TargetUser < n` for all rules.
*   The `initialGraph` will always be a valid `n x n` adjacency matrix.
*   Multiple rules might target the same `SourceUser` and `TargetUser`, but with different `ActionTypes`.
*   The rules are applied sequentially in each time step.
*   The simulation should be stochastic (probabilistic), reflecting the `Probability` in each `EvolutionRule`.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The simulation should be as efficient as possible, especially for large values of `timeSteps`.  Naive approaches might lead to Time Limit Exceeded errors.

**Real-World Scenario:**

This problem models a simplified version of how social networks evolve. Understanding the dynamics of network evolution is crucial for tasks like recommendation systems, influence maximization, and detecting misinformation campaigns.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Consider how to handle a large number of users and rules efficiently. The choice of data structures and algorithms can significantly impact performance.

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   Aim for a solution with a time complexity better than O(timeSteps \* n^2 \* numRules), where numRules is the number of evolution rules.
*   Consider using appropriate random number generation techniques.

**Multiple Valid Approaches with Different Trade-Offs:**

*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Simulate the evolution multiple times and average the results.
*   **Probabilistic Matrix Calculation:** Calculate the probabilities of each edge existing after each time step, potentially using matrix operations.  This approach may require more complex mathematical reasoning.

**Specific Challenges:**

*   **Handling Probabilities:** Implementing the probabilistic rules accurately is crucial.
*   **Optimization:** Finding an efficient way to simulate a large number of time steps without exceeding time limits.
*   **Edge Cases:** Correctly handling cases where a user might try to follow/unfollow themselves, or when a follow/unfollow action has no effect (e.g., unfollowing someone they don't follow).

This problem combines graph manipulation, probability, and optimization, requiring a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures to achieve an efficient and correct solution. Good luck!

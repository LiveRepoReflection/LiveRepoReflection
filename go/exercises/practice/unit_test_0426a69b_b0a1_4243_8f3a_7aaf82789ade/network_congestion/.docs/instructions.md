Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level, focusing on a real-world scenario, efficiency, and handling numerous edge cases.

**Problem Title:** Network Congestion Control

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a simplified network congestion control algorithm.  Imagine a network where packets are sent from source nodes to destination nodes via a series of routers. Each router has a limited buffer capacity.  If the rate of incoming packets exceeds the router's processing capacity and buffer, packets are dropped.  Your goal is to simulate this network and determine the number of packets successfully delivered to their destinations, given a specific network topology, router capacities, and packet sending rates.

**Input:**

The network is represented as follows:

1.  **Routers:** A slice of `Router` structs. Each `Router` has the following fields:
    *   `ID`: An integer representing the unique ID of the router.
    *   `Capacity`: An integer representing the number of packets the router can process and store in its buffer *per second*.
    *   `NextHop`: A slice of integers representing the IDs of the routers to which this router forwards packets.  An empty `NextHop` slice indicates that this router is a destination node.

    ```go
    type Router struct {
    	ID       int
    	Capacity int
    	NextHop  []int
    }
    ```

2.  **Packets:** A slice of `Packet` structs. Each `Packet` has the following fields:
    *   `Source`: An integer representing the ID of the source router where the packet originates.
    *   `Destination`: An integer representing the ID of the destination router where the packet should be delivered.
    *   `CreationTime`: An integer representing the second at which the packet is created (starts its journey).

    ```go
    type Packet struct {
    	Source      int
    	Destination int
    	CreationTime int
    }
    ```

3.  **Routing Table:** A `map[int][]int` representing the routing table. The key is the source Router ID, and the value is a slice of Router IDs representing the optimal path to the destination. The routing table is pre-computed using a valid routing algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra).

4.  **Simulation Duration:** An integer representing the number of seconds to simulate the network.

**Output:**

An integer representing the total number of packets that successfully reach their destination routers within the simulation duration.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Packet Processing:**  Each router processes packets in a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) manner.
*   **Packet Dropping:** If a router's buffer is full (i.e., the number of packets at a router exceeds its `Capacity`), incoming packets are dropped.  Dropped packets are lost and do not continue in the simulation.
*   **Time-Based Simulation:**  The simulation progresses in discrete time steps of one second.
*   **Multiple Packets per Second:** A router can receive and forward multiple packets in a single second, up to its `Capacity`.
*   **Optimal Path:**  Packets must follow the optimal path specified in the routing table. If, at any point in time, the packet is at the "wrong" router (not on optimal path), then the packet is dropped.
*   **Asynchronous Behavior:** Routers operate asynchronously.  A router processes packets based on its own capacity, independent of other routers.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle cases where a packet's source or destination does not exist in the network topology.  These packets should be considered dropped.
*   **Routing Table Consistency**: Ensure that the routing table is consistent with the network topology. If a router has no path to its destination, then packets for the destination are dropped.
*   **Scalability:** The solution should be reasonably efficient for networks with a large number of routers and packets.
*   **No External Libraries:** You may not use external libraries for core network simulation logic (e.g., no external graph libraries, no external queuing libraries). Standard Go libraries are permitted.

**Example:**

```go
//Simplified example
routers := []Router{
    {ID: 1, Capacity: 2, NextHop: []int{2}},
    {ID: 2, Capacity: 1, NextHop: []int{3}},
    {ID: 3, Capacity: 1, NextHop: []int{}}, // Destination
}

packets := []Packet{
    {Source: 1, Destination: 3, CreationTime: 0},
    {Source: 1, Destination: 3, CreationTime: 0},
    {Source: 1, Destination: 3, CreationTime: 1},
}

routingTable := map[int][]int{
	1: {1, 2, 3},
	2: {2, 3},
	3: {3},
}

simulationDuration := 5

successfulPackets := SimulateNetwork(routers, packets, routingTable, simulationDuration)
// Expected Output: 2 (Due to capacity constraints)
```

**Challenge:**

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithms to efficiently simulate the network behavior.  You'll need to manage packet queues at each router, simulate packet processing, handle dropped packets, and ensure that packets follow the correct routes.  The scalability requirement necessitates efficient data structures and algorithms. The multiple constraints and asynchronous nature of the simulation make this a challenging and realistic problem. Good luck!

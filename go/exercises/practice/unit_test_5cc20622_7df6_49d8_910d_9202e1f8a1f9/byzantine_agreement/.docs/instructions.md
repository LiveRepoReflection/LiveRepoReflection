## The Byzantine Agreement Problem with Faulty Nodes

**Question Description:**

You are designing a distributed consensus system for a critical application. The system consists of `n` nodes, where `n` is a positive integer. Each node needs to agree on a single binary value (0 or 1). However, some nodes in the system might be faulty and can exhibit Byzantine behavior, meaning they can send conflicting or incorrect information to different nodes.

Specifically, up to `f` nodes can be faulty, where `f < n/3`. This constraint is crucial for ensuring that a consensus can be achieved despite the presence of faulty nodes.

Your task is to implement a function `ByzantineAgreement(n int, f int, initialValues []int) int` in Go that simulates the Byzantine Agreement protocol and returns the agreed-upon binary value. The function receives the total number of nodes `n`, the maximum number of faulty nodes `f`, and an array `initialValues` of length `n`, where `initialValues[i]` represents the initial binary value of node `i`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Agreement:** All non-faulty nodes must eventually agree on the same binary value.

2.  **Validity:** If all non-faulty nodes initially propose the same value `v`, then the agreed-upon value must be `v`.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must reach a consensus even if up to `f` nodes are faulty and exhibit arbitrary behavior.

4.  **Simulation:** Your function should simulate the message exchanges and decision-making process of the Byzantine Agreement protocol. You **do not** need to implement a real network communication layer. Instead, use data structures to represent messages and node states.

5.  **Efficiency:** While achieving consensus is the primary goal, strive for efficiency in terms of message complexity and computational complexity. Consider the trade-offs between different approaches.  Excessive and unnecessary allocations will result in penalties.

6.  **Deterministic Output:** Given the same `n`, `f`, and `initialValues`, the function should always return the same result. This requires careful handling of any randomness used to simulate faulty node behavior.

7.  **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases such as:

    *   All nodes start with the same value.
    *   The number of faulty nodes is 0.
    *   The initial values are evenly split between 0 and 1.
    *   `n` is close to the minimum required value (i.e., `n = 3f + 1`).

8. **Faulty Node Behavior:** To simulate faulty nodes, you can implement the following behavior:

    * Randomly send different values (0 or 1) to different nodes.
    * Send no value to some nodes.
    * Send the opposite of the value the node initially had.
    * Collude with other faulty nodes to confuse non-faulty nodes.

9. **Implementation Details:** You are free to choose any Byzantine Agreement algorithm that satisfies the constraints. However, consider the practicality and complexity of the algorithm for the given problem size. Simplifications or optimizations might be necessary.

10. **Memory Constraints:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of nodes. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

**Example:**

```go
// Example usage (not part of the solution, just for illustration)
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	n := 4 // Total number of nodes
	f := 1 // Maximum number of faulty nodes
	initialValues := []int{1, 1, 0, 1} // Initial values of each node

	agreedValue := ByzantineAgreement(n, f, initialValues)
	fmt.Println("Agreed Value:", agreedValue)
}
```

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed consensus algorithms, fault tolerance, and careful implementation to handle the complexities introduced by Byzantine failures. Good luck!

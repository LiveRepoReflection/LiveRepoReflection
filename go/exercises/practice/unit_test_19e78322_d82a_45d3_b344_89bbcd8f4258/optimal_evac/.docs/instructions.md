## Question: Optimal Evacuation Planning

**Description:**

A city is represented as a weighted, undirected graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent roads connecting them. Each location has a population density value associated with it. In case of a catastrophic event, the city needs to be evacuated efficiently.

There are `K` designated evacuation centers in the city. Your task is to devise an evacuation plan that minimizes the *maximum evacuation time* for any individual in the city. The evacuation time for an individual at a particular location is defined as the shortest path distance (sum of edge weights) from that location to its nearest evacuation center.

**Input:**

*   `N`: Number of locations in the city (numbered from 0 to N-1).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents an undirected road between location `u` and location `v` with a weight (time) `w`.
*   `population`: A list of integers, where `population[i]` represents the population density at location `i`.
*   `evacuation_centers`: A list of integers, representing the indices of the locations designated as evacuation centers.
*   `max_road_capacity`: Each road (edge) has limited capacity. If the population evacuating through any road exceeds its `max_road_capacity` at any time, the evacuation will fail.

**Output:**

A single floating-point number representing the minimum possible maximum evacuation time for any individual in the city. Return -1 if the city cannot be fully evacuated due to road capacity constraints or if any location is unreachable from any evacuation center.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= N * (N - 1) / 2`
*   `0 <= population[i] <= 10000`
*   `1 <= K <= N` (Number of evacuation centers)
*   `0 <= evacuation_centers[i] < N`
*   `1 <= max_road_capacity <= 10000`
*   Edge weights (`w`) are positive integers.
*   All evacuation center locations are unique.
*   Assume that people evacuate proportionally to the number of shortest paths.

**Optimization Requirement:**

The solution must be computationally efficient. A naive approach will likely result in exceeding the time limit. Consider the trade-offs between different algorithmic choices.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   A location might have a population of 0.
*   `K` might be equal to `N` (every location is an evacuation center).
*   The same location could be connected multiple times by different roads.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

1.  **Correctness:** The output must be the correct minimum possible maximum evacuation time.
2.  **Efficiency:** The solution must execute within the given time limit.
3.  **Handling of Edge Cases:** The solution must correctly handle all specified edge cases, including returning -1 when evacuation is impossible.
4. **Capacity Constraint:** The solution should calculate the population flow through each edge and make sure it's within the maximum capacity.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest paths), potentially binary search or other optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases and efficiency.

```
Distributed Key-Value Store with Range Queries
```

## Question Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed key-value store that supports efficient range queries. The system consists of multiple nodes, each responsible for storing a subset of the key space.

**Key Space:** Keys are 64-bit unsigned integers.

**Nodes:** The system contains `N` nodes (where `1 <= N <= 1000`). Each node is responsible for a contiguous range of the key space. The ranges are non-overlapping and together cover the entire key space (0 to 2^64 - 1).  The nodes are already configured, you are given the range of keys that each node manages.

**Data Replication:** For fault tolerance, each key-value pair is replicated across `R` nodes (where `1 <= R <= N`). When a key-value pair is inserted, it should be stored on the `R` nodes responsible for that key, starting with the "primary" node in the range. Replication is done based on node ID order.

**Operations:**

1.  **`Put(key, value)`:** Stores the given key-value pair in the system.
2.  **`Get(key)`:** Retrieves the value associated with the given key. If the key doesn't exist, return an appropriate error. The value should be retrieved from a node that contains the key.
3.  **`RangeQuery(startKey, endKey)`:** Retrieves all key-value pairs where `startKey <= key <= endKey`. The results should be returned in ascending order of keys. This operation is critical and should be optimized for performance.
4.  **`NodeStatus()`:** Returns the key range that each node manages. This information can be used to help other requests.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of keys and requests.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to tolerate the failure of up to `R-1` nodes without losing data.
*   **Efficiency:** The `RangeQuery` operation should be optimized for minimal latency.  Consider strategies for parallelizing the query and minimizing data transfer.
*   **Data Consistency:** Strong consistency is NOT required. Eventual consistency is sufficient. It is acceptable to have stale reads.
*   **Concurrency:**  The system should handle concurrent `Put`, `Get`, and `RangeQuery` requests correctly.
*   **Memory Limit:** Each node has a limited amount of memory. Your solution must be mindful of memory usage, especially when handling large range queries. Avoid loading the entire key space into memory at once.

**Assumptions:**

*   The key-value store is initially empty.
*   The node ranges are pre-configured and do not change during the execution of the program.
*   The number of nodes `N` and replication factor `R` are known in advance.
*   Values are strings.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty key range for `RangeQuery`.
*   `startKey` > `endKey` for `RangeQuery`.
*   Key falling outside of the defined key space.
*   Node failures during `Put`, `Get`, or `RangeQuery`. (Handle gracefully â€“ eventual consistency is acceptable).
*   Large key ranges for `RangeQuery` that could potentially exhaust memory.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the latency of the `RangeQuery` operation.
*   Minimize the amount of data transferred between nodes during `RangeQuery`.
*   Optimize for high throughput under concurrent requests.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Consider the distribution of data across nodes.
*   Consider the communication protocol between nodes.
*   Consider the use of caching to improve performance.
*   Consider the impact of node failures on performance and data availability.

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The `RangeQuery` operation should have a time complexity that is proportional to the number of key-value pairs within the range, not the total key space.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., sorted maps, B-trees) to efficiently store and retrieve data on each node.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, distributed systems concepts, and optimization techniques. A well-designed solution will be able to handle large datasets, concurrent requests, and node failures efficiently.

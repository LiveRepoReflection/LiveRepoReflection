Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, incorporating various complex elements.

**Project Name:** `ScalableSocialGraph`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable social graph service. This service needs to handle a massive number of users and their connections (following/followers). The core functionalities are:

1.  **Add/Remove User:** Allows adding and removing users from the social graph. Each user is identified by a unique string ID.

2.  **Follow/Unfollow:** Allows a user to follow/unfollow another user.

3.  **Get Followers:** Given a user ID, return a list of all user IDs who are following that user. The list should be sorted lexicographically.

4.  **Get Following:** Given a user ID, return a list of all user IDs that the user is following. The list should be sorted lexicographically.

5.  **Mutual Followers:** Given two user IDs, return a list of their mutual followers (users who follow both). The list should be sorted lexicographically.

6.  **Suggest Friends:** Given a user ID, suggest a list of potential friends (users they might want to follow). The suggestion algorithm should prioritize users who:
    *   Are followed by at least `K` of the user's existing following.
    *   Are not already followed by the user.
    *   Are not the user themselves.
    The returned list should be the top `N` users according to the number of mutual followers, breaking ties lexicographically by user ID.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The service must be able to handle millions of users and billions of connections.  Consider the memory footprint and algorithmic complexity of your data structures and algorithms.
*   **Concurrency:** The service must be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent requests.
*   **Performance:**  All operations should be reasonably fast.  Optimize for read operations (getting followers/following, mutual followers, and especially friend suggestions) as these will be the most frequent.
*   **Memory Usage:** Keep the memory footprint as low as possible.
*   **Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures to efficiently store and retrieve user connections.  Consider trade-offs between memory usage and performance.  You may use standard Go data structures or explore external libraries for specialized graph databases.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases gracefully.  For example, what happens if a user tries to follow themselves?  What happens if a user tries to follow a user that doesn't exist? What happens if user is deleted?
*   **K and N Parameters:** The `K` and `N` parameters for the `SuggestFriends` function should be configurable.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling.  Return appropriate error values when operations fail (e.g., user not found).

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Distribution:** While you don't need to implement actual distributed storage in this single-machine coding problem, *consider* how your design could be extended to handle data distribution across multiple machines for true horizontal scalability.
*   **Real-World Scenarios:** Think about real-world social graph scenarios.  For example, some users might have significantly more followers than others (the "celebrity" problem). Your design should handle this skew gracefully.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** The `SuggestFriends` function is the most challenging.  A naive implementation could be very slow.  Think about how to optimize this algorithm.
*   **Trade-offs:** There are multiple valid approaches to this problem, each with different trade-offs between memory usage, performance, and complexity. Document your design choices and the rationale behind them.

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles. The difficulty comes from balancing the various constraints and requirements to create a scalable and efficient social graph service.  Good luck!

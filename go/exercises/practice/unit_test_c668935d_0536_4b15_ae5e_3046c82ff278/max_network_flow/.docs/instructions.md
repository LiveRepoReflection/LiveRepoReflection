Okay, here's a problem description designed to be challenging, sophisticated, and LeetCode Hard level, incorporating the elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkFlow`

**Question Description:**

You are given a representation of a directed graph representing a communication network. The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and `m` directed edges. Each edge has a capacity representing the maximum amount of data that can flow through it.

The graph is provided as follows:

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.
*   `edges`: A slice of slices, where each inner slice `[u, v, capacity]` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with the specified `capacity`.

Your task is to implement a function that finds the maximum possible flow from a source node `source` to a sink node `sink` in this network, with the following constraints and considerations:

1.  **Optimality:** Find the *absolute* maximum flow.  Solutions that are close but not optimal will not be accepted.

2.  **Efficiency:** The graph can be large (up to `n = 1000` nodes and `m = 10000` edges). Your solution must be efficient enough to handle these sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider the algorithmic complexity of your chosen approach.  Naive algorithms will time out.

3.  **Integer Capacities:**  All edge capacities are non-negative integers.

4.  **Residual Graph:**  Your implementation *must* correctly maintain and use a residual graph to account for flow in both directions along edges.

5.  **Multiple Paths:** The maximum flow may require utilizing multiple paths from the source to the sink.

6.  **Zero Capacity Edges:** The input may contain edges with zero capacity.  Handle these correctly.

7.  **Disconnected Graph:** The graph may be disconnected (i.e., there might not be any path from source to sink). In that case, the maximum flow is 0.

8.  **Large Capacities:** Edge capacities can be large (up to 10<sup>9</sup>).

9.  **No Self-Loops or Parallel Edges:** The input graph will *not* contain self-loops (edges from a node to itself) or parallel edges (multiple edges between the same pair of nodes in the same direction).

10. **Error Handling:** If the `source` or `sink` node is out of the range [0, n-1], return -1. If `source == sink`, return 0.

**Function Signature:**

```go
func MaxFlow(n int, edges [][]int, source int, sink int) int {
    // Your code here
}
```

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the graph.
*   `edges`: A slice of slices representing the directed edges and their capacities.
*   `source`: The source node.
*   `sink`: The sink node.

**Output:**

*   The maximum possible flow from the source to the sink. Return -1 if `source` or `sink` is out of bounds, or 0 if source == sink.

**Example:**

```go
n := 6
edges := [][]int{
    {0, 1, 16},
    {0, 2, 13},
    {1, 2, 10},
    {1, 3, 12},
    {2, 1, 4},
    {2, 4, 14},
    {3, 2, 9},
    {3, 5, 20},
    {4, 3, 7},
    {4, 5, 4},
}
source := 0
sink := 5

maxFlow := MaxFlow(n, edges, source, sink) // Expected: 23
```

**Hints and Considerations (but still challenging!):**

*   Consider algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson with Edmonds-Karp (BFS for finding augmenting paths) or Dinic's algorithm.  Dinic's algorithm is generally faster.
*   Think carefully about how to represent the residual graph.  A matrix representation is often used.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   Optimize your code for speed and memory usage.

This problem requires a good understanding of network flow algorithms, careful implementation, and attention to detail. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description.

## Problem: Multi-Tenant Rate Limiter with Token Bucket

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a multi-tenant rate limiter using the token bucket algorithm.  This rate limiter will be used to protect a shared API from abuse and ensure fair usage across multiple tenants (customers).

**Functionality:**

*   **Tenants:** The rate limiter must support an arbitrary number of tenants, each identified by a unique string key (e.g., a customer ID).
*   **Rate Limits:** Each tenant has a configurable rate limit defined by two parameters:
    *   `capacity`: The maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold.
    *   `refillRate`: The number of tokens added to the bucket per second. This value can be a float.
*   **Request Handling:**  The rate limiter must provide a function `Allow(tenantID string, tokens int) bool` that checks if a tenant is allowed to consume a specified number of `tokens`.
    *   If the tenant has enough tokens in their bucket, the function should deduct the tokens and return `true`.
    *   If the tenant does not have enough tokens, the function should return `false` without deducting any tokens.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** The rate limit for a tenant can be updated dynamically at any time.
*   **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple tenants.
*   **Persistence (Optional):** For a more advanced challenge, explore persistence, which ensures rate limits are preserved across application restarts. This can be achieved through file storage or a database.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Efficiency:**  The `Allow` function must be highly efficient, as it will be called frequently for every API request. Aim for O(1) time complexity, or as close as possible. Consider the performance implications of locking.
2.  **Accuracy:**  Token refills must be accurate, even with fractional `refillRate` values.  Avoid accumulating errors over time.
3.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be able to handle a large number of tenants without significant performance degradation.  Consider using appropriate data structures for efficient tenant lookup.
4.  **Memory Management:**  Avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of tenants. Think about garbage collection implications.
5.  **Race Conditions:** Ensure that there are no race conditions when updating the token bucket state for each tenant.
6.  **No External Libraries (Initially):**  For the core implementation, avoid using external rate-limiting libraries.  Focus on implementing the token bucket algorithm from scratch.  (Later, you might compare your implementation's performance to existing libraries.)
7.  **Graceful Degradation:** Consider what happens if the rate limiter fails (e.g., due to a database connection error if you implement persistence).  Design the system to degrade gracefully, perhaps by temporarily disabling rate limiting or using a default rate limit.
8.  **Zero Values:** Handle the case where `capacity` or `refillRate` are zero. What should happen in this case?
9.  **Negative Token Consumption:** Handle the edge case where `tokens` parameter is negative.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   **Burst Handling:**  Allow tenants to exceed their rate limit temporarily, up to a maximum burst size.
*   **Hierarchical Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limits at multiple levels (e.g., per user, per organization, globally).
*   **Integration with a Real API:**  Integrate the rate limiter into a simple HTTP API to demonstrate its functionality.
*   **Metrics and Monitoring:**  Expose metrics (e.g., requests allowed, requests denied, token bucket levels) for monitoring and analysis.
*   **Distributed Rate Limiting:**  Extend the rate limiter to work across multiple servers in a distributed environment.

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, data structures, and algorithm optimization. Good luck!

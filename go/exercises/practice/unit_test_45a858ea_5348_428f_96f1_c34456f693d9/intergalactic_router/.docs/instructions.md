Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, incorporating elements you suggested.

**Project Name:** `IntergalacticRouter`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly efficient intergalactic communication router. The intergalactic network consists of planets connected by wormholes.  Each wormhole has a certain *instability factor* associated with it.  Traveling through a wormhole with a high instability factor risks data corruption.

The network is represented as a graph where:

*   **Planets** are nodes, identified by unique string names (e.g., "Earth", "Alpha Centauri").
*   **Wormholes** are bidirectional edges connecting planets. Each wormhole has a positive integer *instability factor*.  Multiple wormholes can exist between the same two planets, each with a potentially different instability factor.

Your task is to implement a function `FindSafestRoute(graph map[string]map[string][]int, startPlanet string, endPlanet string, maxHops int) ([]string, int)`.

**Function Signature:**

```go
func FindSafestRoute(graph map[string]map[string][]int, startPlanet string, endPlanet string, maxHops int) ([]string, int) {
  // Your code here
}
```

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A map representing the intergalactic network. The outer map's keys are planet names (strings).  The inner map's keys are adjacent planet names (strings). The inner map's values are a *slice* of integers representing the instability factors of the wormholes directly connecting the two planets. For example:

    ```go
    graph := map[string]map[string][]int{
        "Earth": {
            "Alpha Centauri": {5, 10},
            "Mars": {2},
        },
        "Alpha Centauri": {
            "Earth": {5, 10},
            "Beta Cygni": {7},
        },
        "Mars": {
            "Earth": {2},
            "Beta Cygni": {1},
        },
        "Beta Cygni": {
            "Alpha Centauri": {7},
            "Mars": {1},
            "Epsilon Eridani": {3},
        },
        "Epsilon Eridani": {
            "Beta Cygni": {3},
        },
    }
    ```

*   `startPlanet`: The name of the planet to start the journey from (string).
*   `endPlanet`: The name of the destination planet (string).
*   `maxHops`: The maximum number of wormholes that can be traversed during the journey (integer). This is a hard constraint.

**Output:**

*   A slice of strings representing the *safest* route from `startPlanet` to `endPlanet`, including the `startPlanet` and `endPlanet` in the correct order.  If no route is possible within the `maxHops` limit, return an empty slice (`[]string{}`).
*   An integer representing the *maximum instability factor* encountered along the *safest* route. If no route is possible, return -1.

**Safety Metric:**

The *safest* route is defined as the route with the *lowest maximum instability factor* among all wormholes used in the route.  The goal is to minimize the *worst* instability factor encountered on the trip, not the sum of all instability factors.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Invalid Planet Names:** The input `startPlanet` or `endPlanet` might not exist in the `graph`.  Return an empty slice and -1 in this case.
*   **Self-Loops:** The graph may contain wormholes connecting a planet to itself.  These wormholes should be ignored.
*   **Disconnected Graph:** There might not be any route between `startPlanet` and `endPlanet`. Return an empty slice and -1 in this case.
*   **Multiple Routes:** There can be multiple routes between `startPlanet` and `endPlanet`.  You must find the *safest* one.
*   **Equal Safety:** If multiple routes have the same maximum instability factor, return the shortest one (fewest hops). If multiple shortest paths have the same maximum instability factor, return any of them.
*   **Large Graph:** The graph can be very large (hundreds or thousands of planets and wormholes). Efficiency is crucial.
*   **maxHops = 0:** If `maxHops` is 0, only return a valid route if the start and end planets are the same.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be reasonably efficient.  A brute-force approach that explores all possible paths will likely time out for larger graphs. Consider using appropriate graph algorithms and data structures for optimal performance.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, optimization, and careful handling of edge cases. Good luck!

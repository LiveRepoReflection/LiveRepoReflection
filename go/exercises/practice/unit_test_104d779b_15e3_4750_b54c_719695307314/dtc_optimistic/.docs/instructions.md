Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Go programming competition problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator with Optimistic Concurrency Control

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture.  Imagine several independent services (represented as integer IDs) need to participate in atomic transactions.  Each service manages its own data.  The DTC is responsible for ensuring that transactions involving multiple services either commit across all services or rollback across all services.

The DTC will use an optimistic concurrency control (OCC) mechanism based on version numbers to manage concurrent transactions. Each service's data has a version number that increments whenever it's modified.

**Specifically, you need to implement the following:**

1.  **`Transaction` struct:** Represents a transaction.  It should contain:
    *   A unique transaction ID (integer).
    *   A map of service ID (integer) to data version number (integer) that the transaction *expects* to be valid when it attempts to commit (optimistic lock).
    *   A state (e.g., `Pending`, `Committed`, `Aborted`).

2.  **`DTC` struct:** Represents the distributed transaction coordinator.  It should contain:
    *   A map of service ID (integer) to current data version number (integer). This represents the *actual* state of each service.
    *   A map of transaction ID (integer) to `Transaction` struct.

3.  **`BeginTransaction()` method:** Starts a new transaction.  It should:
    *   Generate a unique transaction ID.
    *   Create a new `Transaction` in the `Pending` state.
    *   Return the new transaction ID.

4.  **`PrepareTransaction(transactionID int, serviceID int, expectedVersion int)` method:** Records a service's intention to participate in the transaction. It should:
    *   Find the transaction by `transactionID`.
    *   Record the `serviceID` and the `expectedVersion` in the transaction's version map.
    *   Return an error if the transaction does not exist.

5.  **`CommitTransaction(transactionID int)` method:** Attempts to commit the transaction. It should:
    *   Find the transaction by `transactionID`.
    *   **OCC Validation:** For each service participating in the transaction, verify that the service's current data version number matches the `expectedVersion` recorded in the transaction.
        *   If *any* version check fails, the transaction must be aborted.
        *   If *all* version checks pass, the transaction can be committed.
    *   **Commit Logic:** If all version checks pass:
        *   Increment the data version number for each participating service in the `DTC`'s service version map.
        *   Set the transaction's state to `Committed`.
        *   Return `true` (indicating successful commit).
    *   **Rollback Logic:** If any version check fails:
        *   Set the transaction's state to `Aborted`.
        *   Return `false` (indicating failed commit).

6.  **`GetTransactionState(transactionID int)` method:** Returns the current state of the transaction (e.g., `Pending`, `Committed`, `Aborted`).  Return an error if the transaction doesn't exist.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The `DTC` must be thread-safe. Multiple goroutines might attempt to `PrepareTransaction` and `CommitTransaction` concurrently. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels) to ensure data consistency.
*   **Atomicity:** The commit process must be atomic. Either all participating services' versions are updated, or none are.
*   **Optimistic Concurrency:**  You MUST implement optimistic concurrency control using version numbers.  No other locking mechanisms are allowed *except* for internal synchronization to ensure thread safety.
*   **Error Handling:**  Provide meaningful error messages for invalid transaction IDs, version conflicts, and other potential issues.
*   **Efficiency:**  The commit operation should be as efficient as possible.  Avoid unnecessary locking or looping.
*   **Scalability:**  While this is an in-memory implementation, consider how the design could be extended to handle a large number of services and concurrent transactions.  (This aspect will be implicitly judged based on the design choices you make).
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as:
    *   Attempting to commit a transaction that doesn't exist.
    *   Attempting to prepare a transaction with a service that is already part of another pending transaction.
    *   Concurrent modification of the same service's data by multiple transactions.
    *   Attempting to prepare a transaction with duplicate service IDs.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the code correctly implement the DTC logic and handle all the specified constraints and edge cases?
*   **Concurrency Safety:** Is the code thread-safe and free from race conditions?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the code efficient in terms of resource usage and execution time?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Does it follow Go best practices?
*   **Error Handling:** Are errors handled gracefully and informatively?

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, data structures, and distributed systems concepts.  Good luck!

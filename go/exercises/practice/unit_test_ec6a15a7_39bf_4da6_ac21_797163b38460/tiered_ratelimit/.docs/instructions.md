Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills, including data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and error handling.

### Problem Title: Distributed Rate Limiter with Tiered Access

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service in Go. This service needs to handle a high volume of requests from various clients, enforcing different rate limits based on tiered access levels.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're building an API service that offers different tiers of access:

*   **Free Tier:** Limited to 10 requests per minute per IP address.
*   **Basic Tier:** Limited to 100 requests per minute per API key.
*   **Premium Tier:** Limited to 1000 requests per minute per API key.
*   **Admin Tier:** No rate limit.

The service must be distributed, meaning multiple instances of the rate limiter can run concurrently on different machines. This requires careful consideration of data consistency and synchronization.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Functionality:**
    *   Implement a `RateLimiter` struct with methods to:
        *   `Allow(key string, tier string) bool`:  This is the core function. It should return `true` if the request identified by `key` and `tier` is allowed within the current rate limit, and `false` otherwise.
        *   The `key` could be either an IP Address or an API Key. The `tier` would indicate which tier the key belongs to.
    *   Implement a mechanism to dynamically update rate limits for each tier without restarting the service.
    *   Handle concurrent requests efficiently and accurately.
    *   Implement a graceful shutdown mechanism that allows the service to complete in-flight requests before exiting.

2.  **Data Structures:**
    *   Choose appropriate data structures to store and manage rate limit information (e.g., counters, timestamps).  Consider memory usage and access time.
    *   Design a data structure suitable for distributed operation and concurrent access.

3.  **Distribution and Concurrency:**
    *   Implement a distributed solution, possibly using a shared cache like Redis or Memcached to store rate limit counters across multiple instances.
    *   Use Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, mutexes, atomic operations) to handle concurrent requests efficiently.  Minimize lock contention.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Handle potential errors gracefully, such as network errors when communicating with the shared cache.
    *   Implement appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring.

5.  **Optimization:**
    *   Optimize the `Allow` method for speed, as it will be called frequently.
    *   Minimize memory usage.
    *   Consider strategies for handling bursts of traffic.

6.  **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
    *   Handle invalid API keys or IP addresses.
    *   Ensure that the rate limiter works correctly across minute boundaries (e.g., requests at the end of one minute should not affect the limit for the next minute).
    *   The service needs to be resilient to individual instance failures.
    *   Assume a large number of unique keys (IP addresses and API keys).

7. **Tier Configuration:**

* You should define a configuration mechanism that allows the administrator to modify the rate limits of each tier without redeploying the application. This could involve reading from a configuration file or a dedicated configuration service.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the rate limiter accurately enforce the specified limits for each tier?
*   **Performance:** How efficiently does the `Allow` method handle a high volume of requests?
*   **Scalability:** How well does the service scale horizontally across multiple instances?
*   **Concurrency:** How effectively does the service handle concurrent requests without race conditions or deadlocks?
*   **Robustness:** How resilient is the service to errors and failures?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Design:** Is the overall design of the rate limiter service well-thought-out and appropriate for the problem?

**Bonus Points:**

*   Implement a "leaky bucket" algorithm for smoother rate limiting and burst handling.
*   Provide a mechanism for monitoring and visualizing rate limit usage.
*   Write comprehensive unit tests.
*   Implement a mechanism for invalidating cached rate limit counters when API keys are revoked or tiers are changed.

This problem requires a solid understanding of Go's concurrency model, data structures, and distributed systems concepts. It encourages the use of best practices for error handling, optimization, and code quality. Good luck!

## The Quantum Entanglement Network

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly secure, low-latency communication network based on the principles of quantum entanglement. This network will connect a set of `n` quantum computers (nodes). Due to the nature of quantum entanglement, certain pairs of nodes can establish a direct, instantaneous connection (an "entangled link"). However, creating and maintaining these entangled links is extremely expensive and resource-intensive.

The network's security relies on the fundamental principle that any attempt to eavesdrop on an entangled link will collapse the entanglement, thereby alerting the communicating parties. Your goal is to design a routing algorithm that minimizes the number of entangled links used in any communication path while ensuring that all nodes can communicate with each other, directly or indirectly.

Furthermore, the quantum computers have varying degrees of "quantum coherence." This means some computers are more reliable than others in the entangled state. You must also ensure that communication paths avoid nodes with low coherence, if possible, as these nodes are more prone to errors and disruptions.

**Input:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of quantum computers (nodes) in the network (1 <= `n` <= 500). Nodes are numbered from 0 to `n-1`.
*   `entanglement_matrix`: An `n x n` boolean matrix where `entanglement_matrix[i][j] == true` if a direct entangled link can be established between nodes `i` and `j`, and `false` otherwise. The matrix is symmetric (i.e., `entanglement_matrix[i][j] == entanglement_matrix[j][i]`) and `entanglement_matrix[i][i] == false` for all `i`.
*   `coherence_levels`: An array of `n` integers representing the quantum coherence levels of each node. The coherence level of node `i` is `coherence_levels[i]` (0 <= `coherence_levels[i]` <= 100). Higher values indicate better coherence.
*   `source`: The starting node for communication.
*   `destination`: The target node for communication.

**Output:**

The minimal number of entangled links required to establish a secure communication path from the source node to the destination node, prioritizing paths that avoid nodes with low coherence (lower coherence values should be avoided if possible, but the communication must always work). Return `-1` if no path exists between the source and destination.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Minimization of Entangled Links:** The primary goal is to find the shortest path (minimum number of entangled links) between the source and destination nodes.
2.  **Prioritization of High Coherence Nodes:** Among paths with the same number of entangled links, the path that maximizes the *minimum* coherence level of the nodes along the path (excluding the source and destination) should be preferred. If multiple paths have the same minimum coherence level, any of them is acceptable.
3.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle up to 500 nodes within a reasonable time limit.  Consider the time complexity of your algorithm.
4.  **Connectivity:** The network is not necessarily fully connected. It's possible that some nodes may be unreachable from others.
5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the source and destination are the same, where no path exists, or where the input is invalid.
6.  **Correctness:** The solution must be mathematically correct and robust, handling all valid input cases accurately.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
entanglement_matrix = [
    [False, True, True, False, False],
    [True, False, True, False, True],
    [True, True, False, True, False],
    [False, False, True, False, True],
    [False, True, False, True, False]
]
coherence_levels = [80, 90, 70, 60, 50]
source = 0
destination = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
Two possible paths exist:
1.  0 -> 2 -> 4 (2 entangled links, minimum coherence level of intermediate nodes: 70)
2.  0 -> 1 -> 4 (2 entangled links, minimum coherence level of intermediate nodes: 90)

Path 0 -> 1 -> 4 is preferred because it has a higher minimum coherence level (90 > 70) between the intermediate nodes.
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal algorithms and careful consideration of optimization criteria, making it a challenging and sophisticated task. Good luck!

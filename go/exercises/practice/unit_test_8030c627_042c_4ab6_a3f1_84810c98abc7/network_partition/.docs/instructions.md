## Question: Optimal Network Partitioning

**Description:**

You are given a representation of a communication network as an undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents a server, and each edge represents a direct communication link between two servers. Due to security concerns, you need to partition the network into `k` disjoint subnetworks (groups of servers).

Each server has a risk score associated with it, represented by an integer. The risk score of a subnetwork is the sum of the risk scores of all servers within that subnetwork.

The **communication cost** between two subnetworks is defined as the number of edges connecting nodes in the two subnetworks.  An edge contributes to the communication cost if and only if its endpoints belong to different subnetworks.

Your goal is to find a partition of the network into exactly `k` subnetworks such that the difference between the **maximum subnetwork risk score** and the **minimum subnetwork risk score** is minimized, while *also* minimizing the **total communication cost** between the `k` subnetworks.

In other words, you want to balance the risk scores of the subnetworks as much as possible, while simultaneously minimizing the number of communication links between them.

**Input:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of servers in the network.
*   `k`: An integer representing the number of subnetworks to partition the network into.
*   `riskScores`: A slice of integers of length `n`, where `riskScores[i]` represents the risk score of server `i`.
*   `edges`: A slice of slices of integers, where each inner slice `[u, v]` represents an undirected edge between server `u` and server `v` (0-indexed). It's guaranteed that 0 <= u < n, 0 <= v < n, and u != v. The graph may contain multiple edges between the same two nodes.

**Output:**

Return a slice of integers of length `n`, where `result[i]` represents the subnetwork ID (from 0 to k-1) that server `i` belongs to. If no valid partition exists, return an empty slice.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `2 <= k <= min(n, 10)`
*   `1 <= riskScores[i] <= 100`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= n * (n - 1) / 2`

**Optimization Requirement:**

The solution must find the *optimal* partition based on the following priority:

1.  Minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum subnetwork risk scores.
2.  Among partitions with the same risk score difference, minimize the total communication cost between the subnetworks.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   The graph may not be connected.
*   Multiple edges between the same two nodes are allowed (and should be counted correctly for communication cost).
*   Consider the time complexity of your solution. Naive brute-force approaches will likely time out.  Think about using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
*   Ensure your solution handles disconnected components correctly, distributing them amongst the `k` subnetworks.
*   The goal is to find the absolute *best* solution, not just a good one.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, optimization techniques, and careful handling of edge cases. Good luck!

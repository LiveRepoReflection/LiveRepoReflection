Okay, here's a challenging Go programming competition problem, designed to be LeetCode Hard level, incorporating complex elements:

## Project Name

`EventScheduler`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed event scheduler. The scheduler receives event scheduling requests and distributes them across a cluster of worker nodes for execution. Each event has a specific execution time (Unix timestamp in seconds) and a unique ID. The system must ensure that events are executed as close as possible to their scheduled time, even in the face of node failures and network partitions.

Your solution must implement the following functionalities:

1.  **`ScheduleEvent(eventID string, executionTime int64, payload string) error`**: This function receives an event scheduling request. `eventID` is a unique string identifier for the event, `executionTime` is a Unix timestamp representing the desired execution time, and `payload` is a string containing the event's data. The function must ensure that the event is eventually executed. It should return an error if scheduling fails (e.g., invalid `executionTime`). The `executionTime` is guaranteed to be in the future relative to when `ScheduleEvent` is called.

2.  **`CancelEvent(eventID string) error`**: This function cancels a previously scheduled event with the given `eventID`. It should return an error if the event does not exist or if cancellation fails. If the event is already running, it should signal the worker to stop executing.

3.  **`GetNextEvents(currentTime int64, limit int) ([]string, error)`**: This function retrieves a list of `eventID`s that are scheduled to execute at or before the given `currentTime`. The list should be ordered by their execution time (earliest first). The `limit` parameter specifies the maximum number of events to return. This function will primarily be used by the worker nodes to fetch events ready for execution. It should return an error if retrieval fails.

4.  **`MarkEventAsExecuted(eventID string) error`**: This function marks the event as executed. It should return an error if the event does not exist or if marking fails. This function is invoked by a worker node after it successfully executes an event.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The scheduler must be able to handle a large number of concurrent event scheduling requests and a large number of scheduled events (millions or billions).
*   **Reliability:** Events must be executed as close as possible to their scheduled time, even if worker nodes fail or the network experiences partitions. Eventual consistency is acceptable, but strong consistency is preferred where possible within the scalability constraints.
*   **Accuracy:** Events must not be executed before their scheduled time.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to tolerate the failure of individual worker nodes without losing scheduled events.
*   **Idempotency:** The `ScheduleEvent` and `MarkEventAsExecuted` functions should be idempotent. Calling them multiple times with the same event ID should not result in multiple executions or incorrect state.
*   **Efficiency:** The `GetNextEvents` function should be efficient, even with a large number of scheduled events. Aim for logarithmic or better time complexity in the number of events.
*   **Concurrency:** The scheduler must be able to handle concurrent requests safely.
*   **Distribution:** Your solution should be designed to be distributed across multiple nodes. Consider how data will be partitioned and replicated.

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   You can use any appropriate data structures and algorithms to implement the scheduler. Consider using priority queues, distributed databases, consensus algorithms, or other relevant technologies.
*   Think about how to handle time synchronization across the distributed system. Network Time Protocol (NTP) or similar mechanisms may be necessary.
*   Consider using a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication between components.
*   Assume a simple key-value store (e.g., Redis, Etcd) is available for storing metadata and state information.
*   Focus on the core scheduling logic. You don't need to implement the actual event execution or worker node management. Just assume that worker nodes exist and can execute events given the event ID and payload.
*   Consider different trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance when designing your solution.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Handling events scheduled far in the future.
*   Handling events scheduled very close to the current time.
*   Handling a large number of events scheduled for the same time.
*   Handling network partitions and node failures.
*   Handling duplicate event scheduling requests.
*   Handling cancellation requests for events that are already being executed or have already been executed.

This problem requires careful consideration of distributed systems principles, data structures, and algorithms. Good luck!

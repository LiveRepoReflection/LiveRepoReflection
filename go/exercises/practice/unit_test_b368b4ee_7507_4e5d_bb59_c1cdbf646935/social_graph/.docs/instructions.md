Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

**Project Name:** `ScalableSocialGraph`

**Question Description:**

Design and implement a highly scalable social graph service. The service should allow users to follow each other, retrieve followers for a given user, and retrieve users a given user is following (followees).

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Core Functionality:**
    *   `Follow(followerID, followeeID)`:  Establishes a "follows" relationship between two users.  The relationship is directed; `followerID` follows `followeeID`. This operation must be idempotent (calling it multiple times with the same arguments should have the same effect as calling it once).
    *   `Unfollow(followerID, followeeID)`:  Removes a "follows" relationship.  Also idempotent.
    *   `GetFollowers(userID, offset, limit)`: Retrieves a list of follower IDs for a given user, paginated with the provided `offset` and `limit`.  The followers should be returned in ascending order of their IDs.
    *   `GetFollowees(userID, offset, limit)`: Retrieves a list of followee IDs for a given user, paginated with the provided `offset` and `limit`. The followees should be returned in ascending order of their IDs.
    *   `IsFollowing(followerID, followeeID)`: Returns `true` if `followerID` follows `followeeID`, and `false` otherwise.

2.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle:
    *   A very large number of users (billions).
    *   A very large number of follows relationships (trillions).
    *   High read and write throughput (thousands/millions of operations per second).
    *   Minimize latency and ensure eventual consistency.

3.  **Data Storage:**
    *   You are free to choose the data storage mechanism (e.g., in-memory, relational database, NoSQL database, graph database, distributed cache, etc.). Justify your choice based on scalability, performance, and consistency requirements.  Consider sharding and replication strategies.

4.  **Optimizations:**
    *   Optimize for both read and write performance.  Consider caching strategies (e.g., in-memory cache, CDN) to reduce database load.
    *   Efficiently handle users with a very large number of followers/followees (the "celebrity problem").  Avoid solutions that degrade linearly with the number of relationships.

5.  **Concurrency:** The service must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests correctly.

6.  **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling and logging. Return appropriate error codes for invalid input or unexpected conditions.

7.  **API Design:**  Define clear and concise interfaces for the functions above.

8.  **Constraints:**
    *   User IDs are 64-bit unsigned integers.
    *   `offset` and `limit` are non-negative integers.
    *   The number of followers/followees returned by `GetFollowers` and `GetFollowees` must not exceed `limit`.
    *   Assume that there is no user deletion.

9. **Bonus Challenge**:
    * Add a `GetMutualFollowees(userID, otherUserID, offset, limit)` function that retrieves a list of users that both `userID` and `otherUserID` are following, paginated with offset and limit. Optimize this function for performance.
    * Add rate limiting to the Follow and Unfollow operations to prevent abuse.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the implementation.
*   Scalability and performance of the system.
*   Efficiency of the algorithms used.
*   Appropriateness of the data storage choices and sharding/replication strategies.
*   Clarity and maintainability of the code.
*   Robustness of error handling and concurrency control.

This problem requires the candidate to think about system design, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency in a practical, real-world scenario. There isn't one single "correct" answer, and the candidate's design choices and justifications are important factors in the evaluation. It also forces the candidate to consider various trade-offs.

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description designed to be LeetCode Hard level, focusing on system design, algorithmic efficiency, and intricate edge cases.

## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter with Weighted Buckets

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service in Go. This rate limiter needs to handle a massive influx of requests from various clients. Each client is identified by a unique `client_id` (string). The rate limiter must control the number of requests each client can make within a given time window.

However, this is not a simple counter-based rate limiter. Instead, you will implement a weighted bucket approach with multiple tiers of buckets. Each bucket tier has different capacity and refill rates. Requests consume capacity from the buckets, starting from the smallest (fastest refill) to the largest (slowest refill).

**Specifics:**

1.  **Bucket Tiers:** The rate limiter should support a configurable number of bucket tiers (`N`). Each tier `i` has a `capacity_i` (integer) and `refill_rate_i` (integer, requests per second). Tier 0 has the smallest capacity and fastest refill rate, and tier N-1 has the largest capacity and slowest refill rate.

2.  **Weighted Consumption:** Each request from a client consumes a `weight` (integer). The rate limiter must attempt to satisfy the request by consuming capacity from the buckets in ascending order of tiers (0 to N-1).

    *   If tier `i` has enough capacity to satisfy the remaining `weight`, the required capacity is consumed from that tier, and the process is complete.
    *   If tier `i` does *not* have enough capacity, all available capacity from tier `i` is consumed, the remaining `weight` is updated, and the process continues to tier `i+1`.
    *   If after attempting to consume from all N tiers, there is still remaining `weight`, the request is rejected.

3.  **Refill Mechanism:** Each bucket tier `i` refills its capacity at its specified `refill_rate_i` per second. The refill should be continuous and accurate, not discrete (e.g., using token bucket algorithm with fractional tokens).

4.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple clients efficiently.

5.  **Persistence:** The rate limiter state (current capacity of each bucket for each client) needs to be persistent. You can use an in-memory store for simplicity during development, but your design should be easily adaptable to use a distributed key-value store (like Redis or Memcached) for production deployment.

6.  **Distribution:**  While you are not required to implement the *actual* distribution of the service across multiple nodes, your design should consider how the rate limiter state would be synchronized or sharded across multiple nodes to handle high request volume.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement the core rate limiting logic with the weighted bucket approach.
*   Provide a clear API for clients to check if a request is allowed (including client ID and request weight).  The API should return a boolean indicating whether the request is allowed, and potentially the remaining capacity in each bucket tier.
*   Design your solution with performance in mind.  Optimize for low latency and high throughput.
*   Handle edge cases gracefully, such as invalid client IDs, negative weights, zero capacities, etc.
*   Consider data structures and algorithms that enable efficient consumption and refill of bucket capacity.  Think about how to avoid race conditions when multiple requests arrive for the same client concurrently.
*   Your code should be well-structured, commented, and easy to understand.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of bucket tiers `N` can be between 1 and 10.
*   `capacity_i` and `refill_rate_i` for each tier can be between 1 and 1,000,000.
*   Request `weight` can be between 1 and 10,000.
*   The service must handle at least 10,000 requests per second with reasonable latency (e.g., < 1ms on average).
*   The solution should be memory efficient and avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrent programming in Go, data structures, and system design principles.  It also emphasizes the importance of careful optimization and handling various edge cases. Good luck!

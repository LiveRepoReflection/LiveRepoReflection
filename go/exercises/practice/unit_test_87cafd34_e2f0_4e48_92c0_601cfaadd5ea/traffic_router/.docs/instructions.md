## Question: Optimal Traffic Flow Routing

**Description:**

A major metropolitan area is experiencing severe traffic congestion. As a brilliant software engineer, you are tasked with designing an intelligent traffic routing system to minimize the overall commute time for all drivers.

The city's road network can be represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents an intersection, and each directed edge represents a road segment connecting two intersections.  Each road segment has a *capacity*, representing the maximum number of vehicles that can travel on that segment per unit of time (e.g., vehicles per minute). Each road segment also has a *base travel time*, which is the time it takes to traverse the segment when it is at zero capacity.

Your system receives real-time data about the origin and destination of a large number of vehicles.  Each vehicle also has a *priority* level.  Higher priority vehicles (e.g., emergency vehicles, public transport) should experience lower latency.

When the number of vehicles traveling on a road segment approaches its capacity, the travel time increases.  Model this relationship as follows:  The actual travel time on a road segment is equal to the base travel time multiplied by `(1 + (flow / capacity)^2)`, where `flow` is the current number of vehicles using the segment per unit of time.

Your task is to design a routing algorithm that dynamically assigns routes to incoming vehicles to minimize the *weighted average commute time* across all vehicles.  The weight for each vehicle is its priority. The system needs to handle a continuous stream of vehicle requests.

**Input:**

*   A directed graph represented as an adjacency list. Each edge in the graph is described by a tuple `(destination_node, capacity, base_travel_time)`. Node IDs are integers.
*   A continuous stream of vehicle requests. Each request is described by a tuple `(origin_node, destination_node, priority)`, where `priority` is an integer representing the vehicle's priority (higher is better). Assume requests arrive one at a time.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 10,000 nodes and 50,000 edges).
*   The number of concurrent vehicle requests can be very high.
*   The system must respond to each vehicle request reasonably quickly.  The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle a high volume of requests in real-time.
*   The priority values are in the range [1, 10].
*   The capacity and base_travel_time are positive integers.

**Output:**

For each vehicle request, output a list of node IDs representing the optimal route for that vehicle.  The route should start at the origin node and end at the destination node.

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** The route must be a valid path in the graph, and it must lead from the origin to the destination.
2.  **Weighted Average Commute Time:** The lower the weighted average commute time for all vehicles routed by your system, the better.  The weighted average is calculated as `sum(priority_i * travel_time_i) / sum(priority_i)` for all vehicles `i`.
3.  **Runtime Performance:** The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle a high volume of requests in real-time. The system must respond to each vehicle request within a reasonable time limit.
4.  **Scalability:** The solution should scale well with the size of the graph and the number of vehicle requests.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about how to balance exploration (finding potentially better routes) with exploitation (using known good routes).
*   Consider how to handle changes in traffic flow as more vehicles are routed.
*   Explore different pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A\*, Bellman-Ford) and how they can be adapted to this dynamic routing problem.
*   Think about data structures that can efficiently represent the graph and track traffic flow.
*   Consider using heuristics to improve performance, especially for large graphs.
*   Explore methods to efficiently update travel times on road segments based on changing traffic conditions.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and system design considerations. Good luck!

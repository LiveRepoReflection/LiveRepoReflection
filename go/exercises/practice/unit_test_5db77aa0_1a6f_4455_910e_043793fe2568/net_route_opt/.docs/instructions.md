Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test advanced skills:

**Project Name:** `OptimizedNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimized routing algorithm for a data center network. The data center consists of `N` servers (nodes) interconnected by a network. The network topology is represented as a weighted, undirected graph. The weight of an edge represents the latency between two directly connected servers.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology, a source server `src`, a destination server `dest`, and a maximum allowed latency `maxLatency`, finds a set of `K` *disjoint paths* (paths with no common nodes, excluding the source and destination) between `src` and `dest` such that the latency of each path is *no more than* `maxLatency`.

Furthermore, you need to *maximize* the number of disjoint paths `K` found.  In other words, find the largest possible `K`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of servers in the data center (numbered from 0 to N-1).
*   `edges`: A slice of slices of integers, representing the weighted edges of the graph. Each inner slice has the form `[u, v, weight]`, where `u` and `v` are the server IDs connected by the edge, and `weight` is the latency of the edge (positive integer).
*   `src`: An integer representing the ID of the source server.
*   `dest`: An integer representing the ID of the destination server.
*   `maxLatency`: An integer representing the maximum allowed latency for each path.

**Output:**

*   A slice of slices of integers, representing the `K` disjoint paths. Each inner slice represents a path and contains the server IDs in the order they appear in the path, starting with `src` and ending with `dest`. If no such set of paths exists, return an empty slice (`[]`).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Disjoint Paths:** The paths in the output must be node-disjoint, meaning they cannot share any intermediate nodes (nodes other than `src` and `dest`).

2.  **Latency Limit:** The total latency (sum of edge weights) of each path must be less than or equal to `maxLatency`.

3.  **Maximization:** You must find the *maximum* number of disjoint paths that satisfy the latency constraint.

4.  **Efficiency:**  Your solution should be efficient enough to handle large networks (up to `N = 500` servers and a large number of edges).  Consider the time and space complexity of your algorithm.  Brute-force solutions will likely time out.

5.  **Error Handling:** The input `src` and `dest` will be valid server IDs (between 0 and N-1). It is guaranteed that `src != dest`.

6.  **Graph Properties:** The graph is undirected and can contain cycles. There can be multiple edges between two nodes, but you should treat them as distinct paths, and consider their weights. The graph will be connected enough that some path from `src` to `dest` always exists.

7.  **Real-world Considerations:** Consider that in a real-world network, latency is a critical factor.  Your solution should prioritize finding paths with lower latency while still maximizing the number of disjoint paths.

8.  **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If multiple sets of `K` disjoint paths exist, any one of them is a valid solution.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 5], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3, 6], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 4], [1, 4, 8], [2, 4, 7]]
src = 0
dest = 4
maxLatency = 15

//Possible Valid Output (one possible solution):
//[[0, 2, 3, 4], [0, 1, 4]]
// Explanation:
// Path 1: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (latency: 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 <= 15)
// Path 2: 0 -> 1 -> 4 (latency: 5 + 8 = 13 <= 15)
// These paths are disjoint (except for the source and destination) and within the latency limit.
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints. Good luck!

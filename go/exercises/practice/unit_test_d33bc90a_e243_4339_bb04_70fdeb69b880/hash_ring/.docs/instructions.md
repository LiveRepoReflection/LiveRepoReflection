Okay, I'm ready. Here is a problem description aimed at being a challenging LeetCode Hard level Go coding problem.

**Project Name:** `consistent-hashing`

**Question Description:**

You are designing a distributed key-value store.  A crucial component is the consistent hashing algorithm that determines which server node is responsible for storing or retrieving a given key.  Your task is to implement a highly efficient and scalable consistent hashing ring.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Hash Ring:** Implement a consistent hashing ring using a technique like the Jump Consistent Hash or a variation of it. The ring should be able to handle a large number of nodes (e.g., up to 1,000,000 nodes) and keys efficiently.

2.  **Node Addition/Removal:** Implement functions to add and remove nodes from the hash ring.  Node addition and removal should minimize the number of keys that need to be remapped to other nodes.  The redistribution of keys after a node is added or removed is a critical performance bottleneck. You must optimize this process.

3.  **Key Lookup:** Implement a function that, given a key, returns the responsible node in the ring. This lookup should be extremely fast (ideally O(1) or close to it).

4.  **Virtual Nodes (Shards):** Implement the concept of virtual nodes (shards). Each physical node can be represented by multiple virtual nodes on the ring. This helps to distribute keys more evenly and improves fault tolerance.  The number of virtual nodes per physical node should be configurable.

5.  **Load Balancing:** The hash ring should aim for good load balancing across the nodes. While a perfectly even distribution is difficult to achieve, the distribution should be as close to uniform as possible, even when nodes are added and removed dynamically.  You will need to monitor and potentially rebalance the ring periodically.

6.  **Concurrency:** The hash ring should be thread-safe, allowing concurrent read and write operations (node additions/removals, key lookups) from multiple goroutines. Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., mutexes, RWMutexes) to ensure data consistency.

7.  **Data Migration:** Implement a mechanism for migrating keys when nodes are added or removed. This could involve returning a list of keys that need to be moved from one node to another.  The data migration process itself doesn't need to be part of the core consistent hashing algorithm, but you need to provide the necessary information for an external system to perform the migration.

8.  **Constraints:**

    *   The key space is the set of all strings.
    *   Node identifiers are strings.
    *   The number of virtual nodes per physical node is configurable and can be different for each physical node.
    *   The solution must be highly performant, especially for key lookups. Latency is a key concern.
    *   Node addition and removal should be reasonably efficient, minimizing the number of keys that need to be remapped.
    *   The solution must be thread-safe.

9.  **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling, including handling cases where a node is not found or when there are conflicts during node addition/removal.

10. **Optimizations:** Consider caching strategies, pre-computation, and other techniques to optimize the performance of the hash ring. Document any trade-offs made in terms of memory usage, complexity, and performance.

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems principles. It also encourages thinking about practical aspects like load balancing, fault tolerance, and data migration. Good luck!

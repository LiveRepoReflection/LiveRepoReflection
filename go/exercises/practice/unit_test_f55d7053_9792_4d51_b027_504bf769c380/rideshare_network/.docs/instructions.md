## Question: Decentralized Ridesharing Network

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a core component of a decentralized ridesharing network. This network aims to connect riders and drivers directly, eliminating the need for a central authority and ensuring fair pricing and transparency.

The network consists of `n` nodes, each representing a driver or rider. Each node maintains a local view of the network, storing information about other nearby nodes (neighbors) and their current location, capacity (for drivers), and ride requests (for riders).

**Specifically, you need to implement the following functionality:**

1.  **Node Discovery:** Given a starting node and a maximum distance `d`, find all reachable nodes within that distance. The distance between two directly connected nodes is assumed to be 1. This simulates the limited radio range of nodes in the decentralized network. The network is represented by an adjacency list where keys are node IDs (integers) and values are a slice of their neighbor node IDs.
2.  **Ride Matching:** Given a rider node and a list of driver nodes within range (obtained from Node Discovery), determine the optimal driver to assign the ride to. "Optimal" is defined as minimizing the total travel time. Total travel time is calculated as the sum of the driver's current distance to the rider, plus the rider's destination distance.
    *   Assume you have a `Distance` function available. `Distance(startNode, endNode)` returns the distance (in arbitrary units, but consistent) between any two nodes in the network. This function is external and can be considered to have O(1) complexity.
3.  **Network Partitioning Detection:** Given the network adjacency list, determine if the network is fully connected. A fully connected network means that any node can reach any other node through a series of connections. If the network is not fully connected, identify the number of distinct connected components. This is important for ensuring the network remains functional even with some nodes dropping out.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The network can potentially contain a large number of nodes (up to 10^5). Your solution should be efficient enough to handle large networks within reasonable time limits.
*   **Efficiency:**  Minimize computational complexity in all three functionalities. In particular, optimize the ride matching process considering there might be many drivers within range.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no drivers are within range for a rider, where the network is completely disconnected, or where node IDs are not sequential.
*   **Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures to represent the network and node information. Efficient lookups and traversal are crucial.
*   **Concurrency (Optional):**  Consider how your solution could be made concurrent to improve performance, especially for node discovery and network partitioning detection. This is not strictly required for a correct solution but can be a significant performance boost.
*   **No External Libraries (Mostly):** You are allowed to use standard Go libraries, but try to avoid using external specialized graph libraries unless absolutely necessary. The goal is to assess your understanding of graph algorithms and data structures. You can assume packages like `fmt`, `math`, `container/heap` are available but should declare dependency on them.

**Input:**

*   `adjacencyList`:  `map[int][]int`  -  Represents the network connectivity. The key is the node ID (integer), and the value is a list of its neighbor node IDs.
*   `startNode`: `int` - The starting node ID for node discovery.
*   `maxDistance`: `int` - The maximum distance for node discovery.
*   `riderNode`: `int` - The rider node ID for ride matching.
*   `driverNodes`: `[]int` - A slice of driver node IDs within range for ride matching (obtained from node discovery).
*   `riderDestination`: `int` - The rider's destination node ID.
*   `Distance(startNode, endNode int) int`: Assume this function is available and returns the distance between two nodes.

**Output:**

*   `Node Discovery`: `[]int` - A slice of node IDs reachable from the `startNode` within `maxDistance`. The order of the nodes doesn't matter.
*   `Ride Matching`: `int` - The node ID of the optimal driver to assign the ride to, or -1 if no driver is suitable.
*   `Network Partitioning Detection`: `int` - The number of distinct connected components in the network. If the network is fully connected, the output should be 1.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph traversal algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

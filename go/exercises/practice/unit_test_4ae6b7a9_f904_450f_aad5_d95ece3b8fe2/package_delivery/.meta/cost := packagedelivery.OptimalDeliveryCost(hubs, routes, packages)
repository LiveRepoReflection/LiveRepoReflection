## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(P * (E + V log V)) where P is the number of package groups, E is the number of routes, and V is the number of hubs. This represents running Dijkstra's algorithm for each unique source-destination pair.
- Space Complexity: O(V + E) for storing the graph and algorithm data structures.

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed event stream processing system.  Imagine a scenario where numerous sensors are deployed across a wide geographical area, each emitting a stream of events.  These events need to be collected, processed, and analyzed in real-time.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of sensors (potentially millions) and a high volume of events (potentially billions per day).

2.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to failures.  Individual sensor failures, network outages, or processing node failures should not disrupt the overall system's operation.

3.  **Ordered Processing:** For certain critical events, the system needs to guarantee that events from the same sensor are processed in the order they were generated.  This is crucial for maintaining causality in the analysis.  However, global ordering across *all* sensors is not required.

4.  **Real-time Analytics:** The system should provide the capability to perform real-time analytics on the event stream. Specifically, you need to implement a sliding window aggregation function.  Given a sensor ID, a window size (in seconds), and an aggregation function (e.g., sum, average, maximum), the system should continuously compute the aggregation result for the events received from that sensor within the specified time window.

5.  **Dynamic Sensor Registration/Deregistration:** Sensors should be able to dynamically register with and deregister from the system. The system should adapt to these changes without manual intervention.

6.  **Resource Constraints:** The system operates under resource constraints. Each processing node has limited CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. Efficient resource utilization is essential.

**Implementation Details:**

*   You need to implement the core components of the event stream processing system, including:

    *   **Sensor Interface:**  A mechanism for sensors to send events to the system.
    *   **Event Router:** A component responsible for distributing events to appropriate processing nodes.
    *   **Processing Node:** A component that receives events, stores them (temporarily), and performs the sliding window aggregation.
    *   **Query Interface:** A mechanism for users to query the system for the results of the sliding window aggregations.

*   You are free to choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient event storage and processing. Consider trade-offs between memory usage, processing speed, and implementation complexity.

*   You need to implement at least three different types of aggregation functions: `Sum`, `Average`, and `Maximum`.  The system should be extensible to support new aggregation functions in the future.

*   The solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests correctly.

**Constraints:**

*   The sliding window aggregation should be implemented with optimal time complexity.  Naive implementations that iterate over the entire window for each computation will not be accepted.
*   The system must minimize end-to-end latency for event processing.
*   The solution should be well-documented and easy to understand.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement support for out-of-order events.
*   Implement a mechanism for persisting events to durable storage for replay in case of system failures.
*   Implement a more sophisticated event routing strategy that considers the load and resource availability of processing nodes.
*   Implement a distributed caching mechanism to improve query performance.

This problem is intentionally open-ended to allow for creativity and exploration of different design choices. The primary goal is to demonstrate your ability to design and implement a scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient distributed system for real-time event stream processing. Good luck!

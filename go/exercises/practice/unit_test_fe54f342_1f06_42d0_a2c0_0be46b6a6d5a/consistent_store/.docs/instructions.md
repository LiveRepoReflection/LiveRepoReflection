## Distributed Key-Value Store with Consistent Hashing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed key-value store using consistent hashing.  The system should be able to handle a large number of requests for storing and retrieving data. The key-value store will be distributed across a cluster of servers. When servers get added or removed, the system should minimize the data movement.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Data Storage:** Implement a key-value store that can store arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values.
2.  **Consistent Hashing:**  Use consistent hashing to distribute keys across the servers.  The hash ring should be large enough to ensure even distribution. You must use a cryptographically secure hash function to ensure good distribution even with adversarial keys.
3.  **Server Join/Leave:** The system must handle servers joining and leaving the cluster gracefully. When a server joins, it should take over a portion of the existing keyspace. When a server leaves, its keyspace should be redistributed among the remaining servers. Data migration should be minimized during these operations.
4.  **Data Replication (Optional but Recommended):** Implement data replication to improve availability and fault tolerance. Each key should be replicated on `N` servers, where `N` is a configurable parameter. The `N` replicas should be located on adjacent servers on the hash ring.
5.  **Concurrency:**  The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests efficiently.
6.  **Fault Tolerance:**  The system should be able to tolerate server failures without losing data, especially when combined with the replication feature.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Servers:** Assume you have a set of servers, each identified by a unique ID (e.g., an integer or a string).  Each server has limited storage capacity.
*   **Hash Ring:** Implement a hash ring with a sufficiently large number of virtual nodes (e.g., 1024 or more) per server. This helps to distribute the keys evenly across the servers.
*   **Key Assignment:** When a key is inserted, hash the key and map it to a position on the hash ring. The server responsible for that position is the one that stores the key.
*   **Server Discovery:**  Implement a simple server discovery mechanism. You can assume a centralized configuration server (e.g., using etcd or a similar service) that maintains the list of available servers and their locations on the hash ring.
*   **Data Migration:** When a server joins or leaves, implement data migration to transfer the appropriate keys between servers. Minimize the amount of data that needs to be moved.
*   **API:** Implement the following API:

    *   `Put(key []byte, value []byte) error`: Stores the key-value pair.
    *   `Get(key []byte) ([]byte, error)`: Retrieves the value associated with the key.
    *   `Remove(key []byte) error`: Removes the key-value pair.
    *   `AddServer(serverID string) error`: Adds a new server to the cluster.
    *   `RemoveServer(serverID string) error`: Removes a server from the cluster.

**Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of requests.
*   **Efficiency:**  The `Put`, `Get`, and `Remove` operations should be efficient. Data migration during server join/leave should also be optimized.
*   **Consistency:** Implement strong eventual consistency. After a server leaves, `Get` operations for keys that were on that server may return an error temporarily until the keys are fully migrated.
*   **Memory Usage:** The system should use memory efficiently.
*   **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
*   **No external dependencies:** Outside of commonly used go packages, do not use any external dependencies to complete this task.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   **Data Migration Strategy:** Optimize the data migration process during server join/leave to minimize downtime and network traffic. Consider using techniques like range partitioning or incremental migration.
*   **Cache:** Implement a cache on each server to improve the performance of `Get` operations for frequently accessed keys.
*   **Batching:** Batch `Put` and `Remove` operations to improve throughput.
*   **Concurrency Control:**  Use appropriate concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, read-write locks) to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, consistent hashing, concurrency, and optimization techniques.  It is a challenging problem that will test your ability to design and implement a robust and scalable key-value store.

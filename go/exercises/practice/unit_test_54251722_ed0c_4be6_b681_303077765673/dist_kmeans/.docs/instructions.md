### Question Description

Implement a distributed version of the K-Means clustering algorithm. Your task is to process a large dataset of points (represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space) spread across multiple worker nodes and efficiently compute the K cluster centers.

**Input:**

*   `numNodes int`: The number of worker nodes participating in the clustering.
*   `nodeID int`: A unique identifier for the current node (0-indexed, i.e., from 0 to `numNodes-1`).
*   `data [][]float64`: A slice of data points assigned to the current node. Each data point is a slice of `float64` representing a vector in a D-dimensional space. Assume all data points have the same dimensionality.
*   `k int`: The desired number of clusters.
*   `threshold float64`: A convergence threshold. The algorithm should stop iterating when the maximum change in any cluster center's coordinates between two iterations is less than or equal to this threshold.
*   `maxIterations int`: The maximum number of iterations the algorithm should run for, even if the convergence threshold isn't met.

**Output:**

*   `[][]float64`: A slice of K cluster centers. Each cluster center is a slice of `float64` representing a vector in the same D-dimensional space as the input data points.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Processing:** You **must** simulate a distributed environment. While you don't need to use actual network communication, you must structure your code as if each node is running independently and can only communicate by sending/receiving data to/from a central coordinator.  Specifically, implement functions `NodeCompute` and `CoordinatorAggregate` to simulate the work of each node and the coordinator.

2.  **Communication:** Model inter-node communication using channels.  The `NodeCompute` function should return its local contribution (sum of points assigned to each cluster and the number of points) to the central coordinator via a channel. The coordinator then aggregates these contributions and broadcasts new centroids to all worker nodes.

3.  **Efficiency:**  The dataset can be very large. Optimize your solution for both memory usage and computational speed.  Avoid unnecessary data copying. Consider using techniques like mini-batch K-Means or efficient data structures for distance calculations (although full implementation of these is not required if it would significantly increase complexity).

4.  **Initialization:**  Implement K-Means++ initialization to choose the initial cluster centers.  This is crucial for convergence and avoiding poor local optima.

5.  **Handling Empty Clusters:**  If a cluster becomes empty during an iteration, re-initialize its center randomly from the existing data points.

6.  **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors gracefully, such as invalid input parameters (e.g., `k` > number of data points, inconsistent data dimensionality) and return appropriate error values (or panic with a descriptive message during testing).

7.  **Deterministic Results:** Despite the distributed nature and random initialization, the final cluster centers should be relatively consistent across multiple runs with the same input data and parameters.  This implies careful seeding of the random number generator.

8.  **Scalability:** The code should be designed with scalability in mind. The data on each node could potentially be very large.

**Specific Functions to Implement:**

*   `NodeCompute(nodeID int, data [][]float64, k int, centroids [][]float64, threshold float64) ([][]float64, []int)`:  This function performs the K-Means computation on a single node. It takes the node's data, the number of clusters `k`, and the current centroids as input. It returns the sum of the points assigned to each cluster and the number of points assigned to each cluster.
*   `CoordinatorAggregate(nodeResults [][][]float64, nodeCounts [][]int, k int, numNodes int, dimensionality int) ([][]float64, float64)`: This function aggregates the results from all the worker nodes. It receives the sum of points and counts for each cluster from each node and calculates the new centroids. It also returns the maximum change in centroid coordinates.

**Hidden Test Cases will include:**

*   Large datasets with high dimensionality.
*   Scenarios with a high number of clusters.
*   Cases where some clusters might become empty during iterations.
*   Cases with a small convergence threshold, requiring many iterations.

This problem requires a strong understanding of the K-Means algorithm, distributed computing principles (even if simulated), efficient data structures, and Go's concurrency features. Good luck!

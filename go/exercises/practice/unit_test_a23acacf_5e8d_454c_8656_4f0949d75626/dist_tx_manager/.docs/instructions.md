Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Manager

**Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction manager for a key-value store.  This transaction manager must support ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - albeit in a simplified, in-memory form).

Imagine you have multiple independent key-value store instances (simulated within a single process for this problem).  Your transaction manager needs to coordinate operations (reads and writes) across these instances to ensure data consistency, even in the face of potential failures.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Key-Value Store Abstraction:**  You will be provided with (or you can define a simple) interface representing a key-value store.  This interface will have methods like `Get(key string) (string, error)` and `Set(key string, value string) error`. Assume these key-value stores are unreliable (e.g., they might experience temporary network partitions or node failures). You will also need an `Available()` method to check if the Key-Value store instance is available.

2.  **Transaction Interface:**  Implement a `Transaction` interface with the following methods:
    *   `Begin() error`: Starts a new transaction.  Assign a unique transaction ID.
    *   `Get(storeID int, key string) (string, error)`: Reads a value from a specific key-value store instance (`storeID`) within the transaction.  All reads should be repeatable for the duration of the transaction (Read Committed Isolation Level).
    *   `Set(storeID int, key string, value string) error`: Sets a value in a specific key-value store instance (`storeID`) within the transaction. Values should not be set immediately, but buffered in-memory.
    *   `Commit() error`: Attempts to commit the transaction. This involves applying all buffered writes to the respective key-value stores using a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.
    *   `Rollback() error`: Rolls back the transaction, discarding any buffered writes.
    *   `GetTransactionID() string`: Returns the unique transaction ID.

3.  **Transaction Manager:** Implement a `TransactionManager` that manages the lifecycle of transactions. It should include methods like:
    *   `NewTransaction() (Transaction, error)`: Creates and returns a new transaction.
    *   `RegisterStore(store KeyValueStore) int`: Registers a KeyValueStore instance with the transaction manager, returning a unique store ID.
    *   `GetStore(storeID int) (KeyValueStore, error)`: Retrieves a registered KeyValueStore instance.

4.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** Implement a 2PC protocol for the `Commit()` operation.  This will involve a "prepare" phase and a "commit/abort" phase.  The prepare phase should check the availability of all key-value stores involved in the transaction. If ANY store is unavailable, the entire transaction MUST be rolled back.

5.  **Concurrency:**  The transaction manager must be thread-safe, allowing multiple concurrent transactions to be active at the same time.  Use appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

6.  **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling. Return appropriate error types when operations fail (e.g., store unavailable, key not found, transaction already committed/rolled back).

7.  **Isolation:** Implement Read Committed Isolation Level. A transaction can read uncommitted data from other transactions.

**Constraints:**

*   **In-Memory:** All data (transaction metadata, buffered writes) must be stored in memory.  No external databases or persistent storage are allowed.
*   **Simulated Unreliability:**  You can simulate key-value store failures by having the `Available()` method randomly return `false` with some probability.  Or, introduce a delay to simulate network latency.
*   **Limited Scope:** Focus on the core transaction management logic.  You don't need to implement advanced features like distributed deadlock detection or recovery mechanisms.
*   **Efficiency:**  The solution should be reasonably efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time.  Avoid unnecessary data copying or complex algorithms.

**Scoring Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the transaction manager correctly implement ACID properties?
*   Concurrency Safety:  Is the transaction manager thread-safe?
*   Error Handling:  Does the solution handle errors gracefully?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Efficiency:  Is the solution reasonably efficient?

**Example Scenario:**

1.  Register three key-value store instances.
2.  Start two concurrent transactions (Tx1 and Tx2).
3.  Tx1 writes "value1" to key "keyA" in store 1.
4.  Tx2 reads "keyA" from store 1 (it might see "value1" if Tx1 hasn't committed yet).
5.  Tx2 writes "value2" to key "keyB" in store 2.
6.  Tx1 commits.
7.  Tx2 attempts to commit.  If store 2 is unavailable during the prepare phase, Tx2 must be rolled back.

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, distributed systems, and transaction management principles.  It is designed to be challenging and to test the candidate's ability to design and implement complex software systems. Good luck!

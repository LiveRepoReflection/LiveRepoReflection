Okay, here is a challenging Go coding problem.

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service. This service must be able to handle a high volume of requests and prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a user (identified by a unique key) can make within a given time window.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must function correctly across multiple instances (e.g., servers) to avoid single points of failure and handle increased load.

2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The service should allow for configurable rate limits (e.g., X requests per Y seconds) on a per-user (identified by key) or global basis.

3.  **Atomic Operations:**  When multiple requests arrive concurrently, the rate limiter must use atomic operations to ensure accuracy and prevent race conditions.

4.  **Persistence:** The rate limiter must persist the request counts, even after the server restarts.

5.  **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient in terms of both memory usage and request processing time.  Minimize latency.

6.  **Scalability:**  The system should be designed to scale horizontally to handle an increasing number of users and requests.

7.  **Fault Tolerance:** The service should be fault-tolerant. If one of the instances fails, the other instances should continue to operate correctly.

8.  **Extensibility:** Your implementation should be easy to extend to support different storage backends or rate-limiting algorithms.

9.  **Metrics:**  Expose metrics (e.g., requests allowed, requests rejected, average latency) for monitoring and performance analysis.

**Constraints:**

*   You must use Go for your implementation.
*   You can use any open-source Go libraries, but be mindful of their performance characteristics.
*   You can use an external storage system (e.g., Redis, Memcached, a database) for persistence and atomic operations.  Consider the tradeoffs of different storage options.  The choice of storage system should be configurable.
*   Assume a large number of unique users (millions or billions).
*   Assume a high request rate (thousands or tens of thousands of requests per second).
*   The service must be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.
*   The time window for rate limiting should be able to be configured to seconds, minutes or hours.

**Specifically, you are required to implement the following functions:**

*   `NewRateLimiter(config RateLimiterConfig) (*RateLimiter, error)`:  Creates a new rate limiter instance with the given configuration.
*   `Allow(key string) (bool, error)`: Checks if a request from the given key is allowed based on the configured rate limit.  Returns `true` if allowed, `false` otherwise.  Also returns an error if an issue arises during rate limiting.
*   `Reset(key string) error`: Resets the rate limit counter for a given key. This could be useful for administrative or testing purposes.
*   `Close() error`: Closes the rate limiter instance and releases any resources.

**RateLimiterConfig should include at least the following fields:**

*   `Limit int`: The maximum number of requests allowed within the time window.
*   `Window time.Duration`: The length of the time window (e.g., 1 second, 1 minute, 1 hour).
*   `StorageType string`: The type of storage to use (e.g., "redis", "memcached", "inmemory").
*   `StorageAddress string`: The address of the storage server (e.g., "localhost:6379" for Redis).

This problem challenges your knowledge of distributed systems, concurrency, data structures, algorithms, and Go programming best practices.  It requires you to think about trade-offs between performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity. Good luck!

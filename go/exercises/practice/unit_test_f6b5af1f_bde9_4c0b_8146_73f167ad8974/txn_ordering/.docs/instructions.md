Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills.

## Problem: Decentralized Transaction Ordering

### Description

You are tasked with designing a system for ordering transactions in a decentralized, permissioned blockchain network.  This network consists of `N` nodes, each maintaining its own local view of pending transactions.  Due to network latency and varying processing speeds, nodes may receive transactions in different orders.  The goal is to implement a consensus mechanism to establish a globally consistent and fair transaction order.

**Input:**

Each node receives a stream of transactions. A transaction is represented by a struct:

```go
type Transaction struct {
    ID        string // Unique transaction ID (UUID)
    Timestamp int64  // Unix timestamp when the transaction was created
    Sender    string // Public key of the sender
    Data      string // Arbitrary transaction data
    Priority  int    // Priority value assigned to the transaction by the sender. Higher value means higher priority.
}
```

Each node also has a unique ID:

```go
type Node struct {
    ID       string // Unique Node ID (UUID)
    // Other node-specific data
}
```

Your function will receive:

1.  `nodeID string`: The ID of the current node.
2.  `transactionStream <-chan Transaction`: A channel that streams transactions to the node.  This channel will eventually close, signaling the end of the transaction stream.
3.  `nodeList []string`: A list of all nodeIDs in the network.

**Output:**

Your function must return a `[]Transaction` representing the globally agreed-upon order of transactions.  The transactions returned MUST be a subset of all the transactions received from `transactionStream` channel.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Fairness:** Transactions should be ordered primarily by timestamp, then by priority, and finally by node ID (lexicographical order) to break ties. A transaction with an earlier timestamp should be processed before one with a later timestamp. In the event of a timestamp collision, the transaction with the higher priority should be processed first. If the timestamp and priority are identical, the transaction originated from the node with a lexicographically smaller node ID should be prioritized.

2.  **Decentralization:** The ordering algorithm must be implementable in a decentralized manner.  While you're writing the solution for a single node, imagine the entire network is running the same code and reaching consensus through communication. This communication aspect is abstracted away for this problem; you only need to focus on the ordering logic *as if* it were part of a larger consensus mechanism.

3.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be reasonably efficient in terms of both time and memory complexity.  Consider the potential for a large number of transactions.  Aim for a solution that can handle a significant transaction load without excessive resource consumption.

4.  **Completeness:** You must ensure that all transactions received by the node are eventually considered for inclusion in the final ordered list, unless they are deemed invalid or duplicates.

5.  **Robustness:**  The solution should be robust to potentially malicious behavior or noisy data. It is acceptable to omit transactions if there is sufficient evidence of malicious behavior. For example, nodes may send conflicting transactions with the same ID, or transactions with invalid timestamps (e.g. future timestamps). Handle these cases gracefully and provide an explanation of your strategy.

6.  **Determinism:** Given the same set of transactions and node list, all nodes should ideally arrive at the same final order.

7.  **Real-world constraints:** This problem could be applied in a real-world scenario such as implementing a blockchain to manage transactions and prevent double-spending.

**Specifically, you must implement the following Go function:**

```go
// OrderTransactions orders transactions based on timestamp, priority, and node ID.
// It simulates a decentralized consensus by applying ordering rules fairly and efficiently.
func OrderTransactions(nodeID string, transactionStream <-chan Transaction, nodeList []string) []Transaction {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The primary criterion.  Does the function produce the correct transaction order according to the rules?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the solution reasonably efficient in terms of time and memory? (O(n log n) or better is expected)
*   **Robustness:** Does the solution handle edge cases, invalid data, and potential malicious behavior gracefully?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Explanation:** A brief explanation of your approach, including how it addresses the constraints and handles potential issues, will be helpful. Write it as comments in the code.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and potential edge cases.  Good luck!

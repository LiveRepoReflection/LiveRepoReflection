Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem:

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing the routing algorithm for a large-scale, dynamic network. The network consists of `N` nodes, each uniquely identified by an integer from `0` to `N-1`.  The network topology changes frequently due to node failures, link additions, and link removals.

The network connections are represented by a stream of events. Each event is one of the following types:

*   **`AddLink(node1, node2, latency)`**:  Adds a bidirectional link between `node1` and `node2` with the specified `latency` (a positive integer).  If the link already exists, the latency is updated to the new value.
*   **`RemoveLink(node1, node2)`**: Removes the link between `node1` and `node2`. If the link doesn't exist, the operation has no effect.
*   **`NodeFailure(node)`**: Simulates a failure of `node`. All links connected to this node are immediately removed. The node itself is considered unreachable for routing purposes. If the node is already failed or doesn't exist, the operation has no effect.
*   **`RouteRequest(source, destination)`**:  A request to find the lowest latency path between `source` and `destination`. If a path exists, return the total latency of the optimal path. If no path exists (due to node failures or network disconnection), return `-1`.  Note that `RouteRequest` queries must return as quickly as possible.

Your task is to implement a system that efficiently processes this stream of events and answers the `RouteRequest` queries accurately.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100,000` (Number of nodes)
*   `1 <= latency <= 100`
*   The number of events in the stream can be up to `1,000,000`.
*   Node IDs are always valid (between 0 and N-1 inclusive).
*   The `RouteRequest` queries need to be answered with low latency (sub-second).  Consider the trade-offs between pre-computation and on-demand calculation.
*   The solution should be memory-efficient, avoiding excessive memory consumption as the network grows.
*   The order of events matters.  The system must correctly reflect the network state after each event.
*   The network may become disconnected due to node failures or link removals.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the time complexity of `RouteRequest`.  A naive approach (e.g., running Dijkstra's algorithm from scratch for each request) will likely be too slow.
*   Minimize the overhead of `AddLink`, `RemoveLink`, and `NodeFailure` operations while still ensuring accurate routing information.  Consider how frequently these operations might occur relative to `RouteRequest` queries.

**Real-World Considerations:**

This problem models a simplified version of real-world network routing, where network topology changes dynamically, and efficient route calculation is crucial for performance.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Consider the data structures used to represent the network topology.
*   Think about whether to pre-compute some routing information or calculate routes on demand.
*   Consider how to handle node failures and link changes efficiently.
*   Think about concurrency. If you were to extend this system, how would you handle concurrent requests and updates? (You don't need to implement concurrency, but consider its implications on your design).

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

The solution should aim for an algorithmic complexity that allows it to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds) on a standard machine.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

There are multiple valid approaches to solving this problem, each with different trade-offs between time complexity, memory usage, and implementation complexity. Some potential approaches include:

*   **Dijkstra's Algorithm with Caching:**  Run Dijkstra's algorithm on-demand for each `RouteRequest`, but cache the results to speed up subsequent requests for the same source and destination.  Consider how to invalidate the cache when the network topology changes.
*   **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm with Incremental Updates:**  Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to pre-compute all-pairs shortest paths.  Implement efficient incremental updates to the distance matrix when the network topology changes.
*   **Pathfinding with Heuristics (A\*):** Implement a faster route request with A\* algorithm

The challenge lies in finding the right balance between these factors to achieve optimal performance.

Good luck!  Let me know if you need any clarifications (but I won't give away the solution!).

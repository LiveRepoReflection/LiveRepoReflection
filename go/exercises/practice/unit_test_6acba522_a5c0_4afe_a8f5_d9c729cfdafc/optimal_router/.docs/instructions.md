Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a competitive programming setting, aiming for LeetCode "Hard" difficulty.

**Project Name:** `OptimalRouter`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a large-scale data center network. The data center consists of `N` servers (numbered 0 to N-1) connected by a network of `M` bidirectional links. Each link connects two servers and has an associated latency (expressed as a non-negative integer) representing the time it takes for data to travel across the link. There can be multiple links between two servers, each with potentially different latencies.

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of servers in the data center.
*   `M`: The number of links in the data center.
*   `links`: A slice of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, latency)` represents a bidirectional link between server `u` and server `v` with the given `latency`.  `0 <= u, v < N` and `0 <= latency <= 1000`.
*   `queries`: A slice of tuples, where each tuple `(start, end, deadline)` represents a routing query.  `0 <= start, end < N` and `0 <= deadline <= 10^9`.

For each query `(start, end, deadline)`, your task is to determine the **maximum possible bandwidth** that can be allocated to the route from `start` to `end` while still meeting the `deadline`.

**Bandwidth:** The bandwidth of a route is defined as the **minimum capacity** of any link along that route. You can assume that each link has a capacity between `1` and `1000000` (inclusive), and initially, the available bandwidth of each link is equal to its capacity.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Deadline Adherence:** The total latency of the chosen route must be less than or equal to the `deadline`.
2.  **Maximizing Bandwidth:** You must find a route that maximizes the bandwidth allocated to it, subject to the deadline constraint.
3.  **No Route Possible:** If no route exists between `start` and `end` that meets the `deadline`, return `0`.
4.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle a large number of servers, links, and queries.

**Input:**

*   `N` (int): The number of servers.
*   `M` (int): The number of links.
*   `links` (\[]\[]int): A 2D slice representing the links, where each inner slice is `[u, v, latency]`.
*   `queries` (\[]\[]int): A 2D slice representing the queries, where each inner slice is `[start, end, deadline]`.

**Output:**

*   `results` (\[]int): A slice of integers, where `results[i]` is the maximum possible bandwidth for the `i`-th query.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
M = 5
links = [][]int{{0, 1, 10}, {0, 2, 15}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 20}, {2, 3, 10}}
queries = [][]int{{0, 3, 40}, {0, 3, 35}}

// Expected Output: [1000000, 1000000]

N = 3
M = 3
links = [][]int{{0, 1, 5}, {1, 2, 5}, {0, 2, 15}}
queries = [][]int{{0, 2, 14}}

// Expected Output: [1000000]

N = 3
M = 3
links = [][]int{{0, 1, 5}, {1, 2, 5}, {0, 2, 15}}
queries = [][]int{{0, 2, 9}}

// Expected Output: [0]
```

**Considerations:**

*   The graph can be dense or sparse.
*   There can be multiple paths between any two servers.
*   You'll need to think about how to efficiently find paths that meet the deadline and maximize bandwidth.

Good luck! This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms and optimization techniques.

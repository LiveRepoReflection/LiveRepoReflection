Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills.

## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter with Dynamic Throttling

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service in Go. This service needs to handle a high volume of requests from various clients, ensuring that no single client overwhelms the system. The rate limiter should be robust, scalable, and efficient, with dynamic throttling capabilities.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're building a popular API. You want to protect your backend services from being overloaded by malicious users or faulty clients sending too many requests. You need a rate limiter that can:

1.  **Identify Clients:** Uniquely identify each client.  This could be based on IP address, API key, user ID, or a combination thereof. For simplicity, assume clients are identified by a string `clientID`.

2.  **Enforce Rate Limits:** Enforce a configurable rate limit for each client. The rate limit is defined as a maximum number of requests (`maxRequests`) within a specified time window (`windowDuration`).  For example, a client might be limited to 100 requests per minute.

3.  **Distributed Operation:** Operate in a distributed environment. Multiple instances of the rate limiter service should be able to coordinate and share state to provide a consistent view of rate limits across the entire system.

4.  **Dynamic Throttling:**  Implement a mechanism for dynamic throttling.  The service should monitor the overall system load (e.g., CPU usage, latency of downstream services). If the system load exceeds a predefined threshold, the rate limiter should *automatically* reduce the `maxRequests` allowed for *all* clients by a configurable percentage.  When system load returns to normal, the rate limits should gradually return to their original values. The load should be simulated.

5.  **Request Handling:**

    *   Upon receiving a request from a client, the rate limiter should check if the client has exceeded its rate limit.
    *   If the client is within its limit, the request should be allowed (return `true`).
    *   If the client has exceeded its limit, the request should be rejected (return `false`).
    *   The rate limiter should atomically update the client's request count and timestamp.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests efficiently.
2.  **Scalability:** The design should be scalable to handle a large number of clients and a high request rate. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize contention.
3.  **Persistence:** The rate limiter's state (client request counts and timestamps) should be persisted in a durable store. For simplicity, you can use an in-memory store (e.g., a `sync.Map`) in your solution, but clearly indicate how you would adapt your design to use a distributed cache like Redis for production deployments.
4.  **Efficiency:** Minimize the latency of rate limiting decisions.  The rate limiter should not become a bottleneck in the system.
5.  **Configuration:** Rate limits (`maxRequests`, `windowDuration`), throttling thresholds, and throttling percentages should be configurable.
6.  **Fault Tolerance:**  Consider potential failure scenarios (e.g., network partitions, instance crashes) and design the rate limiter to be resilient to these failures.  This is more of a design consideration; you don't need to implement full fault tolerance, but you should explain your approach.
7.  **Metrics:** Expose metrics (e.g., requests allowed, requests rejected, current rate limits, system load) that can be used to monitor the performance of the rate limiter.

**Constraints:**

*   **Language:** Go
*   **No external rate limiting libraries allowed.** You must implement the core rate limiting logic yourself.  You can use standard library packages (e.g., `time`, `sync`, `context`) and common utility libraries (e.g., logging, metrics).
*   **Keep dependencies to a minimum.** Avoid introducing unnecessary external dependencies.
*   **Optimized for read performance**

**Input:**

*   `clientID` (string): A unique identifier for the client making the request.
*   Simulated system load (percentage)

**Output:**

*   `bool`: `true` if the request is allowed, `false` if the request is rejected.

**Considerations for a Production Environment (Not Required for Solution, but important for Evaluation):**

*   **Redis Integration:** How would you integrate your rate limiter with Redis for distributed caching and persistence?  What data structures would you use in Redis?
*   **Consistent Hashing:** How would you ensure that requests from the same client are consistently routed to the same rate limiter instance to maintain accurate rate limiting?
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** How would you monitor the performance of the rate limiter and set up alerts for potential issues (e.g., high rejection rates, system overload)?

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, distributed systems, and algorithm design. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard difficulty, focusing on graph traversal, optimization, and real-world application.

## Project Name

`OptimalPathways`

## Question Description

Imagine you are designing a smart city transportation system.  The city is represented as a directed graph where each node represents a location and each edge represents a one-way street connecting two locations.  Each street has a traffic congestion score, represented by a positive integer. The higher the score, the more congested the street.

You are given the following inputs:

*   `n`: The number of locations in the city, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `edges`: A list of directed edges represented as `[][]int`, where each inner slice `[u, v, w]` represents a directed edge from location `u` to location `v` with a traffic congestion score of `w`.
*   `start`: The starting location.
*   `destinations`: A list of destination locations `[]int`.

The goal is to find the set of optimal pathways from the `start` location to all locations in the `destinations` list.  An optimal pathway is defined as the path with the *minimum maximum congestion score* among all edges on the path.  In other words, you want to minimize the "worst" traffic you encounter on your journey.

**Requirements:**

1.  For each destination in the `destinations` list, return the minimum maximum congestion score required to reach that destination from the `start` location. If a destination is unreachable from the `start`, return `-1` for that destination.
2.  Your solution must be efficient. The city can be quite large (up to 10^5 locations and edges), and a naive approach will likely result in a timeout.
3.  Handle edge cases gracefully. For example, what happens if the `start` location is not connected to any other locations? What if the `destinations` list is empty? What if the graph contains cycles?
4.  The graph can contain multiple edges between two nodes.
5.  Self-loops are allowed in the graph (an edge from a node to itself).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= u, v < n` (where `[u,v,w]` is an element in `edges`)
*   `1 <= w <= 10^9` (where `[u,v,w]` is an element in `edges`)
*   `0 <= start < n`
*   `0 <= len(destinations) <= n`
*   `0 <= destinations[i] < n` for all valid `i`

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [][]int{{0, 1, 5}, {0, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 6}, {2, 3, 2}, {3, 4, 4}}
start = 0
destinations = []int{3, 4}

Expected Output: []int{3, 4}

Explanation:
- To reach destination 3 from start 0, the optimal path is 0 -> 2 -> 3 with a minimum maximum congestion score of 3 (max(3, 2) = 3).
- To reach destination 4 from start 0, the optimal path is 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 with a minimum maximum congestion score of 4 (max(3, 2, 4) = 4).

```

```
n = 3
edges = [][]int{{0, 1, 10}, {1, 2, 5}, {0, 2, 15}}
start = 0
destinations = []int{2}

Expected Output: []int{10}

Explanation:
- To reach destination 2 from start 0, there are two possible paths:
  - 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a minimum maximum congestion score of 10 (max(10, 5) = 10).
  - 0 -> 2 with a minimum maximum congestion score of 15.
The optimal path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a minimum maximum congestion score of 10.

```

This problem encourages the use of graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or Binary Search in conjunction with graph traversal. The key is to optimize for the specific metric of minimizing the *maximum* edge weight rather than the sum of edge weights. The constraints require careful consideration of time and space complexity.

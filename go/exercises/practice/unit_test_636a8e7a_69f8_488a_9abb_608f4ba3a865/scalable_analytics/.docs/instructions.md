Okay, here's a challenging and sophisticated coding problem for a programming competition, designed to be as difficult as a LeetCode Hard problem and suitable for Go.

### Project Name

`ScalableAnalyticsPlatform`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a scalable analytics platform for processing a large stream of time-series data. The data represents events occurring on a distributed system, and each event has the following structure:

```
{
    "timestamp": int64, // Unix timestamp in nanoseconds
    "node_id": string,  // Unique identifier for the node generating the event
    "metric": string,   // Name of the metric being measured (e.g., "cpu_usage", "memory_usage")
    "value": float64      // Value of the metric
}
```

The platform needs to support the following types of analytical queries:

1.  **Time-Windowed Aggregations:** Calculate aggregate statistics (average, sum, min, max, standard deviation) for a specific metric across a specified time window.  The time window is defined by a start timestamp and an end timestamp. The aggregation should be calculated separately for each `node_id`.

    *   Example: "Calculate the average `cpu_usage` for each node between timestamp T1 and T2."

2.  **Top-K Anomalies:** Identify the `K` nodes with the highest anomaly scores for a given metric within a specified time window. Anomaly score is defined as the absolute difference between the node's metric value and the *median* of all node's metric values at that timestamp, averaged over the time window.

    *   Example: "Find the top 5 nodes with the highest `memory_usage` anomaly scores between timestamp T3 and T4."

3.  **Event Correlation:** Detect correlations between two different metrics originating from the *same* `node_id` within a specified time window. Correlation is measured using Pearson's correlation coefficient.

    *   Example: "Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between `cpu_usage` and `disk_io` for each node between timestamp T5 and T6."

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Scalability:** The platform must be able to handle a high volume of incoming events (millions per second) and efficiently process analytical queries on large datasets.
*   **Real-time Processing:** The platform should provide query results with minimal latency (ideally, within seconds).
*   **Data Storage:** You can assume access to a distributed key-value store (e.g., Cassandra, BadgerDB, RocksDB) to persist the incoming event data. Choose the most appropriate data store for this task and justify your choice in your submission.  Consider both read and write performance requirements.
*   **Concurrency:** The platform must handle concurrent queries from multiple users.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** The platform should minimize memory consumption, especially when dealing with large time windows and numerous nodes.
*   **Accuracy:** Anomaly detection and correlation calculations must be accurate, even with potential data inconsistencies or missing values. You will need to handle these scenarios gracefully.
*   **Time Complexity:** Strive for optimal time complexity for each query type. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize processing time.  Brute-force solutions will likely time out.
*   **Error Handling:** The platform must handle potential errors gracefully, such as invalid query parameters, data access failures, and arithmetic exceptions (e.g., division by zero when calculating standard deviation or correlation).
*   **Node count:** The number of unique `node_id` can be very large (millions).
*   **Timestamp range:** Timestamp differences (T2-T1, T4-T3, T6-T5) can be very large (days, weeks, months), implying a potentially enormous number of data points per node.

**Deliverables:**

1.  **Design Document:** A detailed description of your platform architecture, including:

    *   Component breakdown (e.g., data ingestion, data storage, query processing).
    *   Data structures used for efficient storage and retrieval.
    *   Algorithms used for each query type.
    *   Concurrency management strategy.
    *   Justification for your choice of distributed key-value store.
    *   Error handling strategies.
    *   Analysis of the time and space complexity of each query.
2.  **Go Implementation:** A working Go implementation of the platform, including:

    *   Data ingestion component to receive and store incoming events.
    *   Query processing component to handle the three types of analytical queries.
    *   Clear and well-documented code.
    *   Appropriate use of Go concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, mutexes).

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The platform must accurately process the analytical queries and produce the correct results.
*   Scalability: The platform must be able to handle a high volume of incoming events and efficiently process queries on large datasets.
*   Performance: The platform must provide query results with minimal latency.
*   Code Quality: The code must be well-structured, readable, and well-documented.
*   Design: The platform architecture must be sound and well-justified.
*   Handling of Edge Cases: The platform handles various edge cases and constraints gracefully.

This problem requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems. Good luck!

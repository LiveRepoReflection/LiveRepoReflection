Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Orchestrator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction orchestrator.  Imagine a system where multiple microservices need to participate in a single, atomic transaction. If all services successfully complete their part, the transaction is committed. If any service fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back, ensuring data consistency across all involved services.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Service Definition:**  Assume you have `n` microservices (where `1 <= n <= 100`). Each service is represented by a unique integer ID from `1` to `n`. Each service exposes two fundamental operations: `Prepare(transactionID)` and `Commit(transactionID) / Rollback(transactionID)`.

2.  **Transaction Lifecycle:** A transaction is initiated by the orchestrator, identified by a unique `transactionID` (a UUID string). The orchestrator must:

    *   Send a `Prepare` request to all `n` services concurrently. Each `Prepare` request should include the `transactionID`. A service, upon receiving `Prepare`, simulates processing the transaction and returns a boolean indicating success or failure.  A service can fail `Prepare` due to various reasons (e.g., resource contention, validation errors).
    *   If *all* `Prepare` requests succeed, the orchestrator must send a `Commit` request to all `n` services concurrently, using the same `transactionID`.
    *   If *any* `Prepare` request fails, the orchestrator must send a `Rollback` request to *all* `n` services concurrently, using the same `transactionID`.
    *   `Commit` and `Rollback` requests are guaranteed to succeed if they are called after a successful `Prepare`. However, they must be idempotent (i.e., calling `Commit` or `Rollback` multiple times should have the same effect as calling it once).

3.  **Error Handling:**

    *   Implement proper error handling.  Specifically, deal with network issues/timeouts during `Prepare`, `Commit`, and `Rollback` phases. A failed request should be retried a reasonable number of times (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff).  If a service remains unreachable after retries during `Commit` or `Rollback`, the orchestrator should log the error and proceed with the remaining services. The orchestrator should NOT halt on individual service failures during `Commit` or `Rollback`.
    *   The orchestrator should handle the scenario where some services take significantly longer to respond than others (e.g., simulate varying network latency).

4.  **Concurrency:** The solution must be highly concurrent.  The orchestrator should initiate `Prepare`, `Commit`, and `Rollback` requests to all services in parallel, maximizing throughput. Use goroutines and channels effectively.

5.  **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to track the progress of each transaction, including the success/failure of each `Prepare`, `Commit`, and `Rollback` request.

6.  **Orchestrator API:** Your orchestrator should provide a single public function: `OrchestrateTransaction(transactionID string, serviceEndpoints []string) bool`.  This function takes the `transactionID` and a slice of service endpoint URLs (e.g., `["http://localhost:8081", "http://localhost:8082", ...]`). It returns `true` if the transaction was successfully committed (all `Prepare` requests succeeded), and `false` if it was rolled back (at least one `Prepare` request failed).

7.  **Service Simulation:**  You don't need to implement actual microservices. Instead, provide a *mock* implementation of the `Prepare`, `Commit`, and `Rollback` endpoints. These mock endpoints should simulate varying success/failure rates and latencies. You should be able to configure the probability of failure and the latency for each mock service.

**Constraints:**

*   **Efficiency:** The orchestrator must be reasonably efficient in terms of resource usage (CPU, memory). Avoid unnecessary allocations or blocking operations.
*   **Scalability:**  The design should be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent transactions.
*   **Idempotency:**  The `Commit` and `Rollback` operations on the services must be idempotent.
*   **Real-world Simulation:** The service simulations should realistically mimic scenarios such as network latency, intermittent failures, and service unavailability.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the orchestrator correctly implement the transaction lifecycle (Prepare -> Commit/Rollback)?
*   Error Handling: Does the orchestrator handle errors gracefully and retry failed requests?
*   Concurrency: Is the solution highly concurrent?
*   Efficiency: Is the solution efficient in terms of resource usage?
*   Logging: Is the logging comprehensive and informative?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, error handling, and system design principles in Go. Good luck!

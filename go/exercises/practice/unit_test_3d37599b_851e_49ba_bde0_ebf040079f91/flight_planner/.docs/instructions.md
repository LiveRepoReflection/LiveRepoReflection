Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test a competitor's knowledge of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

**Problem Title: Minimum Cost Flight Planner with Dynamic Pricing**

**Problem Description:**

You are developing a flight planning application to determine the minimum cost route between two cities. The flight network is represented as a directed graph where cities are nodes and flights are edges. Each flight (edge) has a base cost. However, the cost of each flight is *dynamic* and depends on the number of passengers already booked on that flight.

More specifically, for each flight, you are given:

*   `Base Cost (C)`: The initial cost of the flight if no one has booked it.
*   `Capacity (K)`: The maximum number of passengers the flight can accommodate.
*   `Price Increment (I)`: For each passenger booked on the flight, the cost increases by `I`. The cost of the flight for `n` passengers (where `n <= K`) is therefore `C + n * I`.

You are given a series of flight requests. Each request specifies:

*   `Source City (S)`
*   `Destination City (D)`
*   `Number of Passengers (P)`: The number of passengers that need to travel from `S` to `D`.

Your task is to determine the *minimum total cost* to transport all `P` passengers from `S` to `D`. You *must* transport all passengers together along the *same* route. You need to consider the dynamic pricing of the flights based on the number of passengers using each flight.

**Input:**

1.  `N`: The number of cities (numbered from 0 to N-1).
2.  `M`: The number of flights.
3.  A list of `M` flights, where each flight is represented by:
    *   `U`: Source city (0 <= U < N)
    *   `V`: Destination city (0 <= V < N)
    *   `C`: Base cost (0 <= C <= 1000)
    *   `K`: Capacity (1 <= K <= 100)
    *   `I`: Price Increment (0 <= I <= 100)
4.  `Q`: The number of flight requests.
5.  A list of `Q` flight requests, where each request is represented by:
    *   `S`: Source city (0 <= S < N)
    *   `D`: Destination city (0 <= D < N)
    *   `P`: Number of passengers (1 <= P <= 100)

**Output:**

For each flight request, output the minimum total cost to transport all passengers from the source city to the destination city. If no route exists between the source and destination, output -1.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= N <= 50
*   1 <= M <= 200
*   1 <= Q <= 100
*   All input values are integers.
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Multiple flights may exist between the same pair of cities.
*   You need to find the optimal route, considering the dynamic pricing based on passenger count.

**Example:**

```
Input:
N = 4 (Cities: 0, 1, 2, 3)
M = 5 (Flights)
Flights:
0 1 10 20 1   (Source, Destination, Base Cost, Capacity, Increment)
0 2 15 15 2
1 2 5 25 0
1 3 20 10 3
2 3 12 30 1
Q = 2 (Requests)
Requests:
0 3 10 (Source, Destination, Passengers)
0 3 25

Output:
400
-1
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Request 1 (0 -> 3, 10 passengers):** One possible route is 0 -> 1 -> 3. The cost of 0 -> 1 is 10 + (10 \* 1) = 20. The cost of 1 -> 3 is 20 + (10 \* 3) = 50. Total cost = 20 + 50 = 70. Another possible route is 0 -> 2 -> 3. The cost of 0 -> 2 is 15 + (10 \* 2) = 35. The cost of 2 -> 3 is 12 + (10 \* 1) = 22. Total cost = 35 + 22 = 57. After exploring several paths the optimal route is 0->1->2->3, costing 400.
*   **Request 2 (0 -> 3, 25 passengers):**  There is no possible route due to Capacity limits.  The direct route 0 -> 1 ->3 flight 0->1 has capacity 20 so the request of 25 passengers makes it impossible.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on correctness and efficiency. A correct solution should pass all test cases, including edge cases and larger datasets. An efficient solution should minimize the execution time, particularly for larger graphs.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path algorithm.
*   Think about how to efficiently calculate the cost of a flight based on the number of passengers.
*   Be careful about integer overflows.
*   Consider using caching mechanisms to avoid recomputing the same costs multiple times.
*   Be aware of disconnected graphs.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, dynamic programming (potentially for optimization), and careful consideration of edge cases and constraints. It provides ample opportunity for candidates to demonstrate their problem-solving skills and coding proficiency in Go. Good luck!

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a distributed k-clustering algorithm for a massive dataset representing network node embeddings.  The goal is to efficiently group the nodes into `k` clusters, minimizing the distance between nodes within the same cluster and maximizing the distance between nodes in different clusters.

However, the dataset is too large to fit into a single machine's memory. It is distributed across `n` worker nodes.  Each worker node holds a subset of the complete dataset.  The challenge lies in coordinating the clustering process across these distributed nodes while minimizing communication overhead and maintaining accuracy.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Input Data:** Each worker node `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) holds a list of node embeddings. A node embedding is represented as a `struct` containing a unique node ID (integer) and a feature vector (a slice of floats).  The feature vector represents the node's characteristics.
    ```go
    type NodeEmbedding struct {
        NodeID int
        Features []float64
    }
    ```

2.  **Distance Metric:** Use Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between node embeddings.

3.  **K-Means Algorithm:** Adapt the K-Means clustering algorithm to a distributed setting.  A key challenge is how to update the cluster centroids efficiently across all worker nodes.

4.  **Distributed Centroid Update:**  Implement a mechanism for worker nodes to collaboratively calculate the new centroids after each iteration. The master node initializes the centroids and distributes them to the worker nodes. Each worker node calculates the nearest centroid for its local node embeddings, then sends the number of nodes assigned to each centroid and the sum of the feature vectors of those nodes to the master node. The master node aggregates this information and calculates the new centroids, then redistributes them to the worker nodes for the next iteration.

5.  **Convergence:**  The algorithm should converge when the maximum distance any centroid moves between iterations is below a certain threshold (`epsilon`).

6.  **Fault Tolerance:** Ideally, the solution should be somewhat robust to worker node failures. While complete fault tolerance isn't required, consider how your design might handle a worker node becoming unresponsive during the computation. (This is more of a design consideration, not necessarily code to be implemented).

7.  **Communication:** Minimize communication between worker nodes and the master node. Avoid broadcasting the entire dataset or individual embeddings across the network.

**Constraints:**

*   `n` (number of worker nodes): 1 <= n <= 100
*   `k` (number of clusters): 1 <= k <= 10
*   Number of node embeddings per worker node: can vary, but is limited by memory constraints.  Assume that each worker can hold at most `10000` embeddings.
*   Feature vector dimension: 1 <= dimension <= 100
*   `epsilon` (convergence threshold): `1e-6`
*   The node IDs are unique across all the worker nodes.
*   The same node ID can never appear twice on the same worker node.

**Requirements:**

*   Write a function `DistributedKMeans(workerData [][]NodeEmbedding, k int, epsilon float64) [][]int` that takes the worker data (a slice of slices of `NodeEmbedding`), the number of clusters `k`, and the convergence threshold `epsilon` as input. It should return a slice of slices of integers, where each inner slice represents the NodeIDs belonging to a cluster. The outer slice represents the k clusters.
*   The function should handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., empty input data, invalid `k` value).
*   The solution should be optimized for performance, especially in terms of communication overhead.  Avoid unnecessary data transfers.
*   The solution should be deterministic. Given the same input, it should always produce the same output clusters (or equivalent clustering).

**Bonus (Not strictly required for a correct solution, but highly desirable):**

*   Implement a mechanism for initializing centroids more intelligently than random selection (e.g., K-Means++ initialization).
*   Provide a way to measure the quality of the clustering (e.g., Silhouette score).
*   Discuss the trade-offs between accuracy and communication overhead in your design.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed algorithms, K-Means clustering, data structures, and optimization techniques.  It will test a candidate's ability to design and implement a complex system with real-world constraints.

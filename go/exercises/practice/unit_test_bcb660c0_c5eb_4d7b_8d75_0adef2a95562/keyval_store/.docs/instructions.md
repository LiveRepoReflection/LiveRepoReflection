Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level.

## Project Name

`ScalableKeyValStore`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable key-value store in Go. The key-value store should support the following operations:

*   **`Put(key string, value string)`:** Stores the given key-value pair.
*   **`Get(key string)`:** Retrieves the value associated with the given key. Returns an empty string if the key does not exist.
*   **`Delete(key string)`:** Deletes the key-value pair associated with the given key.
*   **`Range(startKey string, endKey string)`:** Retrieves all key-value pairs where the key is lexicographically between `startKey` (inclusive) and `endKey` (exclusive).  Returns a slice of key-value pairs. Keys should be returned in lexicographical order.
*   **`Count(startKey string, endKey string)`:** Returns the number of keys that are lexicographically between `startKey` (inclusive) and `endKey` (exclusive).
*   **`Backup(filepath string)`:** Persists the entire key-value store to a file at the given filepath.
*   **`Restore(filepath string)`:** Restores the key-value store from a file at the given filepath, overwriting any existing data.

**Scalability Requirements:**

The key-value store must be designed to handle a large number of keys and concurrent access from multiple clients. The total number of keys can potentially exceed available memory. The goal is to achieve high throughput and low latency for all operations.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Large Data Volume:** The key-value store should be able to handle a dataset that exceeds the available RAM.  Consider using disk-based storage for persistence and handling larger-than-memory data.
*   **Concurrency:** The key-value store must be thread-safe and handle concurrent `Put`, `Get`, `Delete`, and `Range` requests efficiently.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.
*   **Crash Recovery:**  After a crash, the key-value store should be able to restore its state from the most recent backup file. Data loss should be minimized.
*   **Lexicographical Ordering:** `Range` operations must return results in lexicographical order based on keys.
*   **Efficient Range Queries:** `Range` queries should be efficient even when the range spans a large portion of the key space. Avoid full table scans.
*   **String Size Limits:** Both keys and values can be arbitrarily long strings.
*   **Empty Key/Value:** Empty keys and empty values are valid.
*   **Invalid Filepath:** The `Backup` and `Restore` operations should handle invalid filepaths gracefully (e.g., file not found, permission denied). Return appropriate errors.
*   **Backup/Restore Concurrency:**  Ensure Backup/Restore operations do not interfere with other operations (Get, Put, Delete, Range, Count) running concurrently.
*   **Atomic Operations:** `Put`, `Delete`, and `Restore` should be atomic. Either the entire operation completes successfully, or the store remains in its previous consistent state.

**Performance Requirements:**

*   **High Throughput:** The key-value store should be able to handle a large number of requests per second.
*   **Low Latency:**  The latency for `Get`, `Put`, and `Delete` operations should be minimized.
*   **Efficient Range Queries:** `Range` queries should have a reasonable response time even for large ranges.

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. Consider using a sorted data structure for efficient range queries and disk-based storage. (e.g., B-Tree, LSM Tree, Sorted String Table (SSTable)).
*   **Concurrency Control:** Implement appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety while minimizing contention.  Consider using read/write locks for improved concurrency.
*   **Persistence:** Implement a robust persistence mechanism to ensure data durability.  Consider using techniques like write-ahead logging (WAL) or snapshots for crash recovery.
*   **Optimization:**  Optimize the code for performance by minimizing memory allocations, reducing lock contention, and using efficient algorithms.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and logging.

This problem tests the ability to design a scalable, concurrent, and persistent key-value store, considering various trade-offs between performance, consistency, and resource usage. Good luck!

Okay, here's a coding problem designed to be challenging, sophisticated, and suitable for a high-level programming competition.

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient route optimization system for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes (numbered 0 to N-1) and `M` bidirectional communication links. Each link connects two nodes and has an associated latency representing the time it takes for a signal to travel between the nodes.

The network is dynamic: links can fail and recover at any time. You are given a series of `Q` queries representing these events and route requests.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network. (1 <= N <= 1000)
*   `M`: The initial number of communication links. (0 <= M <= N\*(N-1)/2)
*   `links`: A list of `M` tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, latency)` represents a bidirectional link between node `u` and node `v` with the given `latency` (1 <= latency <= 100).  It is guaranteed that there is at most one link between any two nodes.
*   `Q`: The number of queries. (1 <= Q <= 100000)
*   `queries`: A list of `Q` queries. Each query is one of the following types:
    *   **"add u v latency"**: Adds a new bidirectional link between node `u` and node `v` with the given `latency`. If a link already exists between these nodes, the query should be ignored.
    *   **"remove u v"**: Removes the link between node `u` and node `v`. If no such link exists, the query should be ignored.
    *   **"route source destination"**: Finds the shortest path (minimum total latency) between node `source` and node `destination`. If no path exists, return -1.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   All node indices (`u`, `v`, `source`, `destination`) are within the range [0, N-1].
*   The network might not be fully connected.
*   The same query ("add", "remove", or "route") can appear multiple times with different parameters.
*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries (`Q = 100000`) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).
*   The shortest path should be calculated using the *current* network topology, reflecting all previous "add" and "remove" operations.
*   You should aim for the best possible time complexity for each type of query. Consider using appropriate data structures to optimize link management and pathfinding.
*   Memory usage should also be considered, avoid unnecessary data duplication.

**Output:**

For each "route" query, output the shortest path latency between the source and destination nodes.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
M = 2
links = [(0, 1, 5), (1, 2, 3)]
Q = 4
queries = [
    "route 0 2",
    "add 2 3 2",
    "route 0 3",
    "remove 1 2"
]
```

**Expected Output:**

```
8
10
-1
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Initially, the network has links (0,1,5) and (1,2,3). The shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0 -> 1 -> 2 with latency 5 + 3 = 8.
2.  The link (2,3,2) is added.
3.  Now, the network has links (0,1,5), (1,2,3), and (2,3,2). The shortest path from 0 to 3 is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 with latency 5 + 3 + 2 = 10.
4.  The link (1,2) is removed.
5.  Now, the network has links (0,1,5) and (2,3,2). There is no path from 0 to 3, so the output is -1.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path finding), efficient data structure usage (for link management), and careful consideration of time complexity to handle a large number of queries effectively. Good luck!

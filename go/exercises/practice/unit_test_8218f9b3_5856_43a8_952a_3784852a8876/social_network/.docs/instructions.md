Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging, sophisticated, and suitable for a high-level programming competition, with a focus on algorithmic efficiency and practical application.

## Project Name

`ScalableSocialNetwork`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing core functionalities for a scalable social network.  The network represents users and their connections (friendships). The challenge lies in efficiently handling a massive number of users and connections, along with complex relationship queries.

Specifically, you need to implement a system that supports the following operations:

1.  **`AddUser(userID int)`:** Adds a new user to the network. User IDs are integers. If a user with the same ID already exists, the operation should be ignored without error.

2.  **`RemoveUser(userID int)`:** Removes a user from the network. If the user does not exist, the operation should be ignored without error. Removing a user should also remove all connections (friendships) associated with that user.

3.  **`Connect(userID1 int, userID2 int)`:** Creates a friendship (undirected edge) between two users. If either user does not exist, the operation should be ignored without error. If the users are already connected, the operation should be ignored without error. Connections are bidirectional.

4.  **`Disconnect(userID1 int, userID2 int)`:** Removes the friendship between two users. If either user does not exist, or if the users are not connected, the operation should be ignored without error.

5.  **`GetFriends(userID int) []int`:** Returns a sorted list of friend IDs for a given user. If the user does not exist, return an empty list.  The friend IDs must be sorted in ascending order.

6.  **`GetMutualFriends(userID1 int, userID2 int) []int`:** Returns a sorted list of mutual friend IDs between two users. If either user does not exist, or if they are not friends, return an empty list. The mutual friend IDs must be sorted in ascending order.

7.  **`GetShortestFriendshipPath(userID1 int, userID2 int) []int`:** Finds the shortest path (sequence of user IDs representing friendships) between two users. If either user does not exist, return an empty list. If no path exists, return an empty list. The returned list should start with `userID1` and end with `userID2`. If `userID1` and `userID2` are the same, return a list containing only `userID1`. If they are directly connected return a list of `[userID1, userID2]`.

**Constraints:**

*   The system must be highly efficient in terms of both time and memory.  Consider the implications of each operation on the overall performance, especially for large networks.
*   User IDs are non-negative integers.
*   The number of users and connections can be extremely large (millions or billions).
*   The solution must be thread-safe (concurrent access to the data structure). Multiple goroutines might access the social network concurrently. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent data races and ensure data consistency.
*   The `GetShortestFriendshipPath` function needs to be optimized to provide the shortest distance between the given two users. A naive approach can lead to timeout issues.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly implement all the specified functionalities.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be efficient in terms of both time and memory, especially for large datasets.  Consider the algorithmic complexity of each operation.
*   Scalability: The solution must be able to handle a large number of users and connections.
*   Concurrency: The solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent access correctly.
*   Code Quality: The code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem challenges the solver to think about data structure choices (e.g., adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, hash maps), graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search for shortest path), and concurrency patterns in Go.  The emphasis on scalability and efficiency elevates the difficulty significantly.  Different approaches will have different trade-offs between memory usage and performance, requiring careful consideration.

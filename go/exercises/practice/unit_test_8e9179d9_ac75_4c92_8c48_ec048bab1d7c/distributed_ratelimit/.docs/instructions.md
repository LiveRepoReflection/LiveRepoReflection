Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level.

## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter with Consistent Hashing

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter for a large-scale online service.  The service receives a high volume of requests from various clients, and it's crucial to protect backend resources from being overwhelmed by malicious or faulty clients.

The rate limiter must meet the following requirements:

1.  **Distributed:** The rate limiter should be able to run across multiple nodes to handle the high request volume.

2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limit should be configurable per client (identified by a unique client ID) and should be expressed as a maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute for client A, 500 requests per hour for client B).  Multiple rate limits can apply to a single client, and the strictest limit must be enforced.

3.  **Consistent Hashing:**  Requests from the same client should ideally be routed to the same rate limiter node to minimize the need for cross-node synchronization. Implement consistent hashing to distribute clients across the nodes.

4.  **Thread-Safe:**  The rate limiter must be thread-safe to handle concurrent requests.

5.  **Atomic Operations:** Use atomic operations to ensure the accuracy of the rate limiting decisions even under heavy load.

6.  **Optimized Performance:** The rate limiter should be highly performant to minimize latency for legitimate requests. Avoid unnecessary locking or data copies.

7.  **Eviction Policy:** Implement an eviction policy to remove inactive clients from memory after a certain period of inactivity to prevent unbounded memory growth.

8.  **Time Synchronization:** Assume that all rate limiter nodes have reasonably synchronized clocks (e.g., using NTP).

9.  **Graceful Degradation:** The system should degrade gracefully. If a rate limiter node fails, the consistent hashing should ensure that requests are rerouted to other nodes, and the service remains available (albeit potentially with slightly reduced accuracy in rate limiting during the transition period).

10. **Scalability:** Design your data structures and algorithms with scalability in mind. Consider how your solution would handle millions of clients and thousands of requests per second.

### Input

You need to implement the following function:

```go
// Should return true if the request is allowed, false otherwise.
func AllowRequest(clientID string, rateLimits []RateLimit, requestTime time.Time) bool
```

Where:

*   `clientID` is a string representing the unique identifier of the client making the request.
*   `rateLimits` is a slice of `RateLimit` structs defining the rate limits for the client.
*   `requestTime` is the time of the request.
```go
type RateLimit struct {
	Requests  int
	Window    time.Duration
}
```

### Constraints

*   The number of rate limiter nodes is assumed to be fixed and known at startup.
*   You are responsible for initializing and managing the rate limiter nodes.
*   You can use any standard Go libraries (e.g., `sync`, `time`, `atomic`).
*   Minimize external dependencies.
*   Focus on the core rate limiting logic and consistent hashing. You don't need to implement a full-fledged distributed system with RPC calls and node discovery. You can simulate this in your test suite.
*   Assume clientIDs are non-empty strings.
*   RateLimits will always have positive `Requests` value and `Window` duration.

### Expected Output

The `AllowRequest` function should return `true` if the request is allowed according to all applicable rate limits, and `false` otherwise.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following:

*   **Correctness:** Does the rate limiter accurately enforce the configured rate limits?
*   **Concurrency:** Is the rate limiter thread-safe?
*   **Performance:** Is the rate limiter performant under high load?
*   **Scalability:** Is the design scalable to handle a large number of clients and requests?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Consistent Hashing:** Is consistent hashing implemented correctly?
*   **Eviction Policy:** Is eviction implemented and effective?

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems concepts. Good luck!

## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Weighted Fair Queuing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service that incorporates Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ). This service will be used to protect a critical API from being overwhelmed by requests from various clients, while also ensuring that clients with higher priority are given preferential treatment.

The service needs to handle a large number of concurrent requests across multiple distributed instances. It must be highly available, fault-tolerant, and efficient in terms of resource consumption.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Rate Limiting:** The service must enforce a global rate limit for each client, identified by a unique client ID.  The rate limit is defined as *N* requests per *T* seconds.

2.  **Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ):** Clients are assigned a weight. The service should allocate bandwidth fairly among clients based on their assigned weights. A client with a higher weight should receive a proportionally larger share of the available rate limit.  For example, if two clients have weights 2 and 1 respectively, the client with weight 2 should be allowed to send approximately twice as many requests within a given time window.

3.  **Distributed Architecture:**  The rate limiter service will be deployed across *M* instances. The implementation must ensure that the rate limiting and WFQ are enforced consistently across all instances.  Assume a shared, consistent data store (e.g., Redis, etcd) is available for inter-instance communication and state management.

4.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The rate limits and weights for clients can be updated dynamically at runtime. The service must be able to handle these updates without significant performance impact or downtime. The update frequency can be very high.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to failures of individual instances. If an instance fails, the other instances should continue to operate correctly and maintain consistent rate limiting and WFQ.

6.  **Efficiency:** The implementation must be highly efficient in terms of memory usage, CPU utilization, and network bandwidth.  Consider the impact of data serialization/deserialization, network latency, and contention on shared resources.

7.  **Edge Cases:**

    *   **Zero Weight:** Handle clients with a weight of zero gracefully.  They should still be subject to a minimal rate limit to prevent starvation.
    *   **Weight Updates during Requests:**  Ensure that weight updates are handled atomically and do not lead to inconsistencies in WFQ.
    *   **Clock Skew:** Account for potential clock skew between different instances.
    *   **High Concurrency:**  The service must be able to handle a very high volume of concurrent requests.

8.  **API:** The service should expose the following API:

    *   `Allow(clientID string) bool`:  Checks if a request from the given client ID is allowed based on the rate limit and WFQ.  Returns `true` if the request is allowed, `false` otherwise.
    *   `UpdateClientWeight(clientID string, weight int)`:  Updates the weight for the given client ID.
    *   `UpdateClientRateLimit(clientID string, rate int, duration time.Duration)`: Updates the rate limit (requests per duration) for the given client ID.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The implementation must accurately enforce rate limits and WFQ.
*   **Performance:** The service must handle a high volume of requests with low latency and minimal resource consumption.
*   **Scalability:** The design must be scalable to handle a large number of clients and instances.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The service must be resilient to failures of individual instances.
*   **Code Quality:** The code must be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   **Concurrency Handling:** The implementation should properly handle concurrent access to shared resources, preventing race conditions and data corruption.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be implemented in Go.
*   Use of external libraries is permitted, but justify the use of each library and consider its impact on performance and dependencies.
*   Assume that client IDs are strings.
*   Weights are integers.
*   Minimize the use of global locks as they can severely impact performance at scale.
*   The solution should be as close to real-time as possible.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, rate limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket), weighted fair queuing, concurrency, and Go programming. It's a challenging problem that should differentiate between experienced and novice programmers. Good luck!

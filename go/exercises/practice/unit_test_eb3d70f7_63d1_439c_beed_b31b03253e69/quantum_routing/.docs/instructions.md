## The Quantum Network Routing Problem

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a nascent quantum network. This network consists of `N` quantum nodes, each capable of performing complex quantum computations and transmitting qubits to other nodes.  The network's architecture is defined by a weighted, undirected graph where nodes represent quantum computers and edges represent quantum communication channels. Each edge has an associated *fidelity* value, representing the probability of successfully transmitting a qubit across that channel without decoherence.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given a source node `S`, a destination node `D`, and the network graph, finds the **most reliable** path for transmitting quantum information from `S` to `D`. Reliability is defined as the *product* of the fidelities of the edges along the path.  Since multiplying many small probabilities can lead to floating-point precision issues, the challenge is to maximize the *logarithm* of the reliability (which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the logarithms of the fidelities).

**Input:**

*   `N`: An integer representing the number of quantum nodes (numbered from 0 to N-1).
*   `graph`: A representation of the quantum network as a slice of slices of `Edge` structs. `graph[i]` represents the edges connected to node `i`.
*   `Edge`: A struct defined as:

    ```go
    type Edge struct {
        To     int     // The destination node of the edge
        Fidelity float64 // The fidelity of the quantum channel (0 < Fidelity <= 1)
    }
    ```

*   `S`: An integer representing the source node.
*   `D`: An integer representing the destination node.

**Output:**

A slice of integers representing the nodes in the most reliable path from `S` to `D` (inclusive of `S` and `D`). If no path exists, return an empty slice.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= S < N`
*   `0 <= D < N`
*   `0 < Fidelity <= 1` for all edges.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Multiple paths may have the same maximum reliability. In such cases, return any one of them.
*   The solution must have a time complexity better than O(N!) in the worst case. (Brute force solutions will not pass.)

**Example:**

```go
N := 4
graph := [][]Edge{
    { {To: 1, Fidelity: 0.9}, {To: 2, Fidelity: 0.8} }, // Node 0
    { {To: 0, Fidelity: 0.9}, {To: 3, Fidelity: 0.7} }, // Node 1
    { {To: 0, Fidelity: 0.8}, {To: 3, Fidelity: 0.6} }, // Node 2
    { {To: 1, Fidelity: 0.7}, {To: 2, Fidelity: 0.6} }, // Node 3
}
S := 0
D := 3

// Expected output (one possible optimal path): [0, 1, 3] (reliability: 0.9 * 0.7 = 0.63, log reliability is approximately -0.462)
// Another possible optimal path: [0, 2, 3] (reliability: 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48, log reliability is approximately -0.734)
```

**Considerations:**

*   Think carefully about how to handle the log-transformation of the fidelities to avoid precision issues and potential underflows.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures to efficiently track the best paths found so far.
*   Be mindful of potential cycles in the graph and avoid infinite loops.
*   Think about potential edge cases, such as when the source and destination nodes are the same, or when no path exists between them.
*   Optimization of the algorithm can have a massive impact on the execution time.

This problem combines graph algorithms, numerical stability considerations, and potentially some design patterns to ensure an efficient and robust solution. Good luck!

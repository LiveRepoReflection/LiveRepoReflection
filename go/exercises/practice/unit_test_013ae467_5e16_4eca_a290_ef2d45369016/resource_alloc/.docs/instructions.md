Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at LeetCode Hard level.

**Project Name:** `OptimalResourceAllocation`

**Question Description:**

Imagine a distributed system with `N` microservices. Each microservice requires a specific amount of several resource types (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network Bandwidth). You are given a cluster of `M` machines, each with its own capacity for each resource type.

The goal is to find an **optimal** allocation of microservices to machines such that:

1.  **Feasibility:** All microservices are assigned to exactly one machine.
2.  **Capacity Constraints:** The total resource requirements of microservices assigned to a machine must not exceed the machine's capacity for any resource type.
3.  **Cost Minimization:** The total cost of the allocation is minimized.  The cost of assigning a microservice to a machine is given by a cost matrix `C` where `C[i][j]` is the cost of assigning microservice `i` to machine `j`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: Number of microservices (1 <= N <= 16)
*   `M`: Number of machines (1 <= M <= 16)
*   `serviceRequirements`: A `[][]int` representing the resource requirements of each microservice.  `serviceRequirements[i][k]` is the amount of resource `k` required by microservice `i`. Assume there are `K` resource types (1 <= K <= 4).
*   `machineCapacities`: A `[][]int` representing the resource capacities of each machine. `machineCapacities[j][k]` is the capacity of machine `j` for resource `k`.
*   `costMatrix`: A `[][]int` representing the cost of assigning microservice `i` to machine `j`. `costMatrix[i][j]` is the cost.
*   `instanceCount`: A `[]int` representing the instance count of each microservice. `instanceCount[i]` is the number of instances for the microservice `i`.

**Output:**

*   An `int` representing the minimum total cost of a feasible allocation. If no feasible allocation exists, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **NP-Hardness:** The problem is NP-hard, so an exhaustive search is not feasible for larger values of N and M.  Efficient algorithms and data structures are necessary.
*   **Optimization:** Focus on finding the *optimal* allocation, not just a feasible one.
*   **Multiple Resource Types:** The feasibility constraint involves multiple resource types, making it more complex than a simple bin-packing problem.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no feasible allocation exists (return -1). Handle cases where N > M. Handle potential integer overflows carefully.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** The solution must be reasonably efficient given the input constraints (N <= 16, M <= 16). Branch and Bound, Dynamic Programming with bitmasking, or other optimization techniques will likely be needed.
*   **Instance Count**: The microservices are allowed to have multiple instances. All instances of the microservice should be allocated in the same machine.

This problem requires a solid understanding of algorithmic techniques, optimization strategies, and efficient coding practices in Go. Good luck!

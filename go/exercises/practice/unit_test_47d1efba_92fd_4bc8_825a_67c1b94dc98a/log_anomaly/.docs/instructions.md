Okay, here's a challenging Go programming problem description, designed to be similar to a LeetCode hard problem.

**Problem Title: Distributed Log Aggregation and Anomaly Detection**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed system for log aggregation and anomaly detection.  Imagine a large-scale microservices architecture where numerous services generate continuous streams of log data. Your system must collect these logs, store them efficiently, and detect anomalous patterns in real-time.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Log Ingestion:** Implement a scalable log ingestion component.  Services will send log entries to your system using a gRPC-based interface. Each log entry consists of:
    *   `timestamp` (Unix timestamp in nanoseconds, int64)
    *   `service_name` (string, e.g., "order-service", "payment-service")
    *   `log_level` (enum: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`)
    *   `message` (string, the actual log message)

    Your system should be able to handle a sustained load of **1 million log entries per second**.  Log entries may arrive out-of-order due to network latency.

2.  **Distributed Storage:** Design and implement a distributed storage solution for the ingested logs.  You cannot use a centralized database.  Consider using a consistent hashing scheme to distribute log data across multiple storage nodes. Each storage node has limited memory (e.g., 10GB).  Implement data sharding and replication for fault tolerance and performance.  Logs must be retrievable by `service_name` and `timestamp range` within a reasonable time (e.g., 99th percentile latency < 100ms).

3.  **Anomaly Detection:** Implement a real-time anomaly detection algorithm. For each `service_name`, maintain a sliding window of the last `N` (e.g., 1000) log entries.  Implement a simple anomaly detection mechanism: count the number of `ERROR` level log entries within the sliding window. If the number of `ERROR` logs exceeds a threshold `T` (e.g., 10), flag the `service_name` as potentially anomalous.  The anomaly detection should be performed in a distributed and parallel manner to minimize latency.

4.  **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:**  The system must be scalable and fault-tolerant. You should be able to easily add or remove storage nodes without significant downtime or data loss.  Implement mechanisms to handle node failures and ensure data consistency.

5.  **Optimization:** Optimize your solution for both throughput (log ingestion rate) and latency (query response time, anomaly detection time). Consider techniques such as caching, indexing, and parallel processing.

**Constraints:**

*   Implement your solution in Go.
*   You are allowed to use external libraries/frameworks (e.g., gRPC, consistent hashing libraries, data serialization libraries), but you must justify your choices.
*   The system should be deployable as a set of Docker containers.
*   Memory usage per node should be minimized.
*   Data consistency is crucial. You cannot afford to lose log entries.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the system correctly ingest, store, and retrieve log data?  Does the anomaly detection algorithm accurately identify anomalous services?
*   Performance:  What is the maximum log ingestion rate the system can handle?  What is the average query response time for retrieving logs? What is the latency of the anomaly detection?
*   Scalability:  How easily can the system be scaled to handle increasing data volumes?
*   Fault Tolerance:  How well does the system handle node failures?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?  Does it follow Go best practices?
*   Design: Is the overall system architecture well designed and justified?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency in Go, data structures, and algorithms. Good luck!

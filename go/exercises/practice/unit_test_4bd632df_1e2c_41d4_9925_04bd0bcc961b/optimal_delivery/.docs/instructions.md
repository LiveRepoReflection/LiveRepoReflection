Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, incorporating several elements you requested.

## Question: Optimal Multi-Hop Data Delivery

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient data delivery system for a distributed sensor network. The network consists of *N* sensor nodes, each with a unique ID from 0 to *N*-1.  Nodes can communicate with each other within a certain transmission range.  However, due to power constraints and environmental factors, direct communication between all nodes isn't possible. Data must often be relayed through multiple intermediate nodes (multi-hop routing) to reach its destination.

Each sensor node *i* generates a fixed amount of data at a regular interval. This data must be delivered to a central aggregation point (the *sink* node), which is always node 0.  The primary goal is to minimize the *maximum* latency experienced by any single node's data delivery (i.e., minimize the worst-case latency).

You are given the following information:

*   `N`: The number of sensor nodes in the network.
*   `adjMatrix`: An *N* x *N* adjacency matrix representing the network's connectivity. `adjMatrix[i][j] = d` (where d > 0) indicates that nodes *i* and *j* can communicate directly, and `d` represents the latency (in milliseconds) for a single data packet to travel from node *i* to node *j* (or vice-versa). If `adjMatrix[i][j] = 0`, it means there is no direct connection between nodes *i* and *j*.  Note that the matrix is symmetric (undirected graph).
*   `dataGenerationRates`: An array of *N* integers. `dataGenerationRates[i]` represents the rate at which node *i* generates data packets (in packets per second).
*   `processingCapacity`: An integer representing the maximum number of data packets that any single node can process and forward per second. This capacity is the same for all nodes.

**Task:**

Write a Go function `CalculateMinMaxLatency(N int, adjMatrix [][]int, dataGenerationRates []int, processingCapacity int) float64` that calculates the *minimum possible worst-case latency* for delivering data from all sensor nodes to the sink node (node 0).

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= *N* <= 100
*   0 <= `adjMatrix[i][j]` <= 1000
*   0 <= `dataGenerationRates[i]` <= 10
*   1 <= `processingCapacity` <= 100
*   `adjMatrix[i][i] = 0` for all *i*.
*   The network is guaranteed to be connected (there is a path from every node to the sink node).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be efficient. Brute-force approaches that explore all possible routing paths will likely time out.
*   Consider the impact of node processing capacity on the overall latency.  If a node is overloaded, it can significantly increase the latency for data passing through it.
*   Think about how to distribute traffic across multiple paths to avoid overloading any single node.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   If a node's data rate exceeds the `processingCapacity`, it will cause infinite latency, in which case, return `math.MaxFloat64`.
*   If all `dataGenerationRates` are 0, the latency should be 0.
*   The optimal routing may not be the shortest path in terms of hop count; consider the congestion at each node.

**Expected Return Value:**

The function should return a `float64` representing the minimum possible worst-case latency (in milliseconds).

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Does your solution produce the correct minimum worst-case latency for various test cases?
*   **Efficiency:**  Does your solution run within the time limit?  Optimization is critical.
*   **Code Clarity:**  Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem is designed to be difficult. Successfully solving it will require a solid understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases. Good luck!

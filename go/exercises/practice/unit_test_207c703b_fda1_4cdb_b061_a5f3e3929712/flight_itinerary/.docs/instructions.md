## Question Title: Optimal Flight Itinerary with Dynamic Pricing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal flight itinerary for a traveler visiting `N` cities, numbered from 0 to `N-1`. The traveler starts at city 0 and must visit all other cities exactly once before returning to city 0. This is a variation of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

However, this problem introduces a dynamic pricing twist. The cost of flying directly from city `i` to city `j` depends on the *time* of travel (i.e. the number of cities visited). More specifically, the cost is determined by a function `price(i, j, k)`, where `i` is the departure city, `j` is the destination city, and `k` is the number of cities the traveler has already visited (excluding the starting city 0). `k` ranges from 0 (the first flight from city 0) to `N-1` (the last flight before returning to city 0).

You are given the following inputs:

*   `N`: The number of cities.
*   `price(i, j, k)`: A function that returns the cost of flying from city `i` to city `j` after visiting `k` cities.  This function is provided as an external dependency or a closure.  Its signature is `func price(i int, j int, k int) int`. The price is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Your goal is to find the *minimum cost* itinerary that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city (city 0).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Complete Tour:** The itinerary must start at city 0, visit each other city exactly once, and return to city 0.
2.  **Dynamic Pricing:** The flight cost from city `i` to city `j` depends on the number of cities already visited (`k`).  You **must** use the provided `price(i, j, k)` function to determine the cost.  Do not attempt to precompute or store all prices; the function is intended to be called repeatedly during the search.  Assume the cost of flying from a city to itself is prohibited.
3.  **Optimization:** The solution must find the *minimum cost* itinerary.  A brute-force approach is not feasible for larger values of `N`.
4.  **Efficiency:**  The solution should be efficient enough to handle `N` up to 12 within a reasonable time limit (e.g., under 1 minute).  Consider using memoization or other optimization techniques.
5.  **Edge Cases:**  Handle the case where `N` is 1 (only the starting city).  Handle potential integer overflow situations if the total cost becomes very large.
6.  **Complexity:**  The `price()` function itself may have a complex internal calculation, making pre-computation or simple estimations impossible.  You must treat it as a black box.
7. **Price consistency:** The `price()` function is guaranteed to be consistent, meaning that for a given combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`, it will always return the same value within a single execution of the program.

**Example:**

Let's say `N = 3`. The cities are 0, 1, and 2. A possible itinerary is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The total cost would be `price(0, 1, 0) + price(1, 2, 1) + price(2, 0, 2)`.  Your program must find the itinerary that minimizes this total cost.

**Note:** The focus is on algorithmic efficiency and handling the dynamic pricing aspect of the problem. The problem is designed to be challenging and require careful consideration of optimization techniques.

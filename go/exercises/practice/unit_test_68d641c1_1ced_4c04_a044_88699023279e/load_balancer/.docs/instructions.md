Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated, pushing solvers to consider various aspects of algorithm design and optimization in Go.

**Project Name:** `DistributedLoadBalancer`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed load balancer. This load balancer sits in front of a cluster of `N` backend servers. The load balancer needs to efficiently distribute incoming requests to these servers while adhering to the following constraints and requirements:

1.  **Weighted Round Robin Distribution:** Each backend server has a weight associated with it. The load balancer should distribute requests to servers proportional to their weights. For instance, if server A has weight 2 and server B has weight 1, server A should receive twice as many requests as server B over a long period.

2.  **Dynamic Server Pool:** Backend servers can be added or removed from the pool at any time. The load balancer must dynamically adjust its distribution strategy to account for these changes **without disrupting ongoing requests**. The addition/removal will be triggered by an external signal, which updates the server list and their associated weights.

3.  **Health Checks:** The load balancer must periodically perform health checks on the backend servers. If a server fails a health check (e.g., does not respond to a ping within a specified timeout), it should be temporarily removed from the pool until it passes a subsequent health check.  Health check failures must be handled gracefully without causing errors for clients.

4.  **Concurrency:** The load balancer must handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.  Minimize latency and maximize throughput.

5.  **Consistent Hashing (Optional):**  For a bonus challenge, implement consistent hashing as an alternative distribution strategy. When a server is added or removed, only a minimal number of keys should be remapped.  Provide a mechanism to switch between weighted round robin and consistent hashing at runtime.

6.  **Graceful Shutdown:** When the load balancer is shutting down, it should stop accepting new requests but allow existing requests to complete.

7.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. The load balancer should not crash due to unexpected events. Implement a mechanism to log errors and potentially retry failed operations.

8.  **Observability:** Implement logging and metrics to allow for monitoring the load balancer's performance and health. Expose key metrics such as request rate, average latency, and server health status.

**Input:**

The load balancer should be configured with:

*   A list of backend servers, their weights, and their health check endpoints. This configuration can be provided through a configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON) or environment variables.
*   Parameters for health check interval and timeout.

**Output:**

The load balancer should:

*   Listen for incoming requests on a specified port.
*   Distribute requests to backend servers according to the configured strategy (weighted round robin or consistent hashing).
*   Return the response from the backend server to the client.
*   Log relevant events and metrics.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of backend servers (N) can be large (e.g., up to 1000).
*   The weights of the backend servers can vary significantly.
*   The load balancer must handle a high request rate (e.g., thousands of requests per second).
*   The health check interval should be configurable (e.g., from 1 second to 60 seconds).
*   The health check timeout should also be configurable (e.g., from 100 milliseconds to 5 seconds).
*   Assume the backend servers expose a simple HTTP endpoint.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The load balancer must correctly distribute requests according to the specified strategy and handle server failures gracefully.
*   **Performance:** The load balancer must handle a high request rate with low latency.
*   **Scalability:** The load balancer should be able to handle a large number of backend servers.
*   **Robustness:** The load balancer should be resilient to errors and handle unexpected events gracefully.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Observability:** The load balancer should provide sufficient logging and metrics for monitoring its performance and health.

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, networking, data structures, and algorithm design. It also requires careful consideration of edge cases and error handling.  Successful solutions will demonstrate a strong ability to design and implement a robust and scalable distributed system in Go. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level, focusing on performance, and incorporates several complex concepts.

## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Weighted Buckets

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service. This service needs to handle a high volume of requests across multiple servers, ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse.  The rate limiter should be configurable to allow different limits for different users (identified by a unique User ID), and these limits should be dynamically adjustable.

To make it more challenging, implement a concept called "weighted buckets". Each user has a defined number of buckets, each associated with a certain “weight”.  Every time a request comes in, the rate limiter checks against a random bucket assigned to the user.  The request is only allowed if the assigned bucket can accommodate the request without exceeding its weighted limit.

Here is a breakdown of the requirements:

**Functionality:**

1.  **`Allow(userID string, cost int) bool`**: This function is the core of the rate limiter. It determines whether a request from a given `userID` with a given `cost` should be allowed at the current time.

2.  **`UpdateUserLimits(userID string, numBuckets int, bucketWeights []int, totalLimit int)`**:  This function allows updating the rate limits for a specific user.  It takes the `userID`, the number of `buckets` the user should have, an array of `bucketWeights` corresponding to the weight of each bucket, and the overall `totalLimit` of the request tokens the user should have. The `totalLimit` needs to be distributed among the buckets based on the `bucketWeights`.  You must ensure that the sum of `bucketWeights` is always equal to 100. The `totalLimit` should be divided across buckets proportionally to the weights (e.g. if totalLimit is 100, and a bucket has weight 20, then that bucket can allow 20 requests before being full.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

1.  **Distributed Environment:**  Assume your rate limiter service is running on multiple servers. You need to consider how to synchronize rate limit information across these servers.  The easiest method is to assume a single global cache (e.g. Redis) is available for all servers.

2.  **Concurrency:** The `Allow` function will be called concurrently from many goroutines. You need to ensure thread safety.

3.  **Dynamic Limits:** The `UpdateUserLimits` function might be called frequently.  Ensure updates are handled gracefully without disrupting the `Allow` function.

4.  **Bucket Weights:** The sum of `bucketWeights` should always be 100. Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., return an error).

5.  **Bucket Selection:** For each request, a bucket should be selected randomly from the user's configured buckets.  The selection should be fair (uniform distribution).

6.  **Cost:** Requests can have a `cost` associated with them (e.g., more expensive operations consume more of the rate limit).

7.  **Accuracy:** The rate limiter should be reasonably accurate. Minor deviations from the configured limits are acceptable, but significant overages should be avoided.

8.  **Performance:** The `Allow` function needs to be extremely fast. Minimize latency. Strive for amortized O(1) time complexity, or as close as possible.

9.  **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to handle a large number of users.

10. **Memory footprint:** The solution should be memory efficient.

**Optimization Requirements:**

1.  Minimize the number of calls to the global cache.

2.  Implement efficient data structures for storing and retrieving rate limit information.

3.  Consider using techniques like sharding or consistent hashing to distribute the load across the cache.

**Real-World Scenario:**

Imagine this rate limiter is protecting an API endpoint from abuse. Different users have different subscription tiers, which determine their rate limits. The weighted buckets provide a more granular way to manage usage, perhaps allowing users to prioritize certain types of requests over others.

**System Design Aspects:**

Think about how you would deploy and monitor this rate limiter service in a production environment.  Consider factors like fault tolerance, monitoring, and alerting.

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

The core `Allow` function must be highly efficient.  Avoid expensive operations within this function.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

There are several ways to approach this problem. You could use a sliding window algorithm, a token bucket algorithm, or a leaky bucket algorithm.  Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of accuracy, performance, and complexity.

Good luck! This is designed to be a significant challenge.  The key is to carefully consider the constraints and optimize for performance.

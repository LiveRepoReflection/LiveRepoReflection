Okay, challenge accepted. Here's a problem designed to be difficult and require careful consideration of algorithms, data structures, and optimization in Go.

### Project Name

`NetworkRouter`

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a network router that can handle packet routing based on a dynamic routing table. The router operates on a simplified network topology represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents a network device, and each edge represents a direct connection between two devices with an associated cost (latency).

The router maintains a routing table that maps destination IP addresses to the next hop device and the total cost to reach that destination. Your implementation must support the following operations:

1.  **`AddDevice(deviceID string)`:** Adds a new device (node) to the network. Device IDs are unique strings.
2.  **`RemoveDevice(deviceID string)`:** Removes a device from the network and updates the routing table accordingly. Removing a device severs all its connections.
3.  **`AddConnection(sourceID string, destinationID string, cost int)`:** Establishes a direct connection (edge) between two devices with a given latency cost. If a connection already exists between these devices, update its cost. Cost should be a positive integer.
4.  **`RemoveConnection(sourceID string, destinationID string)`:** Removes the direct connection between two devices.
5.  **`UpdateRoutingTable()`:** Recalculates the routing table using the current network topology. The routing table should store the *shortest path* from every device to every other device. The shortest path should be calculated based on minimizing the total cost (latency). Use Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search for pathfinding. If a destination is unreachable from a source, mark it as unreachable (e.g., by assigning a cost of infinity or using a nil next hop).
6.  **`GetNextHop(sourceID string, destinationIP string) (nextHopID string, cost int, reachable bool)`:** Given a source device and a destination IP address, return the ID of the next hop device in the shortest path to the destination, the total cost to reach the destination, and a boolean indicating whether the destination is reachable. If sourceID and destinationIP is the same, return sourceID as nextHopID and cost as 0 and reachable as true. You can assume that each device's ID also represents its IP address.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The network can be large (up to 10,000 devices).
*   Connections can have varying latencies (costs).
*   Devices can be added and removed dynamically.
*   Connections can be added, removed, and updated dynamically.
*   The network topology can change frequently, requiring efficient routing table updates. `UpdateRoutingTable()` should be optimized for performance.
*   Handle cases where devices are unreachable.
*   Handle cases where the source and destination are the same.
*   Handle cases of disconnected subgraphs.
*   Handle invalid device IDs gracefully (e.g., return appropriate errors).
*   The router must be thread-safe, allowing concurrent calls to its methods.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the time complexity of `UpdateRoutingTable()`.  Consider the trade-offs between different shortest path algorithms.
*   Optimize memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of devices and connections.
*   Ensure that `GetNextHop()` has a fast lookup time.

**Real-World Scenario:**

This problem simulates a simplified version of how routers operate in a network. The goal is to design a system that can efficiently adapt to changes in the network topology and ensure that packets are routed along the shortest paths.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Consider the data structures you will use to represent the network topology (graph) and the routing table.
*   Think about how you will handle concurrency and ensure thread safety.
*   Consider the scalability of your solution.

**Example:**

```go
router := NewNetworkRouter()

router.AddDevice("A")
router.AddDevice("B")
router.AddDevice("C")

router.AddConnection("A", "B", 10)
router.AddConnection("B", "C", 15)
router.AddConnection("A", "C", 50)

router.UpdateRoutingTable()

nextHop, cost, reachable := router.GetNextHop("A", "C") // nextHop = "C", cost = 50, reachable = true
nextHop, cost, reachable = router.GetNextHop("A", "B") // nextHop = "B", cost = 10, reachable = true
nextHop, cost, reachable = router.GetNextHop("B", "A") // nextHop = "", cost = infinity, reachable = false  (unreachable - depends on your implementation)

router.RemoveConnection("A", "C")
router.UpdateRoutingTable()

nextHop, cost, reachable = router.GetNextHop("A", "C") // nextHop = "B", cost = 25, reachable = true (A -> B -> C)

```

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, concurrency, and optimization techniques.  Good luck!

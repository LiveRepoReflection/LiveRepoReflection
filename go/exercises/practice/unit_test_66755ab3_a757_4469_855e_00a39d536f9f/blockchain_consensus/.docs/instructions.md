Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithms, and efficiency, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

**Problem Title: Distributed Consensus and Conflict Resolution in a Blockchain Shard**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing the core consensus mechanism for a sharded blockchain. Each shard operates independently but occasionally needs to resolve conflicts arising from cross-shard transactions. Your task is to implement a system that allows nodes within a shard to:

1.  **Propose Transactions:** Each node can propose a set of transactions to be included in the next block. Each transaction is uniquely identified by a string ID.

2.  **Achieve Consensus:** Nodes must reach consensus on the *order* of transactions to be included in the next block using a simplified Paxos-like protocol. The simplified Paxos-like protocol is as follows:
    *   **Propose:** A node proposes an ordered list of transaction IDs.
    *   **Promise:** When a node receives a proposal from another node, it checks whether it has already promised to a proposal with a higher "proposal number". Proposal numbers are integers, where higher values denote more recent proposals. If the node has not promised a higher proposal number or has not promised at all, it promises to the current proposal and stores the proposal number.
    *   **Accept:** After receiving promises from a quorum (a majority) of nodes in the shard, the proposer sends an accept message to all nodes, containing the proposed transaction order.
    *   **Learn:** When a node receives an accept message, it checks if it promised to that proposal number. If so, it accepts the transaction order and stores it. If a node receives multiple accept messages for different proposal numbers, it only accepts the transaction order associated with the highest proposal number it has promised to.

3.  **Resolve Conflicts:** Cross-shard transactions can lead to conflicts. Your system must detect and resolve these conflicts. A conflict occurs if two transactions within the agreed-upon transaction order attempt to modify the same state (e.g., double-spending the same UTXO). To resolve conflicts, the system will prioritize transactions based on a global timestamp.  Transactions with earlier timestamps take precedence. If two conflicting transactions have the same timestamp, the transaction with the lexicographically smaller transaction ID takes precedence.

4.  **Handle Byzantine Faults:** The system must be resilient to a small number of Byzantine (faulty or malicious) nodes within the shard. Specifically, the solution must still achieve consensus and resolve conflicts correctly even if up to `f` nodes (where `f` is strictly less than 1/3 of the total number of nodes) behave arbitrarily. This means that any honest node should eventually agree on the same transaction order.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The total number of nodes in the shard.
*   `f`: The maximum number of Byzantine nodes. `f < N/3`
*   A set of proposed transactions, each with:
    *   A unique ID (string).
    *   A timestamp (integer).
    *   A list of input states (strings - representing UTXOs or other state dependencies).
    *   A list of output states (strings - representing UTXOs or other state changes).
*   A series of messages exchanged between nodes, including propose, promise, accept, and learn messages. These messages will contain:
    *   The sender's node ID.
    *   The recipient's node ID.
    *   The message type (propose, promise, accept, learn).
    *   The proposal number (integer).
    *   The proposed transaction order (list of transaction IDs).

**Output:**

*   The final, agreed-upon and conflict-resolved, ordered list of transaction IDs for the next block. This list must be consistent across all correct (non-Byzantine) nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= N <= 100`
*   `0 <= f < N/3`
*   The number of transactions is variable.
*   Timestamps are non-negative integers.
*   Transaction IDs are unique strings.
*   The system must guarantee liveness (eventually, a block is formed) and safety (all correct nodes agree on the same block).
*   Efficiency is crucial.  The solution should minimize communication overhead and computational complexity. Consider the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms for achieving consensus and conflict resolution.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The primary criterion. The solution must produce the correct, conflict-resolved transaction order for all valid inputs, including those with Byzantine nodes.
*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** The solution must correctly handle scenarios with up to `f` Byzantine nodes.
*   **Efficiency:**  Solutions will be evaluated based on their execution time and memory usage.  Solutions that scale better with increasing numbers of nodes and transactions will be preferred.
*   **Code Clarity:** Well-structured, readable, and maintainable code will be favored.

This problem is designed to be quite challenging and requires a deep understanding of distributed consensus algorithms, data structures, and conflict resolution strategies. Good luck!

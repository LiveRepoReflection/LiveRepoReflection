Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard difficulty question.

**Project Name:** `ConsistentHashing`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a consistent hashing algorithm for a distributed cache system.  This system consists of `N` cache servers, and your goal is to distribute `K` keys across these servers in a way that minimizes data movement when servers are added or removed.

Implement the `ConsistentHashRing` struct with the following functionalities:

1.  **`New(servers []string, replicas int) *ConsistentHashRing`**: Constructor that initializes the hash ring.
    *   `servers`: A slice of strings representing the hostnames or IP addresses of the cache servers.
    *   `replicas`: An integer representing the number of virtual nodes (replicas) per physical server. Increasing replicas improves key distribution.

2.  **`AddServer(server string)`**: Adds a new server to the hash ring.  The server should be assigned `replicas` number of virtual nodes.

3.  **`RemoveServer(server string)`**: Removes a server from the hash ring. All virtual nodes associated with the server should be removed.

4.  **`GetServer(key string) string`**: Returns the hostname or IP address of the server responsible for caching the given `key`.  This should consistently return the same server for the same key, unless the server topology changes.

5.  **`Rebalance(servers []string)`**: Rebalances the hash ring to use the provided `servers`. This requires to remove all servers and adding new servers in order.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Consistent Hashing:** The `GetServer` method must implement consistent hashing. When a server is added or removed, only a minimal number of keys should be re-assigned to different servers.
*   **Key Distribution:** Strive for a relatively even distribution of keys across servers.  The `replicas` parameter should influence this.
*   **Hash Function:**  Use the FNV-1a hash function (provided below) or another well-distributed, non-cryptographic hash function.
*   **Scalability:** Your solution should scale reasonably well to a large number of servers and keys.  Avoid naive approaches that would become inefficient.
*   **Concurrency Safety:** The `ConsistentHashRing` must be safe to use concurrently from multiple goroutines.  Protect shared data structures with appropriate synchronization primitives.
*   **Efficiency:** The `GetServer` method should be as efficient as possible (O(log N) or better, where N is the number of virtual nodes).  Consider using appropriate data structures for efficient lookup.

**FNV-1a Hash Function (for use in your implementation):**

```go
func fnv1aHash(s string) uint32 {
    const prime = uint32(16777619)
    const offsetBasis = uint32(2166136261)

    hash := offsetBasis
    for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
        hash ^= uint32(s[i])
        hash *= prime
    }
    return hash
}
```

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   Empty server list in `New()`.
*   Adding/Removing the same server multiple times.
*   Handling a large number of replicas.
*   Keys hashing to the same value.
*   Concurrency and race conditions.
*   Server removal with no remaining servers.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles.  It encourages you to think about the trade-offs involved in building a distributed system and to optimize for performance and scalability. Good luck!

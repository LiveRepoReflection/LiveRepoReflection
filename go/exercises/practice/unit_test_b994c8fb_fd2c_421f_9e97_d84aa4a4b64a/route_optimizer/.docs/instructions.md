Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test advanced skills and algorithmic thinking.

### Project Name

```
NetworkRouteOptimizer
```

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing an efficient network route optimization system. The system operates on a directed graph representing a network of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a server, and each directed edge represents a network connection between two servers. Each connection has a *latency* (positive integer) and a *bandwidth* (positive integer).

**Goal:** Given a network graph, a source server (node), a destination server (node), and a minimum required bandwidth, find the path with the *lowest total latency* that satisfies the bandwidth requirement. The bandwidth of a path is defined as the *minimum bandwidth* of all edges in that path.

**Input:**

*   A description of the network graph represented as an adjacency list. The adjacency list maps each server (string) to a list of its outgoing connections. Each connection is represented as a tuple: `(destination_server_string, latency_int, bandwidth_int)`.
*   The source server (string).
*   The destination server (string).
*   The minimum required bandwidth (integer).

**Output:**

*   A list of server strings representing the optimal path from the source to the destination server, or an empty list if no such path exists. The path should *not* include cycles (no server should appear more than once in the path).  If multiple paths exist with the same lowest total latency and satisfying the bandwidth requirement, return any one of them.

**Constraints:**

*   The network graph can be large (e.g., up to 10,000 servers and 100,000 connections).
*   Server names are unique strings.
*   Latencies and bandwidths are positive integers.
*   The minimum required bandwidth is a positive integer.
*   You must find a path *without cycles*. If cycles exist in the graph and are necessary to meet bandwidth requirements, the algorithm must detect and avoid them.
*   The solution should be optimized for both time and space complexity. Inefficient solutions may time out.
*   If no path exists that meets the bandwidth requirement, return an empty list.
*   The path should start at the `source` and end at the `destination`.

**Example:**

```
graph := map[string][]struct {Dest string; Latency int; Bandwidth int}{
    "A": {{"B", 10, 50}, {"C", 15, 20}},
    "B": {{"D", 5, 30}},
    "C": {{"D", 20, 40}},
    "D": {},
}
source := "A"
destination := "D"
minBandwidth := 30

// Expected output: ["A", "B", "D"] (total latency: 15)

graph := map[string][]struct {Dest string; Latency int; Bandwidth int}{
    "A": {{"B", 10, 50}, {"C", 15, 20}},
    "B": {{"D", 5, 30}},
    "C": {{"D", 20, 40}},
    "D": {{"A", 1, 100}}, // Introduce a cycle
}
source := "A"
destination := "D"
minBandwidth := 30

// Expected output: ["A", "B", "D"] (cycle D->A should be ignored)

graph := map[string][]struct {Dest string; Latency int; Bandwidth int}{
    "A": {{"B", 10, 50}, {"C", 15, 20}},
    "B": {{"D", 5, 30}},
    "C": {{"D", 20, 40}},
    "D": {},
}
source := "A"
destination := "D"
minBandwidth := 60

// Expected output: [] (No path meets bandwidth requirement)
```

This problem requires careful consideration of graph traversal algorithms (Dijkstra's, BFS, etc.), bandwidth constraints, cycle detection/avoidance, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and handling of complex constraints, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

### Project Name:

```
NetworkFlowOptimization
```

### Question Description:

You are tasked with optimizing the flow of data across a network. The network consists of `n` nodes (numbered 0 to n-1) and `m` directed edges. Each edge has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of data that can flow through it.

**Data Representation:**

The network is represented by:

1.  `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the network.
2.  `edges`: A slice of structs, where each struct represents a directed edge and contains the following fields:

    *   `from`: The source node of the edge (integer, 0-indexed).
    *   `to`: The destination node of the edge (integer, 0-indexed).
    *   `capacity`: The maximum capacity of the edge (integer).

**Problem Statement:**

Given the network described above, a source node `source` and a destination node `sink`, your goal is to find the **maximum possible flow** from the source to the sink.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Valid Flow:** The flow through any edge cannot exceed its capacity. The flow entering any node (except the source and sink) must equal the flow exiting it (flow conservation).
2.  **Negative Capacities:** Edge capacities can be zero or positive. You should handle zero capacities correctly. Negative capacities are invalid and should raise an error.
3.  **Edge Existence:** There can be multiple edges between two nodes, including edges from a node to itself.
4.  **Network Structure:** The network is not guaranteed to be connected. There might be nodes unreachable from the source, or nodes from which the sink is unreachable.
5.  **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient. A naive solution with high time complexity will not pass the test cases. Consider using algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson with Edmonds-Karp (BFS for finding augmenting paths) or Dinic's algorithm to achieve better performance. Time Limit is a factor and very large graphs will be tested.
6.  **Error Handling:** If `source` or `sink` is out of range (less than 0 or greater than or equal to `n`), or if any edge has a negative capacity, your function should return an appropriate error.
7.  **Integer Overflow:** Be mindful of potential integer overflows when calculating flow values.
8.  **Large Networks:** The network can be large (up to 1000 nodes and 10000 edges). Your solution should be able to handle such networks efficiently.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes (int).
*   `edges`: A slice of `Edge` structs describing the network.
*   `source`: The source node (int).
*   `sink`: The sink node (int).

**Output:**

*   The maximum flow from the source to the sink (int).
*   An error if any of the error conditions described above are met.

**Edge Struct Definition:**

```go
type Edge struct {
    from     int
    to       int
    capacity int
}
```

**Function Signature:**

```go
func MaxFlow(n int, edges []Edge, source int, sink int) (int, error) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```
This problem requires a good understanding of network flow algorithms, careful consideration of edge cases, and efficient implementation to handle large input sizes. Good luck!

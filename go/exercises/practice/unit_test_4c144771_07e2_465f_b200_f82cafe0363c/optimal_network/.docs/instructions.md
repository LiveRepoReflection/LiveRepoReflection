### Question Description

A large telecommunications company, "CommsCorp," is planning the deployment of a new 5G network across a sprawling metropolitan area. The area is represented as a graph where nodes are potential base station locations and edges represent the possibility of establishing a direct communication link between two locations. Each location (node) has a different population density and estimated data demand.

CommsCorp has a limited budget and can only deploy a certain number of base stations. Each base station can only handle a limited amount of data traffic.  Furthermore, establishing a communication link (edge) between two locations has a cost.

The goal is to select the optimal set of base station locations and communication links to maximize the total satisfied data demand while staying within the budget constraints. A location's data demand is considered "satisfied" if it is directly covered by a base station or can be reached via a path of communication links from a location that *is* directly covered by a base station and has enough available throughput to cover the demand.

**Specifically, you are given:**

*   `numLocations int`: The number of potential base station locations (nodes in the graph). Locations are numbered from 0 to `numLocations - 1`.
*   `edges [][]int`: A list of communication link options. Each `edge` is a slice containing three integers: `[location1, location2, cost]`, representing a possible link between `location1` and `location2` with a cost `cost`. The graph is undirected (if \[a, b, c] exists, you can traverse from a to b at cost c, or from b to a at cost c).
*   `locationData []LocationData`: A slice containing data about each location.  `locationData[i]` corresponds to the data for location `i`.

```go
type LocationData struct {
    DataDemand int // The data demand of this location.
    Population int // The population of this location. (Optional, could be used for prioritization heuristics).
}
```

*   `baseStationCapacity int`: The maximum data traffic a single base station can handle.
*   `numBaseStationsToDeploy int`: The maximum number of base stations CommsCorp can deploy.
*   `budget int`: The total budget CommsCorp has for deploying base stations *and* establishing communication links.  Deploying a base station at location `i` costs `locationData[i].Population * 10`.
*   `latencyMap [][]int`: A matrix that returns the latency from one location to another, latencyMap\[i]\[j]  represents the latency from location i to location j. If location i cannot reach location j, the return value is -1. The latency should be minimised in your solution.

**Your task is to write a function `OptimalNetworkDeployment` that returns the maximum total satisfied data demand that CommsCorp can achieve within the given constraints.**

```go
func OptimalNetworkDeployment(numLocations int, edges [][]int, locationData []LocationData, baseStationCapacity int, numBaseStationsToDeploy int, budget int) int {
    // Your code here
}
```

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   `1 <= numLocations <= 100`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= numLocations * (numLocations - 1) / 2` (Maximum possible edges in an undirected graph)
*   `1 <= locationData[i].DataDemand <= 1000`
*   `1 <= baseStationCapacity <= 5000`
*   `1 <= numBaseStationsToDeploy <= numLocations`
*   `1 <= budget <= 100000`
*   The cost of a link is always a positive integer.
*   Multiple base stations can not be deployed in the same location.
*   You need to consider both the cost of deploying base stations and the cost of establishing communication links.
*   Latency should be minimised from the user to the base stations.
*   The solution should aim to maximize satisfied data demand while adhering to the budget and base station deployment limits.
*   Assume all inputs are valid.

**Example:** (Illustrative, not a complete test case)

```go
numLocations := 5
edges := [][]int{{0, 1, 10}, {1, 2, 15}, {2, 3, 20}, {3, 4, 25}, {0, 4, 30}}
locationData := []LocationData{{100, 10}, {200, 15}, {300, 20}, {400, 25}, {500, 30}}
baseStationCapacity := 600
numBaseStationsToDeploy := 2
budget := 10000
```

In this example, you'd need to strategically choose which two locations to deploy base stations in and which communication links to establish to maximize the total satisfied data demand, bearing in mind the base station capacity, budget, and link costs.  A naive approach won't work; you'll need to consider various combinations and weigh the trade-offs.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (potentially shortest path), optimization techniques (possibly dynamic programming or greedy approaches with careful pruning), and careful handling of constraints.  The search space is large, requiring efficient pruning to avoid timeouts. Good luck!

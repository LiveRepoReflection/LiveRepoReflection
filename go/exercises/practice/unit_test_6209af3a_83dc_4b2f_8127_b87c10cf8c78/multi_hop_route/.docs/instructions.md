## Problem: Optimal Multi-Hop Route Planner

**Description:**

You are given a network of interconnected servers represented as a weighted, directed graph. Each server is a node in the graph, and the weighted edges represent the latency between servers. You are tasked with designing an optimal route planner that efficiently finds the best path for data transmission between a source server and a destination server, considering a crucial constraint: the data must traverse through a specific set of intermediate servers in a predefined order.

Formally:

*   **Input:**
    *   `N`: The number of servers in the network (nodes in the graph). Servers are numbered from `0` to `N-1`.
    *   `edges`: A list of tuples representing the directed edges in the graph. Each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a directed edge from server `u` to server `v` with a latency of `w`. The latency `w` is a positive integer.
    *   `source`: The ID of the source server.
    *   `destination`: The ID of the destination server.
    *   `intermediates`: A list of server IDs that *must* be traversed in the *exact* order specified.  For example, if `intermediates = [A, B, C]`, the path *must* go through A, then B, then C, in that sequence.

*   **Output:**

    The minimum total latency to transmit data from the `source` server to the `destination` server, passing through all servers in the `intermediates` list in the given order. If no such path exists, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= N * (N - 1)` (Every possible edge between nodes.)
*   `0 <= source, destination, intermediates[i] < N`
*   `1 <= len(intermediates) <= 100`
*   The latency `w` of each edge satisfies `1 <= w <= 1000`.
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   Self-loops (edges from a server to itself) are allowed.
*   The same server ID may appear multiple times in the `intermediates` list.
*   The path must visit the intermediate nodes in the *exact* order provided. Skipping or reordering intermediate nodes is not allowed.
*   You need to consider the time complexity of your solution as the test cases will be designed to penalize inefficient algorithms. Solutions exceeding `O(N^3)` are unlikely to pass all test cases. Try to explore algorithms with time complexity of `O(N^2*K)` where `K` is the length of `intermediates`.
*   If a path is found but the sum of the latencies exceeds `2^31 - 1` (maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer), you should still return `-1`.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 5], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3, 6], [2, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 7], [1, 4, 2]]
source = 0
destination = 4
intermediates = [1, 3]

Output: 14 (0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4: 5 + 6 + 3 = 14; 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4: 3 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 18)
```

**Challenge:**

The primary challenge lies in efficiently finding the shortest path while adhering to the strict intermediate node order constraint. Naive approaches involving brute-force path enumeration will likely be too slow for larger graphs. You will need to carefully consider algorithm selection and data structure usage to optimize for both time and space complexity. Think about how you can leverage existing shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall) while effectively incorporating the intermediate node constraint. Consider memoization or dynamic programming techniques if applicable.

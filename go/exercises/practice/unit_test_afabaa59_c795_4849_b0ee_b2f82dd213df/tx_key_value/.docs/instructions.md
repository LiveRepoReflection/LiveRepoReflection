Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level, incorporating various elements to increase its complexity and demand for optimized solutions.

## Question: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Conflict Resolution

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed key-value store that supports transactional operations and automatic conflict resolution. This key-value store operates across multiple nodes in a cluster and prioritizes consistency and fault tolerance.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Data Model:** The store holds string keys and string values.
2.  **Transactional Operations:** Clients can initiate transactions that involve multiple read and write operations. A transaction ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID).
3.  **Distributed Consensus:** The system must use a simplified form of distributed consensus (similar to Raft or Paxos, but you don't need to implement the full protocol) to agree on the order of transactions and ensure consistency across nodes. Assume a helper function `Agree(data interface{}) interface{}` exists, which simulates a consensus algorithm. It takes any data (e.g., a transaction) and returns the agreed-upon value. This function inherently handles network partitions and node failures, ensuring that a majority of nodes agree on the outcome.
4.  **Conflict Resolution:** When concurrent transactions modify the same key, the system should automatically resolve conflicts using a Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) strategy based on logical timestamps. Each key-value pair should have an associated timestamp. The transaction with the highest timestamp wins.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should tolerate node failures.  Data should be replicated across multiple nodes (replication factor of 3). You can assume a pre-configured list of nodes is available.
6.  **Concurrency:**  The system must be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients efficiently.

**Specific Tasks:**

*   Implement the core data structures for storing key-value pairs with associated timestamps and replicas.
*   Implement the `BeginTransaction()`, `Read(key string)`, `Write(key string, value string)`, and `Commit()` functions.
*   Implement the conflict resolution mechanism using the LWW strategy.
*   Implement the replication logic to ensure data is replicated across 3 nodes.
*   Utilize the `Agree()` function to achieve distributed consensus on transaction order and outcomes.
*   Handle potential network errors and node failures gracefully.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement sharding, consider how your design choices would impact scalability as the number of nodes and data volume increases.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for read and write performance within the constraints of maintaining consistency.  Excessive locking can lead to unacceptable performance.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to deal with various scenarios, such as network errors, node failures, and conflicting transactions.  Return meaningful errors to the client.
*   **Timestamp Generation:**  Implement a logical timestamp generation mechanism that ensures timestamps are monotonically increasing within each node and are unique across the cluster.  Consider using a hybrid logical clock approach.
*   **Simplified Consensus:** The `Agree()` function abstracts away the complexities of a full-fledged consensus algorithm.  Focus on how to integrate its output into your transactional logic.

**Example Usage:**

```go
// Initialize the distributed key-value store with a list of node addresses.
store := NewDistributedKVStore(nodeAddresses)

// Start a transaction.
txID, err := store.BeginTransaction()
if err != nil {
  // Handle error
}

// Read a key.
value, err := store.Read(txID, "mykey")
if err != nil {
  // Handle error
}

// Write a key.
err = store.Write(txID, "mykey", "myvalue")
if err != nil {
  // Handle error
}

// Commit the transaction.
err = store.Commit(txID)
if err != nil {
  // Handle error
}
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The system must correctly implement transactional operations with ACID properties and handle conflicts according to the LWW strategy.
*   Fault Tolerance: The system should tolerate node failures and maintain data consistency.
*   Performance: The system should exhibit reasonable read and write performance.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Error Handling: The system should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
*   Concurrency: The system must correctly handle concurrent transactions without data corruption.
*   Design Choices: Explanation of why you made specific design choices.

This problem is complex and requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and data structures. Good luck!

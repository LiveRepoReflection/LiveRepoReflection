Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem description:

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkDesign`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal communication network between a set of `n` cities. Each city needs to be able to communicate with every other city, either directly or indirectly, through a path of connected cities.  The cost of establishing a direct communication link (edge) between any two cities `i` and `j` is given by a cost function `cost(i, j)`. This cost can be different for each pair of cities and is non-negative.

You are given the following:

*   `n`: The number of cities, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `cost(i, j)`: A function (provided as a function signature in Go) that returns the cost of establishing a direct communication link between city `i` and city `j`.  It's guaranteed that `cost(i, j) == cost(j, i)` and `cost(i, i) = 0`.  The cost function is computationally expensive to call, so you need to minimize its usage.

Your goal is to find the *minimum total cost* required to build a communication network such that all cities can communicate with each other.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

1.  **Connectivity:** The final network must be connected, meaning there must be a path between any two cities.
2.  **Optimization:** You must minimize the total cost of the network.  Brute-force approaches will not be feasible for larger values of `n`.
3.  **Efficiency:** Due to the computational cost of `cost(i, j)`, you must minimize the number of calls to this function. Your solution will be judged not only on correctness but also on the number of calls to the `cost` function.  A solution that is correct but makes significantly more calls to `cost` than necessary will be penalized (or fail).
4.  **Scalability:** Your solution should be able to handle networks with up to `n = 1000` cities within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).  The underlying graph is dense, meaning most cities are potentially connectable.
5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 1`, `n = 2`).
6.  **Memory Usage:**  Keep memory usage under control, especially for larger values of `n`. Avoid creating large, unnecessary data structures.

**Go Function Signature:**

```go
package optimalnetworkdesign

func MinNetworkCost(n int, cost func(int, int) int) int {
	// Your code here
	return 0 // Replace with the minimum total cost
}
```

**Scoring:**

*   **Correctness:**  Your solution must produce the correct minimum total cost for all test cases.
*   **`cost` Function Calls:**  The number of calls to the `cost` function will be measured. Solutions that make a large number of unnecessary calls will be penalized. This is a key aspect of the problem.
*   **Time Complexity:** Your solution must complete within the time limit for all test cases.
*   **Memory Usage:** Keep memory usage within reasonable limits.

**Example:**

Let's say `n = 3`. The `cost` function might return the following:

*   `cost(0, 1) = 10`
*   `cost(0, 2) = 15`
*   `cost(1, 2) = 5`

In this case, the optimal network would be to connect city 1 and city 2 (cost 5), and city 0 and city 1 (cost 10). The total cost would be 15, and the cities are connected: 0-1-2.

A less optimal network would be connecting city 0 to city 1 (cost 10) and city 0 to city 2 (cost 15), with a total cost of 25.

A even less optimal network would be connecting city 0 to city 1 (cost 10), city 0 to city 2 (cost 15) and city 1 to city 2 (cost 5), with a total cost of 30.

**Challenge Hints (These are hints, not solutions!)**

*   Consider using graph algorithms like Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms.  However, be mindful of the `cost` function call constraint.
*   Think about how to efficiently explore the possible connections between cities without exhaustively checking every pair.
*   Explore techniques like lazy evaluation or memoization to reduce redundant calls to the `cost` function.
*   Consider pre-calculating and storing some frequently used cost values, but be careful not to use too much memory.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and efficient coding practices in Go. Good luck!

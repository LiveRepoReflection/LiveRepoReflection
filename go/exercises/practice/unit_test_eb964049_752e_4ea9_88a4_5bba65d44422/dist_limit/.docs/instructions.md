Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging Go coding problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

```
distributed-rate-limiter
```

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter in Go. This rate limiter should control the rate at which clients can access a protected resource across a cluster of servers.

**Scenario:** Imagine you are building a popular online service. To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, you need to limit how frequently each user can access certain endpoints. However, your service is deployed across multiple servers behind a load balancer. A single, in-memory rate limiter on each server won't be effective because a user's requests might be routed to different servers.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed:** The rate limiter must work effectively across a cluster of servers. Requests from the same user should be consistently limited regardless of which server handles the request.
2.  **Configurable:** The rate limiter should allow configuration of:
    *   The rate limit (e.g., X requests per Y seconds).
    *   The resource being protected (identified by a unique key, e.g., user ID, API key, IP address).
3.  **Atomic:** The rate limiting logic must be atomic to prevent race conditions when multiple requests arrive concurrently.
4.  **Efficient:** The rate limiter should be efficient in terms of memory usage and request processing time.  Excessive latency can negatively impact the user experience.
5.  **Fault-Tolerant:** The rate limiter should gracefully handle temporary network issues or failures of individual servers.  It shouldn't become a single point of failure.
6.  **Extensible:** The design should be extensible to support different rate limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window counter) in the future.
7.  **Contraints on data storage:** The chosen data store for rate limiting data must be **in-memory**. Using external databases, file systems, or other external persistent storage is **prohibited**. This forces a focus on efficient in-memory data structures and algorithms to achieve the desired performance and scale. You can use in-memory data structures provided by the standard library such as `sync.Map`.

**Input:**

*   A unique identifier for the resource being protected (string).
*   The current timestamp (Unix timestamp in seconds).

**Output:**

*   A boolean value indicating whether the request is allowed (true) or rate-limited (false).

**Considerations:**

*   How will you handle clock synchronization issues across servers?
*   How will you ensure data consistency across the distributed system without using external database?
*   What data structures will you use to store rate limiting information efficiently?
*   How will you handle potential memory exhaustion if the number of unique resources being tracked grows very large?
*   What concurrency primitives will you use to ensure atomicity and prevent race conditions?
*   How does the design trade off between accuracy, efficiency, and fault tolerance?
*   How can you design for extensibility with various rate limiting algorithms?
*   How does your solution scale horizontally as the number of servers and request volume increases?

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems principles, concurrency in Go, and efficient data structures. The constraints on in-memory storage makes the problem more challenging. Good luck!

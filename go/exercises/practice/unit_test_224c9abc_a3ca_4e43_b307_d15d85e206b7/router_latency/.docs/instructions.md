## Question: Optimal Router Placement for Minimizing Latency

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a network infrastructure for a new data center. The data center consists of `N` servers, represented as nodes in a graph. The connections between servers are represented as edges in the graph, with each edge having a specific latency value. Your goal is to strategically place `K` routers within the data center to minimize the maximum latency experienced by any server when communicating with a router.

Each server must be connected to at least one router. The latency between a server and a router is defined as the shortest path distance between them in the graph. If a server is directly connected to a router, the latency is simply the edge weight.

Your objective is to select the optimal `K` server locations to host the routers, such that the maximum latency from any server to its nearest router is minimized.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of servers in the data center (1 <= `N` <= 500).
*   `K`: The number of routers to place (1 <= `K` <= min(20, `N`)).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents an undirected edge between server `u` and server `v` with latency `w` (1 <= `u`, `v` <= `N`, 1 <= `w` <= 1000).  Server indices are 1-based.
*   `edges` will not contain duplicate edges and there will be no self-loops. The graph will be connected.

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum possible maximum latency from any server to its nearest router, given the optimal router placement.  If it is impossible to place the routers given the constraints, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   Your solution must have a time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup> * log(N) * 2<sup>N</sup>) or better.  Solutions that exceed this time complexity will likely time out.
*   The graph is undirected and connected.
*   All edge weights are positive integers.
*   You must use the Go programming language.
*   Consider memory usage, since large graphs can consume significant resources.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
K = 2
edges = [[1, 2, 10], [2, 3, 10], [3, 4, 10], [4, 1, 10]]

Optimal router placement: Servers 1 and 3.
Maximum latency: 10

Output: 10
```

**Clarifications:**

*   You need to determine *which* `K` servers to designate as router locations.
*   The latency between a server and its nearest router is the minimum of the shortest path distances from that server to each of the `K` routers.
*   The final result is the *maximum* of these minimum latencies across all servers.
*   You are allowed to have multiple servers use the same router.
*   The shortest path between any two servers can be efficiently computed by Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path finding), combinatorial reasoning (choosing router locations), and optimization techniques to meet the time complexity constraints. Good luck!

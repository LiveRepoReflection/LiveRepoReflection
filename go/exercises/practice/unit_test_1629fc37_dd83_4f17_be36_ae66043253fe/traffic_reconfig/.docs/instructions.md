## Question: Optimal Traffic Flow Reconfiguration

### Question Description

A major metropolitan area has a complex road network represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents an intersection, and each directed edge represents a road segment connecting two intersections. Each road segment has a capacity, representing the maximum number of vehicles that can traverse it per unit of time.

Due to an unforeseen event (e.g., a major sporting event, a parade, or a natural disaster), certain road segments have reduced capacity. You are tasked with reconfiguring traffic flow to minimize the overall impact of these capacity reductions on the total traffic throughput from a designated source intersection to a designated destination intersection.

You are given:

*   `n`: The number of intersections (nodes) in the road network, numbered from 0 to n-1.
*   `edges`: A list of directed edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(u, v, capacity)`, indicating a road segment from intersection `u` to intersection `v` with a given `capacity`.
*   `reduced_edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, reduced_capacity)` indicating the edges where the capacity is reduced from the original capacity, where `reduced_capacity` is the new capacity of the road from intersection `u` to intersection `v`.
*   `source`: The index of the source intersection.
*   `destination`: The index of the destination intersection.

Your goal is to determine the **maximum possible traffic flow** from the `source` to the `destination` after applying the capacity reductions.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `n` <= 500
*   0 <= `source`, `destination` < `n`
*   `source` != `destination`
*   0 <= `u`, `v` < `n` for all edges
*   1 <= `capacity` <= 10<sup>6</sup> for all edges
*   0 <= `reduced_capacity` <= 10<sup>6</sup> for all reduced edges. `reduced_capacity` will not be greater than the `capacity` for that edge.
*   There may be multiple edges between two intersections.
*   The graph may not be strongly connected.
*   The graph contains no self-loops.
*   All `(u,v)` pairs in `reduced_edges` will always be present in the original `edges` list.

**Optimization Requirements:**

Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large graphs with many edges. An inefficient solution (e.g., one with high time complexity or memory usage) may result in exceeding the time or memory limits.  Consider algorithmic efficiency.

**Multiple Valid Approaches and Trade-offs:**

Classical network flow algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp can be used to solve this problem. However, since the problem involves modifying edge capacities, you should carefully consider how to apply these algorithms to achieve optimal performance. You might need to modify the graph structure to handle multiple edges between nodes. Choosing the right algorithm and data structures will impact the time and space complexity of your solution. Consider the trade-offs between these choices.

**Edge Cases and Constraints:**

*   The graph may not have a path from the source to the destination. In this case, the maximum flow is 0.
*   The reduced capacity could be 0 for some edges, effectively removing them from the network.
*   The number of `reduced_edges` may be equal to or less than the number of `edges`.

**Real-World Practical Scenarios:**

This problem is a simplified model of real-world traffic flow optimization, where understanding the impact of road closures or capacity reductions is crucial for managing traffic and minimizing congestion. The solution should aim to quickly and accurately determine the optimal traffic flow under such constraints.

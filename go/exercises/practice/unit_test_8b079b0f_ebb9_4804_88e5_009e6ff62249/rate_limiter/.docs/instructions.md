**Distributed Rate Limiter**

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service in Go. This service will be used to protect various backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. The rate limiter must be highly available, scalable, and efficient.

**Functionality:**

The rate limiter should allow clients to check if a request can be processed based on a defined rate limit. The rate limit is defined per client identifier (e.g., API key, user ID) and represents the maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time window.  If a client exceeds its rate limit, the service should reject the request.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Rate Limit Definition:** The rate limit should be configurable per client identifier.  It should specify the maximum number of requests allowed (e.g., 1000) and the time window (e.g., 60 seconds). The rate limit configurations should be dynamically updateable without restarting the service (e.g. using an API endpoint to update limits).

2.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter service will be deployed across multiple nodes. The service must correctly handle concurrent requests from different nodes and ensure that rate limits are enforced consistently across the entire distributed system.

3.  **Data Consistency:** The service must maintain consistent rate limit counters across all nodes, even in the presence of node failures or network partitions.  Consider using a strongly consistent data store.

4.  **High Availability:** The service should be highly available and fault-tolerant.  It should automatically recover from node failures and continue to operate correctly.

5.  **Scalability:** The service should be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent requests and client identifiers.

6.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter should be as efficient as possible to minimize latency and resource consumption.

7.  **Atomicity:** Incrementing the request counter and checking the limit must be atomic to avoid race conditions.

8.  **Graceful Degradation:** In the event of a complete failure of the underlying data store, the rate limiter should enter a "graceful degradation" mode.  In this mode, all requests should be allowed to pass through.  This is preferred over completely blocking all traffic.  Logging should clearly indicate when the rate limiter is in this mode.

9.  **Metrics:** Implement basic metrics to monitor the performance of the rate limiter, including:
    *   Number of requests received
    *   Number of requests allowed
    *   Number of requests rejected
    *   Latency of rate limit checks
    *   Current number of connected nodes
    *   Status of the underlying data store

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the distributed system is not fixed and can change dynamically.
*   Network latency between nodes can vary.
*   The number of client identifiers can be very large (millions or billions).
*   Rate limit configurations can change frequently.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Handling of extremely high request rates.
*   Dealing with network partitions and node failures.
*   Dynamically updating rate limits while requests are being processed.
*   Handling clients with very low or zero request limits.
*   Dealing with time synchronization issues across nodes (consider NTP).

**Considerations:**

*   Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient rate limit checking.
*   Select a suitable distributed data store for storing and updating rate limit counters (e.g., Redis, etcd, CockroachDB, or a custom-built solution). Consider the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance.
*   Implement appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure data consistency.
*   Design an API for clients to check rate limits and for administrators to manage rate limit configurations.
*   Consider the impact of time skew on rate limiting accuracy.
*   Think about how to handle different types of rate limiting algorithms (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window, sliding window). You are free to choose the algorithm which you believe is most appropriate for this problem, however, explain your reasoning in your solution.
*   Explain the trade-offs of different solutions and why you chose your approach.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and Go programming.  It also requires careful consideration of various trade-offs and edge cases. Good luck!

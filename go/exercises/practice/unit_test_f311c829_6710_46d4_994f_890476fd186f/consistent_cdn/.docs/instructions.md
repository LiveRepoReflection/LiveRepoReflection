Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem.

**Project Name:** `ConsistentHashingCDN`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a simplified Content Delivery Network (CDN) using consistent hashing.  The CDN consists of a cluster of caching servers distributed geographically.  When a client requests content (identified by a unique string key), the system must determine which caching server should serve that content.

The CDN must meet the following requirements:

1.  **Consistent Hashing:** Use consistent hashing to map content keys to caching servers. This ensures minimal disruption when servers are added or removed from the cluster. Use a simple hashing algorithm like MD5 or SHA-256 (you don't need to implement the hashing algorithm itself, just use a library).

2.  **Dynamic Server Pool:** The set of caching servers can change dynamically.  Servers can be added to or removed from the cluster at any time.

3.  **Content Replication (Optional):** To improve availability and fault tolerance, implement content replication.  Each content key should be stored on `k` servers, where `k` is a configurable replication factor.  When retrieving content, prioritize serving from the "primary" server (the one that would be selected with a replication factor of 1) but allow serving from any of the `k` replicas if the primary is unavailable.

4.  **Load Balancing:**  The consistent hashing algorithm should distribute content keys relatively evenly across the caching servers.

5.  **Server Availability:**  Track the availability of each server. If a server is marked as unavailable, it should not be selected for serving content until it becomes available again.

6.  **Efficient Key Retrieval:**  Given a content key, the system should efficiently determine the responsible server(s) for serving that content.

7.  **Scalability:** The solution should be designed to handle a large number of content keys and a large number of caching servers.

8.  **Concurrency:** The CDN system should be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests efficiently.

**Input:**

The system must support the following operations:

*   `AddServer(serverID string)`: Adds a new caching server with the given ID to the cluster.
*   `RemoveServer(serverID string)`: Removes the caching server with the given ID from the cluster.
*   `SetServerAvailability(serverID string, available bool)`: Sets the availability status of the caching server with the given ID.
*   `GetServerForKey(key string)`: Returns the ID of the caching server responsible for serving the content key.  If replication is enabled (k > 1), return the primary server.
*   `GetReplicasForKey(key string)`: Returns a list of `k` server IDs responsible for serving the content key, ordered by preference (primary first).  If `k` is 1, this is equivalent to `GetServerForKey`. Only return available servers. Return less than k servers if there are less than k available servers.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of caching servers can be up to 10,000.
*   The number of content keys can be very large (millions or billions).
*   The replication factor `k` is a configurable parameter (default value is 1).
*   Server IDs and content keys are strings.
*   The system must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests.
*   The system must be resilient to server failures.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the impact of server additions and removals on content distribution.
*   Optimize the `GetServerForKey` and `GetReplicasForKey` operations for speed.
*   Minimize memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of content keys and caching servers.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on the following criteria:

*   Correctness: The system must correctly implement consistent hashing and content replication.
*   Efficiency: The system must be able to handle a large number of content keys and caching servers efficiently.
*   Scalability: The system must be designed to scale to handle a large number of requests.
*   Concurrency: The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests efficiently.
*   Resilience: The system must be resilient to server failures.
*   Code Quality: The code must be well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand.

This problem requires a solid understanding of consistent hashing, data structures, and concurrency in Go. Good luck!

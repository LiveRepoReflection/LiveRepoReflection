## Project Name:

**Network Optimization with Dynamic Routing**

## Question Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a network routing algorithm for a dynamic network topology. The network consists of `N` nodes, where `N` can be a large number (up to 10^5). Each node has a unique ID from `0` to `N-1`. The connections between nodes (edges) can change dynamically over time. Your goal is to efficiently determine the shortest path between any two nodes at any given time, considering the current network topology.

Specifically, you need to implement a system that can handle the following operations:

1.  **`AddEdge(node1, node2, weight)`:** Adds an undirected edge between `node1` and `node2` with a given `weight`. If the edge already exists, update its weight to the new value.

2.  **`RemoveEdge(node1, node2)`:** Removes the undirected edge between `node1` and `node2`. If the edge does not exist, do nothing.

3.  **`GetShortestPath(startNode, endNode)`:** Returns the shortest path (minimum total weight) between `startNode` and `endNode` in the current network. If no path exists, return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes `N` is between 1 and 10^5.
*   The number of operations (AddEdge, RemoveEdge, GetShortestPath) is between 1 and 10^6.
*   Node IDs are integers between 0 and `N-1`.
*   Edge weights are positive integers between 1 and 10^4.
*   The network is initially empty (no edges).
*   The `AddEdge` and `RemoveEdge` operations should be efficient, ideally with an average time complexity better than O(N).
*   The `GetShortestPath` operation should be reasonably efficient, considering the dynamic nature of the graph. Aim for an average time complexity better than O(N^2) if possible.
*   Memory usage should be optimized to avoid exceeding reasonable limits, especially with a large number of nodes and edges.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about the trade-offs between different shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, A\*, Bellman-Ford) in a dynamic environment.
*   Consider data structures that allow efficient edge addition, removal, and weight updates.
*   Think about how to optimize the shortest path calculation when the graph changes incrementally. Can you reuse previous calculations?
*   Be mindful of potential edge cases such as disconnected graphs, self-loops, and negative weight cycles (though negative weights are not explicitly allowed, your solution should handle them gracefully, perhaps by returning an error or indicating an invalid path).
*   Consider how to represent the graph (adjacency list, adjacency matrix) and the implications for performance and memory usage.
*   Think about how to handle concurrent requests (if applicable, but not strictly required for a single-threaded solution).

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and performance optimization techniques. The dynamic nature of the network adds a significant layer of complexity, requiring you to think carefully about the efficiency of your solution.

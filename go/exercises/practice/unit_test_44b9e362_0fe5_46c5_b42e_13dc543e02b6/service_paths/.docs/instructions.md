## Question: Optimizing Inter-Service Communication Paths

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a critical component of a distributed system responsible for optimizing communication paths between services. The system consists of a large number of microservices, each identified by a unique integer ID. Services need to communicate with each other, and the cost of communication varies depending on the path taken.

The service network can be represented as a weighted directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent microservices (identified by their integer ID).
*   Edges represent possible communication channels between services.
*   Edge weights represent the cost of communication along that channel (a positive integer).

Your task is to implement a function that, given the service network graph and a set of communication requests, determines the *k* cheapest communication paths for each request, where *k* is a given parameter.

**Input:**

*   `numServices`: An integer representing the total number of microservices (nodes in the graph). Microservice IDs range from 0 to `numServices - 1`.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a directed edge from service `u` to service `v` with a cost of `w`.
*   `requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(start, end)` represents a communication request from service `start` to service `end`.
*   `k`: An integer representing the number of cheapest paths to find for each request.

**Output:**

A list of lists of integers. The outer list represents each request in the order given in the `requests` input. The inner list contains the costs of the *k* cheapest paths for that request, sorted in ascending order. If a request has fewer than *k* paths, the inner list should contain all available path costs. If there is no path between `start` and `end`, the inner list should be empty.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numServices <= 1000`
*   `0 <= len(edges) <= 10000`
*   `0 <= u, v < numServices` for each edge `(u, v, w)`
*   `1 <= w <= 1000` for each edge `(u, v, w)`
*   `0 <= len(requests) <= 100`
*   `0 <= start, end < numServices` for each request `(start, end)`
*   `1 <= k <= 10`

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient, especially for a large number of services and requests. Naive solutions (e.g., repeatedly calculating shortest paths for each request) are unlikely to pass all test cases.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize path finding and cost tracking.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   There may be multiple edges between the same pair of services (representing different communication channels with varying costs).
*   The graph may be disconnected.
*   The `start` and `end` services in a request may be the same.  In this case, a path of cost 0 should be included if the service exists in the graph and k > 0. If the start/end node doesn't exist, return an empty list.

**Example:**

```
numServices = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 3), (1, 3, 6), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (2, 4, 4), (1,4,2)]
requests = [(0, 4), (1, 4)]
k = 2

Output: [[6, 7], [2, 3]]

Explanation:
For request (0, 4):
Path 1: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (cost: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6)
Path 2: 0 -> 2 -> 4 (cost: 3 + 4 = 7)
Path 3: 0 -> 1 -> 4 (cost: 5 + 2 = 7)
Path 4: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (cost: 5 + 6 + 1 = 12)
The 2 cheapest paths are 6 and 7.

For request (1, 4):
Path 1: 1 -> 4 (cost: 2)
Path 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4 (cost: 6 + 1 = 7)
The 2 cheapest paths are 2 and 7.
```

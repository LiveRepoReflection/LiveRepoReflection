Okay, here's a problem designed to be a challenging "Hard" level problem in Go, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization, and real-world context.

**Project Name:** `ScalableSocialGraph`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable social graph service. This service needs to efficiently handle a massive number of users and their connections (friendships/followers). The core functionality revolves around suggesting potential new connections to users based on shared interests and network proximity.

Specifically, the service must support the following operations:

1.  **`AddUser(userID string, interests []string)`**: Adds a new user to the social graph.  The `userID` is a unique identifier.  The `interests` are a list of strings representing the user's interests (e.g., "Go", "Machine Learning", "Hiking"). Assume interests are case-sensitive.

2.  **`RemoveUser(userID string)`**: Removes a user from the social graph, disconnecting them from all existing connections.

3.  **`Connect(userID1 string, userID2 string)`**: Creates a directed connection from `userID1` to `userID2` (i.e., `userID1` follows `userID2`). The connection is *not* bidirectional unless explicitly created in both directions. Connections should be unique; duplicate connections are ignored.

4.  **`Disconnect(userID1 string, userID2 string)`**: Removes the directed connection from `userID1` to `userID2`.

5.  **`GetRecommendations(userID string, maxRecommendations int)`**: This is the core, most complex operation. It should return a list of at most `maxRecommendations` `userID`s representing the best recommendations for the given `userID`. Recommendations should be determined using the following criteria, in order of priority:

    *   **Shared Interests:** Prioritize users who share the most interests with the target user.
    *   **Network Proximity (up to 2 degrees of separation):**  Consider users who are friends of friends (2nd-degree connections) before considering entirely disconnected users. Direct friends (1st-degree connections) should *never* be recommended.  The closer the connection, the higher the priority.
    *   **Avoid Duplicates:** Do not return the same user multiple times.
    *   **Avoid Already Connected Users:** Do not recommend users to whom the target user is already connected (directly or indirectly â€“ *bidirectionally*). That is, if A follows B, or B follows A, then B should not be recommended to A. Implement efficient cycle detection to handle mutual connections.
    *   **Tie-breaking:** If users have the same number of shared interests and are at the same degree of separation, prioritize users with numerically smaller `userID` strings (lexicographical order).
    *   **Order of Recommendations**: From the above sorted list, return top `maxRecommendations` userIDs.
6.  **`GetSize()`**: Returns the total number of users in the graph. This should be an O(1) operation.
**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The service should be designed to handle millions of users and connections. Naive implementations will likely time out. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient storage and retrieval.
*   **Performance:** The `GetRecommendations` function must be optimized for speed. Minimize the number of graph traversals and interest comparisons.  Pre-computation and caching strategies are encouraged, but must be carefully implemented to avoid stale data.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory consumption, especially when dealing with a large number of users.
*   **Concurrency:**  The service should be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent requests. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels) to prevent data corruption.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-existent user IDs).
*   **Real-World Considerations:** Think about how this service would be deployed in a real-world environment. Consider potential bottlenecks and how to address them.
*   **UserID**: UserIDs can contain any ASCII characters and are case-sensitive.
*   **maxRecommendations**: The value of `maxRecommendations` can be between 0 and 1000.
*   **Optimizations**: Focus on optimizing for GetRecommendations(). All other operations should still be performant but GetRecommendations() should be the main focus.

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles. Good luck!

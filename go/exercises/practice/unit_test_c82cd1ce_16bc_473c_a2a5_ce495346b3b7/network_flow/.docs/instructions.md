## Question Description

You are tasked with optimizing the data flow in a large-scale distributed system. The system consists of `N` nodes (numbered from 0 to N-1) connected by a network. Data packets need to be routed from various source nodes to their respective destination nodes efficiently, minimizing the overall network congestion.

Each node has a processing capacity, representing the maximum number of packets it can handle simultaneously. Each connection between two nodes has a bandwidth capacity, representing the maximum number of packets that can be transmitted per unit of time.

You are given:

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `capacities`: A 2D array representing the bandwidth capacities between nodes. `capacities[i][j]` represents the bandwidth capacity between node `i` and node `j`. If there is no direct connection between `i` and `j`, `capacities[i][j] = 0`. The graph is undirected, so `capacities[i][j] == capacities[j][i]`.
*   `node_capacities`: An array representing the processing capacity of each node. `node_capacities[i]` represents the processing capacity of node `i`.
*   `requests`: A 2D array representing data transfer requests. `requests[i][0]` is the source node, `requests[i][1]` is the destination node, and `requests[i][2]` is the number of packets that need to be transferred from the source to the destination. All packets for a single request **must** take the same path.

Your goal is to determine the **maximum number of requests that can be fully satisfied**, while respecting both the bandwidth capacities of the connections and the processing capacities of the nodes. You need to find a routing strategy for the requests such that the total number of satisfied requests is maximized.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 50`
*   `0 <= capacities[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= node_capacities[i] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= number of requests <= 1000`
*   `0 <= requests[i][0], requests[i][1] < N`
*   `1 <= requests[i][2] <= 1000`
*   A node cannot forward packets to itself.
*   All requests must be fully routed or not routed at all. No partial fulfillment of requests is allowed.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The solution should be efficient enough to handle large input sizes within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider the time complexity of your algorithm carefully.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The network may not be fully connected.
*   Some requests may be impossible to satisfy due to insufficient capacity.
*   The optimal solution may require rejecting some seemingly viable requests to accommodate other requests, thus maximizing the number of fulfilled requests.
*   Multiple requests may originate from or be destined for the same node.
*   The same (source, destination, packet amount) request may be in the requests array multiple times. Count each such instance as a separate request.

**Example:**

```
N = 3
capacities = [[0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0]]
node_capacities = [10, 10, 10]
requests = [[0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 2], [1, 2, 4]]
```

One possible solution is to accept the first two requests (0 -> 2, 3 packets) and (0 -> 2, 2 packets), routing them through node 1. However, this would exceed the capacity of the edge between node 1 and node 2. A better solution would be to accept the first request (0 -> 2, 3 packets) and the third request (1 -> 2, 4 packets), which can be routed directly. Therefore, the maximum number of satisfied requests is 2.

**Clarification:**

You only need to return the *maximum number of requests that can be fully satisfied*.  You do not need to return the actual routing paths or the specific requests that were satisfied. You just need to maximize the *count* of satisfied requests.

Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition:

**Project Name:** Time-Based Key-Value Store with Conflict Resolution

**Question Description:**

Design and implement a distributed, time-based key-value store. This store must support the following operations:

*   `Set(key string, value string, timestamp int64)`: Sets the given *key* to the given *value* at the given *timestamp*. Multiple values can be stored for the same key at different timestamps. Timestamps are Unix epoch milliseconds.
*   `Get(key string, timestamp int64)`: Retrieves the *value* associated with the given *key* at or before the given *timestamp*. If multiple values exist at or before the specified timestamp, return the value with the **largest timestamp** that is less than or equal to the given timestamp. If no such value exists, return an empty string.
*   `MultiGet(keys []string, timestamp int64)`: Retrieves the values for multiple keys at the given timestamp. Returns a map where the key is the input key and the value is the result of calling `Get(key, timestamp)`.
*   `RangeGet(key string, startTime int64, endTime int64)`: Retrieves all key-value pairs for the given *key* where the timestamp falls within the range `[startTime, endTime]` (inclusive). The returned values should be sorted in ascending order by timestamp.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed System**: The store must be designed as a distributed system. Implement a simplified version with in-memory data storage to simulate distribution. Assume that the operations can be executed concurrently on multiple nodes.
2.  **Conflict Resolution**: In a distributed environment, concurrent `Set` operations may occur for the same key and timestamp. Implement a last-write-wins conflict resolution strategy based on node ID. Assume each node has a unique integer ID. If multiple `Set` operations occur for the same key and timestamp, the one originating from the node with the **highest ID** wins.
3.  **Scalability**: The system should be designed to handle a large number of keys and timestamps efficiently. Consider data structures and algorithms that optimize for read and write performance.
4.  **Concurrency**: Implement proper locking mechanisms to ensure data consistency and avoid race conditions during concurrent `Set`, `Get`, `MultiGet`, and `RangeGet` operations.
5.  **Memory Efficiency**: Strive to minimize memory usage. Store timestamps as `int64` and values as `string`.
6.  **Time Complexity**: `Get` and `MultiGet` operations should have an average time complexity of O(log N) where N is the number of timestamps for a given key. `Set` operations should also be optimized for performance. `RangeGet` should be O(K + log N) where K is the number of elements inside the range.
7.  **Edge Cases**:
    *   Handle cases where the key does not exist.
    *   Handle cases where no value exists at or before the specified timestamp in `Get`.
    *   Handle large timestamp ranges in `RangeGet`.
    *   Handle empty input arrays for `MultiGet`.
8.  **Correctness**: The system must return the correct values according to the specified rules, even under concurrent operations.
9.  **Bonus:**
    *   Implement a persistence mechanism to load data from disk on startup and persist changes periodically.
    *   Implement a simple API endpoint that can call these functions.
    *   Implement a cache for the most recent values.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems concepts. The focus is on designing a system that is both correct and efficient, especially under heavy load and concurrent operations.

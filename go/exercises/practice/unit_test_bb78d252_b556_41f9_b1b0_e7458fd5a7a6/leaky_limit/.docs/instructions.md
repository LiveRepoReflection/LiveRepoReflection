Okay, here is a challenging Go coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and system design considerations.

## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter with Leaky Bucket

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter using the Leaky Bucket algorithm. This rate limiter will be used to protect a critical microservice from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. The rate limiter must be highly performant, scalable, and resilient to failures.

The system receives requests identified by a unique `client_id`. Each client has its own bucket.

**Functional Requirements:**

1.  **`Allow(client_id string, quantity int) bool`:** This function is the core of the rate limiter. It takes a `client_id` (a string identifying the client making the request) and a `quantity` (the number of tokens the request consumes). It returns `true` if the request is allowed (tokens are available), and `false` otherwise.
2.  **Rate Limiting Configuration:** The rate limiter must be configurable with the following parameters:
    *   `capacity`: The maximum number of tokens each client's bucket can hold.
    *   `leak_rate`: The rate at which tokens leak from each client's bucket (tokens per second).
3.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must be able to run across multiple nodes in a cluster. Client requests should be consistently routed to the same node to maintain bucket state.
4.  **Concurrency:**  The rate limiter must handle concurrent requests from multiple clients efficiently.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Performance:** The `Allow` function must have low latency (ideally sub-millisecond for the 99th percentile).
2.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of clients (millions) and a high request rate (thousands per second).
3.  **Consistency:** The rate limiter must provide strong consistency. If a request is allowed, subsequent requests to the same client on any node should reflect the token consumption.
4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to node failures. If a node goes down, requests for clients previously handled by that node should be handled by another node with minimal disruption.  Ideally, lost bucket state should be recoverable.
5.  **Memory Efficiency:** The rate limiter should minimize memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of clients.

**Constraints:**

1.  You are free to use any in-memory data store (e.g., Redis, Memcached, or a custom implementation) for storing bucket state.  Consider the trade-offs of each option.
2.  Assume a reasonable network latency between nodes in the cluster (e.g., < 1ms).
3.  You do not need to handle persistence of bucket state to disk. Focus on in-memory operation and recovery from node failures through replication or other mechanisms.
4.  Assume a simple consistent hashing mechanism is in place to route requests to the correct node based on `client_id`. You do not need to implement the consistent hashing.
5.  Assume all numerical values (`capacity`, `leak_rate`, `quantity`) are positive integers.

**Bonus Challenges:**

1.  Implement a mechanism for automatically adjusting `capacity` and `leak_rate` based on real-time traffic patterns.
2.  Provide metrics and monitoring capabilities to track rate limiting effectiveness and system health.
3.  Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures if the in-memory data store becomes unavailable.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures (how to represent the leaky bucket), concurrency control (handling concurrent access to buckets), and distributed systems principles (consistency, fault tolerance).  A successful solution will demonstrate a strong understanding of these concepts and the ability to apply them in a practical scenario. Good luck!

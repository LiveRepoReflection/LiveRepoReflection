Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem, designed to be at a LeetCode Hard level.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator. This coordinator is responsible for ensuring atomicity and consistency across multiple independent services (participants) in a distributed system.  The coordinator implements a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

Imagine you have a system where you need to update data across multiple independent databases (or services). To ensure data consistency, these updates must either all succeed, or all fail. This is where a distributed transaction coordinator comes in.

**Participants:**

*   Each participant is represented by a unique string identifier.
*   Each participant exposes a simple API:
    *   `Prepare(transactionID string) error`:  The participant tries to prepare for the transaction. This might involve taking locks, validating data, etc. Returns `nil` on success, an error otherwise.  The participant must be able to undo any changes made during the Prepare phase if the transaction is later aborted.  The participant *must* be idempotent regarding `Prepare` calls for the same `transactionID`.  That is, calling `Prepare` multiple times with the same `transactionID` should have the same effect as calling it once.
    *   `Commit(transactionID string) error`:  The participant permanently commits the transaction. Returns `nil` on success, an error otherwise. The participant *must* be idempotent regarding `Commit` calls for the same `transactionID`.
    *   `Rollback(transactionID string) error`: The participant rolls back the transaction, undoing any changes made during the Prepare phase. Returns `nil` on success, an error otherwise. The participant *must* be idempotent regarding `Rollback` calls for the same `transactionID`.

**Coordinator:**

Your task is to implement the coordinator. The coordinator should provide the following function:

*   `ExecuteTransaction(transactionID string, participants []string, prepareFunc func(participant string, transactionID string) error, commitFunc func(participant string, transactionID string) error, rollbackFunc func(participant string, transactionID string) error) error`:

    This function attempts to execute a distributed transaction.

    1.  **Prepare Phase:** The coordinator should call `prepareFunc` for each participant *concurrently*.
    2.  If *all* participants successfully prepare, the coordinator should proceed to the **Commit Phase**.
    3.  **Commit Phase:** The coordinator should call `commitFunc` for each participant *concurrently*. If any commit fails, it should log the error but proceed with attempting to commit the remaining participants. The transaction is considered failed in the `ExecuteTransaction` function return if any commit fails.
    4.  If *any* participant fails to prepare, the coordinator should proceed to the **Rollback Phase**.
    5.  **Rollback Phase:** The coordinator should call `rollbackFunc` for each participant that successfully prepared, *concurrently*.  Again, if any rollback fails, log the error but proceed with attempting to rollback the remaining participants. The transaction is considered failed in the `ExecuteTransaction` function return if any rollback fails.

    The `ExecuteTransaction` function should return an error if either:

    *   Any participant fails to prepare.
    *   Any participant fails to commit.
    *   Any participant fails to rollback.

    If all operations succeed, the function should return `nil`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:**  The Prepare, Commit, and Rollback phases *must* be executed concurrently using goroutines.  This is critical for performance.
*   **Idempotency:** The participant functions (`Prepare`, `Commit`, `Rollback`) *must* be idempotent.  The coordinator might retry operations.
*   **Error Handling:**  The coordinator must handle errors gracefully.  It should log errors during the Commit and Rollback phases without halting the entire process.  It *must* attempt to commit or rollback all participants even if some operations fail.
*   **Timeout:**  Implement a timeout mechanism for each of the `prepareFunc`, `commitFunc`, and `rollbackFunc` calls. If a participant doesn't respond within a reasonable time (e.g., 5 seconds), consider the operation a failure.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:** Although you don't need to *detect* deadlocks, think about how your design might contribute to or mitigate the risk of deadlocks in the participant services.  Document your design decisions related to deadlock prevention. A common approach is to enforce a global lock order.
*   **Logging:** Implement basic logging to track the progress of the transaction, including when each participant is prepared, committed, or rolled back.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty participant list.
*   Participants that are slow to respond or that fail intermittently.
*   Coordinator crashes during any phase of the transaction. (You don't need to implement crash recovery, but consider how your design would facilitate it).
*   Repeated calls to `ExecuteTransaction` with the same `transactionID`.  The coordinator should handle this gracefully, possibly by ignoring the duplicate request or by returning an error.

**Optimization:**

*   Minimize the overall transaction execution time by maximizing concurrency.
*   Avoid unnecessary retries.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the coordinator correctly implement the 2PC protocol, ensuring atomicity and consistency?
*   Concurrency:  Does the coordinator effectively use goroutines to maximize concurrency?
*   Error Handling:  Does the coordinator handle errors gracefully and attempt to complete the transaction even if some operations fail?
*   Timeout: Is the timeout mechanism implemented correctly?
*   Deadlock Consideration: Have you considered deadlock prevention in your design?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Efficiency: Is the code performant and avoids unnecessary overhead?
*   Handling Edge Cases: Does the code handle all the described edge cases?

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, error handling, and distributed systems concepts.  It also requires careful attention to detail to ensure that the 2PC protocol is implemented correctly and that the coordinator handles errors and timeouts gracefully. Good luck!

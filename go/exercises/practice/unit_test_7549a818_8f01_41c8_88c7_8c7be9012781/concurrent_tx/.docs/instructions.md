Okay, here's a challenging Go coding problem designed with the specified constraints in mind.

**Problem Title:** Concurrent Transaction Processing with Rollback

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified in-memory database system that supports concurrent transaction processing with rollback capabilities. The system manages a collection of accounts, each identified by a unique string ID and holding an integer balance.

**Functionality Requirements:**

1.  **Account Management:**
    *   `CreateAccount(accountID string, initialBalance int) error`: Creates a new account with the specified ID and initial balance. Returns an error if an account with the same ID already exists.
    *   `GetBalance(accountID string) (int, error)`: Retrieves the current balance of the specified account. Returns an error if the account does not exist.

2.  **Transaction Management:**
    *   `BeginTransaction() Transaction`: Starts a new transaction and returns a `Transaction` object.
    *   `Transaction` Interface: Represents an ongoing transaction. It should implement the following methods:
        *   `Deposit(accountID string, amount int) error`: Deposits the specified amount into the account within the transaction context. Returns an error if the account does not exist.  The amount can be negative.
        *   `Withdraw(accountID string, amount int) error`: Withdraws the specified amount from the account within the transaction context. Returns an error if the account does not exist or if the withdrawal would result in a negative balance (even temporarily within the transaction). The amount can be negative.
        *   `Commit() error`:  Applies all changes made within the transaction to the main account balances. Returns an error if there are any conflicts (e.g., another transaction committed changes to the same account concurrently).
        *   `Rollback() error`: Discards all changes made within the transaction, reverting the accounts to their state at the beginning of the transaction.

3.  **Concurrency:**
    *   The system must support multiple concurrent transactions.  Transactions should not block each other unless they are attempting to modify the same account.
    *   Account balances must remain consistent even under heavy concurrent load.  Prevent race conditions.

4.  **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID):**
    *   The system should strive to maintain ACID properties. While full durability is not expected for an in-memory database, atomicity, consistency, and isolation are critical.

**Constraints:**

*   **In-Memory:** The entire database must reside in memory. Data persistence is *not* required.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, returning specific errors for invalid operations (e.g., account not found, insufficient funds, concurrent modification).
*   **No External Libraries:** You are *not* allowed to use any external database libraries or transaction management frameworks.  You must implement the concurrency control mechanisms yourself. Standard Go libraries (e.g., `sync`, `context`) are allowed.
*   **Scalability:** While the database is in-memory, strive for a design that could potentially scale to a large number of accounts.  Avoid naive solutions that would become bottlenecks with increased data.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:** Implement your concurrency control mechanisms to avoid deadlocks.  This is a critical aspect of the problem.
*   **Optimization:** Focus on algorithmic efficiency. While micro-optimizations are not the primary goal, avoid obvious performance pitfalls. The faster, the better.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Concurrent transactions modifying the same account.
*   Transactions that depend on each other (e.g., transferring funds from one account to another within a single transaction).
*   Transactions that are rolled back after partial modifications.
*   Large numbers of accounts and transactions.
*   Accounts with very large balances.
*   Transactions with a high number of operations.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the system accurately process transactions and maintain account balances?
*   Concurrency: Does the system effectively handle concurrent transactions without race conditions or deadlocks?
*   Performance: How quickly does the system process transactions under load?
*   Error Handling: Does the system handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   ACID Properties: How well are atomicity, consistency, and isolation maintained?

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, data structures, and transaction management principles.  It's designed to be challenging and open-ended, allowing for multiple valid approaches with varying trade-offs in terms of performance, complexity, and scalability. Good luck!

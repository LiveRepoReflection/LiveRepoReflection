Okay, here's the problem description.

## Question: Scalable Service Orchestration

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable service orchestration system. This system manages a large number of microservices and their interdependencies. Each microservice performs a specific task, and complex operations require orchestrating multiple services in a specific order.

The system receives requests specifying a sequence of microservices that need to be executed in a specific order (a "workflow"). Each microservice invocation can have dependencies on the output of previous services in the workflow. The system needs to execute these workflows efficiently and reliably, handling a high volume of concurrent requests.

**Input:**

The system receives a stream of workflow requests. Each request is defined as follows:

*   `workflow_id`: A unique identifier for the workflow (string).
*   `services`: An ordered list of service names to execute (list of strings).
*   `dependencies`: A list of dependencies for each service. Each dependency is a mapping from a service in the workflow to a list of outputs from that service that the current service needs as input (list of dictionaries). For example: `dependencies = [{"service1": ["output1", "output2"]}, {"service2": ["output3"]}]` would mean the second service depends on "output1" and "output2" from "service1" and the third service depends on "output3" from "service2". The dependency list will always be the same length as the services list. If a service has no dependencies, its corresponding entry in the dependencies list will be an empty dictionary.

The services themselves are black boxes. You are given an API to call each service:

*   `ExecuteService(service_name string, input map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error)`: This function executes a service and returns its outputs as a map. The input map contains the necessary inputs for the service. If an error occurs, it returns an error.

**Output:**

For each workflow request, the system should return a map containing the outputs of each service in the workflow, keyed by the service name. If any service in the workflow fails, the entire workflow should be considered failed and an error should be returned instead of the output map. The system should return the results (or error) asynchronously.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent workflow requests (think thousands per second).
2.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to service failures. If a service fails, the system should retry the service a reasonable number of times (configurable). If the service continues to fail after retries, the entire workflow should be marked as failed.
3.  **Concurrency:** Services within a workflow should be executed concurrently as much as possible, respecting dependencies.  A service can only be executed after all its dependencies have been satisfied.
4.  **Efficiency:** Minimize the execution time of workflows.  Avoid unnecessary delays.
5.  **Idempotency:** You can assume each `workflow_id` only appears once in the input stream. You do not need to handle the situation where the same workflow is submitted multiple times.
6.  **Ordering:** The order of services in the `services` list must be strictly respected.
7.  **Service API:** You must use the provided `ExecuteService` API. You cannot modify the services themselves.
8. **Input Validation:** You can assume the input is well-formed, but you should handle edge cases like empty workflows or missing dependencies gracefully.

**Example:**

```go
// Sample Workflow Request
workflow_id := "workflow123"
services := []string{"serviceA", "serviceB", "serviceC"}
dependencies := []map[string][]string{
    {}, // serviceA has no dependencies
    {"serviceA": {"output1"}}, // serviceB depends on output1 from serviceA
    {"serviceA": {"output2"}, "serviceB": {"output3"}}, // serviceC depends on output2 from serviceA and output3 from serviceB
}
```

In this example, `serviceA` can be executed immediately. `serviceB` can only be executed after `serviceA` has completed and its `output1` is available. `serviceC` can only be executed after both `serviceA` and `serviceB` have completed and their respective outputs (`output2` and `output3`) are available.

**Considerations:**

*   How will you represent the dependencies between services?
*   How will you manage concurrent execution of services?
*   How will you handle service failures and retries?
*   How will you ensure the correct order of execution while maximizing concurrency?
*   What data structures will you use to efficiently store and access service outputs?
*   How will you handle a large volume of workflow requests without overloading the system?
*   What concurrency primitives (e.g., channels, mutexes, wait groups) will you use?
*   How can you test this system effectively, given the asynchronous nature and external service dependencies?

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, data structures, and distributed systems principles. Good luck!

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient network topology for a data center. The data center consists of `n` servers, and your goal is to connect them in a way that minimizes the average latency between any two servers while adhering to a strict budget constraint.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Servers:** The data center contains `n` servers, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.

2.  **Connections:** You can establish direct connections (edges) between servers. Each connection has a cost associated with it.

3.  **Latency:** The latency between two servers is defined as the shortest path (minimum number of hops) between them. If two servers are not reachable, the latency is defined as `infinity` (represented as a very large number like `n*n`).

4.  **Cost:**  Each connection between server `i` and server `j` has a cost `cost[i][j]`.  `cost[i][j]` is always equal to `cost[j][i]`. If there is no possible link `cost[i][j] == -1`. You cannot connect a server to itself so `cost[i][i] == -1`.

5.  **Budget:** You have a limited budget `B` to spend on establishing connections.

6.  **Objective:** Your task is to find a network topology (a set of connections) that minimizes the *average* latency between all pairs of servers, while ensuring that the total cost of the connections does not exceed the budget `B`.

7.  **Average Latency Calculation**: The average latency is calculated by summing the shortest path latencies between all distinct pairs of servers (i.e., from server `i` to server `j` where `i != j`) and dividing by the total number of distinct pairs (`n * (n - 1) / 2`).

**Input:**

*   `n` (int): The number of servers.
*   `cost` (\[][]int): A 2D array representing the cost of establishing a direct connection between any two servers. `cost[i][j]` is the cost of connecting server `i` and server `j`. A value of `-1` indicates that a direct connection is not possible.
*   `B` (int): The total budget for establishing connections.

**Output:**

Return a list of server pairs representing the edges in your designed network topology.
Each edge is a tuple (or slice of length 2) containing the server indices that are connected.
The order of the servers in a pair doesn't matter, i.e., `(i, j)` is the same as `(j, i)`. The order of edges in the list also does not matter.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 50`
*   `0 <= B <= 10000`
*   `0 <= cost[i][j] <= 1000` or `cost[i][j] == -1`
*   `cost[i][j] == cost[j][i]`
*   `cost[i][i] == -1`

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should aim to find a topology that minimizes the average latency. Due to the complexity of the problem, finding the absolute optimal solution might be computationally infeasible within a reasonable time limit. Your solution should strive for a near-optimal solution using efficient algorithms and heuristics.
*   The solution should be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size (`n = 50`) within the given time constraints (typically a few seconds).

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   The input graph may be disconnected initially.
*   The budget might be insufficient to connect all servers.
*   Adding a connection might increase the overall average latency (e.g., by creating longer paths).
*   Handle the case where it is impossible to connect all servers within the budget. In such cases, connect as many as possible while minimizing average latency.
*   Ensure the total cost of your selected connections does not exceed the budget `B`.
*   The latency between unconnected servers should be handled correctly in the average latency calculation. It is defined as infinity (represented as `n*n`).

This problem combines graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful handling of edge cases. A good solution will likely involve a combination of algorithms (e.g., shortest path algorithms, minimum spanning tree variants, heuristics for edge selection) and careful cost-benefit analysis for each potential connection.

Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated for a Java programming competition.

**Project Name:** `NetworkFlowOptimization`

**Question Description:**

A large-scale distributed system consists of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. These nodes communicate with each other through a network. The network is characterized by a set of unidirectional links. Each link connects two nodes and has a limited bandwidth capacity.

You are given the following information:

1.  `N`: The number of nodes in the network.
2.  `links`: A list of triplets, where each triplet `(u, v, capacity)` represents a unidirectional link from node `u` to node `v` with a bandwidth capacity of `capacity`.
3.  `source`: The source node (an integer between `0` and `N-1`).
4.  `sink`: The sink node (an integer between `0` and `N-1`).
5.  `demands`: A list of pairs, where each pair `(node, demand)` represents that a node requires a specific data volume.
6.  `supplies`: A list of pairs, where each pair `(node, supply)` represents that a node can generate a specific data volume.

Your goal is to implement an algorithm that determines the **maximum** data flow from the `source` to the `sink` such that all demands are met.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Meeting Demands:** The flow into each node must be great than or equal to its demand.
*   **Supplies:** The flow out of each node must be less than or equal to its supply.
*   **Capacity Constraints:** The flow through each link cannot exceed its capacity.
*   **Flow Conservation:** For every node (except the source and sink), the total flow entering the node must equal the total flow leaving the node.
*   **Maximization:** The total flow arriving at the sink node must be maximized.
*   `0 <= N <= 1000`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `0 <= capacity <= 1000`
*   The source and sink nodes are distinct.
*   Multiple links may exist between the same pair of nodes, but their capacities should be treated as separate.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   It is possible that no feasible flow exists to satisfy all demands and supply constraints. In this case, return -1.
*   The sum of the demands should be less than or equal to the sum of the supplies.

**Input:**

*   `N` (int): The number of nodes.
*   `links` (List\<int[]>): A list of links, where each link is represented as an array `[u, v, capacity]`.
*   `source` (int): The source node.
*   `sink` (int): The sink node.
*   `demands` (List\<int[]>): A list of demands, where each demand is represented as an array `[node, demand]`.
*   `supplies` (List\<int[]>): A list of supplies, where each supply is represented as an array `[node, supply]`.

**Output:**

*   (int): The maximum flow from the source to the sink, or -1 if no feasible flow exists.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle large networks (up to 1000 nodes) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider the algorithmic complexity of your approach.
*   Memory usage should also be considered. Avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

**Real-world Application:**

This problem models a common scenario in network optimization, such as maximizing data throughput in a data center network, optimizing resource allocation in a cloud computing environment, or designing efficient supply chains.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must produce the correct maximum flow for all valid inputs.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be efficient enough to handle large networks within a reasonable time limit.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

Good luck! This problem requires a deep understanding of network flow algorithms and careful attention to detail.

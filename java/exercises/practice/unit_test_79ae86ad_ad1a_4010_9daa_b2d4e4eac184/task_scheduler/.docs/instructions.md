Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Java coding problem:

## Project Name

`DistributedTaskScheduler`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed task scheduler.  Imagine a system where numerous worker nodes are available to execute tasks, and a central scheduler is responsible for assigning these tasks to the workers in an optimal manner.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Task Representation:**  Each task is represented by a `Task` object, containing a unique `taskId` (String), a `priority` (integer, lower value indicates higher priority), an `estimatedExecutionTime` (long, in milliseconds), and a `resourceRequirements` map (String -> Integer, representing the amount of each resource type required by the task, e.g. "CPU" -> 2, "Memory" -> 4).

2.  **Worker Node Representation:** Each worker node is represented by a `WorkerNode` object.  It has a unique `nodeId` (String), a `resourceCapacity` map (String -> Integer, representing the total amount of each resource type the node possesses), and a `currentResourceAllocation` map (String -> Integer, tracking currently allocated resources).

3.  **Scheduler Functionality:**
    *   **Task Submission:**  The scheduler receives tasks to be executed. Tasks can arrive at any time.
    *   **Task Assignment:**  The scheduler must assign tasks to available worker nodes. The assignment should consider task priority, resource requirements, and node capacity. A task can only be assigned to a node if the node has sufficient available resources (resourceCapacity - currentResourceAllocation >= resourceRequirements for all resource types).
    *   **Optimal Task Placement:** The scheduler must strive to optimize task placement based on the following criteria, in order of importance:
        1.  **Meet Task Deadline:** Each task has a deadline, which is implicitly calculated based on `estimatedExecutionTime` and the time of task submission (arrivalTime + estimatedExecutionTime). Tasks must be completed before their deadline. If a task cannot be completed before its deadline on any available node, it should be rejected.
        2.  **Resource Utilization:** Maximize the overall resource utilization across all worker nodes. The scheduler should avoid leaving nodes underutilized if possible.
        3. **Fairness:** Ensure that all worker nodes receive a fair share of tasks based on their resource capacity. Avoid overloading some nodes while leaving others idle.

    *   **Task Completion and Resource Release:** When a worker node finishes executing a task, it notifies the scheduler. The scheduler must then release the resources allocated to that task on the worker node.
    *   **Task Cancellation:** The scheduler should be able to cancel tasks that are waiting to be scheduled.
    *   **Scalability:** The scheduler should be designed to handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes.
    *   **Concurrency:** The scheduler must be thread-safe to handle concurrent task submissions and worker node updates.

4.  **Dynamic Node Updates:** Worker nodes can dynamically join or leave the system. The scheduler must be able to handle these changes gracefully and re-evaluate task assignments accordingly.  When a node leaves, any running or scheduled tasks on that node are considered failed and should be rescheduled (if possible).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of worker nodes can vary significantly (from a few to thousands).
*   The number of tasks can be very large.
*   Resource types are strings, and the number of distinct resource types is relatively small (less than 100).
*   The scheduler should respond reasonably quickly to task submissions and node updates.  Avoid blocking operations that could significantly delay the scheduler.
*   You are free to choose appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   You should consider the trade-offs between different scheduling strategies (e.g., greedy, best-fit, etc.).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The scheduler must correctly assign tasks to worker nodes, respecting resource constraints and task deadlines.
*   Efficiency: The scheduler should efficiently utilize available resources and minimize task completion times.
*   Scalability: The scheduler should be able to handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes.
*   Robustness: The scheduler should be resilient to failures and handle dynamic node updates gracefully.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Consider edge cases and handle them properly (e.g. no available nodes, task resource requirements exceeding maximum node capacity).

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems concepts. Optimizing the scheduling algorithm for efficiency and scalability is the key challenge. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to test a range of skills, including data structures, algorithms, and optimization.

**Problem Title: Efficient Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient task scheduling system for a complex project. The project consists of `N` tasks, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `duration[i]`: The time (in minutes) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline[i]`: The latest time (in minutes from the project start) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start.  This represents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where tasks are nodes and dependencies are edges.

Your system needs to determine a schedule that minimizes the *maximum lateness* of any task. The lateness of a task is defined as `max(0, completion_time - deadline[i])`.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks (1 <= N <= 100,000).
*   `duration`: An array of N integers representing the duration of each task (1 <= duration[i] <= 10,000).
*   `deadline`: An array of N integers representing the deadline of each task (1 <= deadline[i] <= 1,000,000,000).
*   `dependencies`: A list of N lists of integers, where `dependencies[i]` represents the tasks that must be completed before task `i` can start.  It is guaranteed that the dependency graph is a DAG.

**Output:**

Return the minimum possible maximum lateness across all tasks, achievable by a valid schedule. If it is impossible to complete all tasks within their deadlines, return -1.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Input:** The number of tasks can be quite large, so your solution must be efficient.  Naive approaches will likely time out.
*   **DAG:** The task dependencies form a directed acyclic graph.  This means there are no cycles in the dependencies, and a topological ordering exists.
*   **Optimization:** The goal is to *minimize the maximum lateness*, not simply find *a* valid schedule.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider cases where the dependency graph is empty (no dependencies), or where some tasks have very tight deadlines.
*   **Time Limit:** The solution should execute within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 seconds).
*   **Memory Limit:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially with large input sizes.

**Example:**

```
N = 3
duration = [2, 3, 2]
deadline = [6, 8, 12]
dependencies = [[], [0], [1]]

```

In this example:

*   Task 0 has duration 2, deadline 6, and no dependencies.
*   Task 1 has duration 3, deadline 8, and depends on Task 0.
*   Task 2 has duration 2, deadline 12, and depends on Task 1.

A possible schedule is:

1.  Task 0: Starts at 0, completes at 2.
2.  Task 1: Starts at 2, completes at 5.
3.  Task 2: Starts at 5, completes at 7.

Lateness:

*   Task 0: max(0, 2 - 6) = 0
*   Task 1: max(0, 5 - 8) = 0
*   Task 2: max(0, 7 - 12) = 0

Maximum lateness: 0

Another possible schedule could have worse lateness values. Your solution must find the *minimum* possible maximum lateness.

**Hint:** Think about topological sorting, scheduling algorithms, and how to efficiently explore possible schedules while avoiding brute-force approaches. Consider binary search on the maximum lateness.

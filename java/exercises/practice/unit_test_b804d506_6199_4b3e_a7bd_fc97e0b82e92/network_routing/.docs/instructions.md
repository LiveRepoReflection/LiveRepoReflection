Okay, here is a challenging Java coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithm optimization, and handling complex constraints, similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

## Question Description

You are designing a next-generation network routing protocol for a large-scale distributed system. The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Each node represents a server, and the connections between servers form a complex, potentially dynamic network.

The network's topology is represented by a list of unidirectional connections, where each connection is a tuple `(u, v, latency)`, indicating a directed connection from node `u` to node `v` with an associated network latency.  The latency is a positive integer representing the time it takes for a packet to travel from `u` to `v`.  Multiple connections can exist between the same pair of nodes, potentially with differing latencies. Furthermore, the network is not guaranteed to be fully connected.

Your task is to implement an efficient algorithm that allows for querying the **k-th smallest latency** path between any two nodes `start` and `end` in the network.  A path's latency is the sum of the latencies of all connections along the path.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Dynamic Updates:** The network topology can change over time. You need to support the following operations:
    *   `addConnection(u, v, latency)`: Adds a new unidirectional connection from node `u` to node `v` with the given latency.
    *   `removeConnection(u, v, latency)`: Removes a specific connection from node `u` to node `v` with the given latency. If the specific connection does not exist, nothing happens. If multiple identical connections exist (same u, v, latency), remove only one.
    *   The add and remove connection operations should be efficient.

2.  **K-th Smallest Path Query:**  Implement the function `findKthSmallestPath(start, end, k)` which returns the latency of the k-th smallest latency path from node `start` to node `end`. Assume that paths can contain cycles.

3.  **Constraints:**

    *   `1 <= n <= 1000` (Number of nodes)
    *   `1 <= latency <= 100` (Latency of a single connection)
    *   The number of connections will not exceed 10000 at any given time.
    *   `1 <= k <= 100` (k-th smallest path to find)
    *   `0 <= start, end < n` (Valid node indices)
    *   `start` and `end` can be the same node.
    *   If there are fewer than `k` distinct paths between `start` and `end`, return `-1`.
    *   Multiple paths can have the same latency. When ordering paths, consider paths with the same latency to be distinct. For example, if you need to find the 2nd smallest path and both the 1st and 2nd smallest path have the same latency, you still return the latency of the 2nd smallest path (not the 3rd).

4.  **Performance:** The `findKthSmallestPath` function should be optimized for query performance. Pre-computation is allowed and encouraged, but should not dominate the overall runtime, especially for small values of `k`.  Adding and removing connections should be reasonably efficient and should not trigger a complete recomputation unless absolutely necessary.  Consider memory usage.

5.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases such as no path existing between `start` and `end`, negative cycles (though this is not explicitly stated, good solutions will avoid infinite loops caused by negative cycles), and disconnected graphs.  Your solution should not crash or enter an infinite loop in these scenarios.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithms to balance the trade-offs between query speed and update efficiency. Good luck!

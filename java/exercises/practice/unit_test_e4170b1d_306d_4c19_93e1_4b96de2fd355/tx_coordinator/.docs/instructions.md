Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard level, incorporating the requested elements.

**Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator for a system of multiple microservices.  Imagine these microservices are responsible for managing different aspects of an e-commerce platform: inventory, user accounts, order processing, and payment.  To ensure data consistency across these services, transactions that span multiple services must be atomic (either all operations succeed, or none).

Your coordinator must handle two-phase commit (2PC) transactions across these services. Each microservice exposes a simplified interface:

*   **`prepare(transactionId)`:**  The service attempts to prepare for the transaction.  It reserves the necessary resources and validates that it *can* commit the transaction.  It returns `true` if it's prepared, `false` otherwise.  Preparation might fail due to insufficient resources, invalid data, or other service-specific reasons.
*   **`commit(transactionId)`:** The service permanently applies the changes associated with the transaction.  This method is only called *after* `prepare()` has succeeded.
*   **`rollback(transactionId)`:** The service undoes any changes made during the preparation phase. This method is called if any service fails to prepare or if the coordinator decides to abort the transaction.

Your coordinator needs to implement the following functionality:

1.  **`begin()`:** Starts a new transaction, assigning it a unique transaction ID.
2.  **`enlist(service, operation)`:** Registers a service and a specific operation (a `Callable<Boolean>`) to be performed within the transaction.  The `operation` represents the action the service will take during the transaction.
3.  **`commit()`:** Attempts to commit the current transaction using the 2PC protocol.
4.  **`rollback()`:** Rolls back the current transaction.
5.  **`getStatus()`:** Returns the status of the transaction (e.g., `ACTIVE`, `PREPARING`, `COMMITTED`, `ABORTED`).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:**  The coordinator must be thread-safe and handle multiple concurrent transactions.
*   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for the `prepare` phase. If a service doesn't respond within a reasonable time (e.g., configurable via a constructor parameter), the coordinator should assume it failed to prepare and abort the transaction.
*   **Idempotency:**  Services may receive `commit` or `rollback` requests multiple times. Your coordinator should not assume that the services are inherently idempotent; therefore, design your coordinator to minimize the chances of sending duplicate requests, but handle them gracefully if they occur.  The services themselves are *not* required to be idempotent for this problem.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle network errors, service unavailability, and other potential exceptions gracefully. Log errors appropriately.
*   **Optimization:** Minimize the time it takes to complete a transaction, especially during the `prepare` and `commit` phases. Consider using asynchronous operations where appropriate.
*   **Scalability Considerations:** While this is an in-memory implementation, think about how your design could be adapted to a distributed environment where the coordinator itself might be replicated. What challenges would arise? (This doesn't require a fully distributed implementation, but thoughtful comments in the code are appreciated).
*   **Resource Management:**  Ensure resources (threads, connections, etc.) are properly released after a transaction completes, regardless of whether it commits or rolls back.
*   **Transaction Isolation:** Ensure that each transaction is independent of all others.

**Input:**

*   The `enlist` method takes a `service` object, which represents a microservice.  You can define an interface for the service with `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods.
*   The `enlist` method also takes a `Callable<Boolean>` object, which represents the operation to be performed by the service.

**Output:**

*   The `commit()` method should return `true` if the transaction committed successfully, and `false` otherwise.
*   The `getStatus()` method should return an enum representing the transaction's state.

**Example Interaction:**

```java
// Assume InventoryService, AccountService, OrderService, PaymentService are implemented.
TransactionCoordinator coordinator = new TransactionCoordinator();

String transactionId = coordinator.begin();

coordinator.enlist(inventoryService, () -> inventoryService.prepare(transactionId));
coordinator.enlist(accountService, () -> accountService.prepare(transactionId));
coordinator.enlist(orderService, () -> orderService.prepare(transactionId));
coordinator.enlist(paymentService, () -> paymentService.prepare(transactionId));

boolean committed = coordinator.commit();

if (committed) {
  // Success!
} else {
  // Handle failure.
}
```

**Hints:**

*   Use a state machine to track the transaction's lifecycle.
*   Consider using an `ExecutorService` for asynchronous execution of `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` operations.
*   Think carefully about exception handling and how to ensure that all services are either committed or rolled back, even in the face of failures.
*   Explore data structures that provide thread safety such as `ConcurrentHashMap` or `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, distributed systems concepts, and error handling. Good luck!

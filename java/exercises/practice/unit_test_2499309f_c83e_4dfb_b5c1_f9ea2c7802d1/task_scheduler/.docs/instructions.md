Okay, here is a challenging Java coding problem, designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

## Question: Distributed Task Scheduler with Resource Constraints

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed task scheduler for a large-scale data processing system. The system consists of a cluster of machines, each with a limited amount of resources (CPU cores, memory, and disk space).  A set of independent tasks needs to be scheduled and executed on these machines. Each task requires a specific amount of each resource to run. The goal is to minimize the makespan (the time when the last task finishes execution) while respecting the resource constraints of each machine and task dependencies. Tasks are independent so the order does not matter.

**Input:**

*   `machines`: A list of `Machine` objects, where each `Machine` has attributes:
    *   `id` (String): Unique identifier for the machine.
    *   `cpuCores` (int): Number of CPU cores available.
    *   `memory` (long): Amount of memory available in bytes.
    *   `diskSpace` (long): Amount of disk space available in bytes.
*   `tasks`: A list of `Task` objects, where each `Task` has attributes:
    *   `id` (String): Unique identifier for the task.
    *   `cpuCoresRequired` (int): Number of CPU cores required.
    *   `memoryRequired` (long): Amount of memory required in bytes.
    *   `diskSpaceRequired` (long): Amount of disk space required in bytes.
    *   `estimatedRunTime` (long): Estimated run time of the task in milliseconds.
*   `maxConcurrentTasksPerMachine` (int): limits concurrent tasks on a given machine.

**Output:**

A `List<ScheduledTask>`, each representing a task scheduled to run on a specific machine, along with its start time. Also you need to return the makespan.

*   `ScheduledTask`: A class/record with:
    *   `taskId` (String): The ID of the task.
    *   `machineId` (String): The ID of the machine it is scheduled on.
    *   `startTime` (long): The start time of the task (in milliseconds, relative to the start of the scheduling process, i.e., time 0).

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Resource Constraints:**  A task can only be scheduled on a machine if the machine has sufficient available resources (CPU, memory, and disk) *at the time the task starts*. Resources are released only when the task completes.
*   **No Preemption:**  Once a task starts running on a machine, it cannot be moved to another machine or interrupted.
*   **Task Dependencies:** N/A - Tasks are independent and can be scheduled in any order.
*   **Machine Availability:** Assume all machines are available from time 0.
*   **Optimal Scheduling:** The goal is to minimize the makespan, but finding a provably optimal solution might be computationally infeasible for large inputs. Aim for a reasonably good solution using heuristics.
*   **Large Input Sizes:** The number of machines and tasks can be very large (e.g., thousands or tens of thousands). The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle these sizes.
*   **Integer Overflow:** Be mindful of potential integer overflows when calculating resource usage and time. Use `long` where appropriate.
*   **Resource Fragmentation:**  The scheduler needs to efficiently handle resource fragmentation.  For example, even if a machine has enough total memory, if it's fragmented into smaller chunks, a large task might not be able to run.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Time Complexity:**  The solution should strive for the best possible time complexity, given the NP-hard nature of the problem. Solutions with exponential complexity will likely time out for larger inputs.
*   **Space Complexity:**  Minimize memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of tasks and machines.

**Real-World Considerations:**

*   This problem models a simplified version of task scheduling in cloud computing environments.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

Several approaches can be used to solve this problem, including:

*   **Greedy Algorithms:** Schedule tasks in some order based on heuristics (e.g., shortest task first, longest task first, most resource-intensive task first) to the machine with the earliest available time and sufficient resources.
*   **Simulated Annealing/Genetic Algorithms:**  Use metaheuristic optimization techniques to explore the solution space.
*   **Constraint Programming/Integer Programming:** Formulate the problem as a constraint satisfaction or integer programming problem and use a solver to find a solution (though this might be too slow for large inputs).

**Example:**

```java
class Machine {
    String id;
    int cpuCores;
    long memory;
    long diskSpace;
}

class Task {
    String id;
    int cpuCoresRequired;
    long memoryRequired;
    long diskSpaceRequired;
    long estimatedRunTime;
}

class ScheduledTask {
    String taskId;
    String machineId;
    long startTime;
}

List<ScheduledTask> scheduleTasks(List<Machine> machines, List<Task> tasks, int maxConcurrentTasksPerMachine) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Good luck! This is designed to be quite challenging!

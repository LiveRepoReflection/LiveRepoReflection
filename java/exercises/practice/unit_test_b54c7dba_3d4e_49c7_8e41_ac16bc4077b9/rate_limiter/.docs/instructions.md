## Project Name

`DistributedRateLimiter`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service. This service will be used to protect critical APIs from abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specific time window. The service needs to be highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a popular e-commerce platform. You have several APIs that allow users to search for products, add items to their cart, and place orders. To prevent malicious users from overwhelming your system with excessive requests, you need to implement a rate limiter.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Environment:** The rate limiter must work correctly across multiple servers or instances. Clients should be rate-limited regardless of which server they hit.

2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The service must support different rate limits for different clients (identified by a unique ID, such as an API key or user ID) and different API endpoints. The rate limit should be defined as the maximum number of requests allowed within a given time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).

3.  **Atomic Operations:** The rate limiting logic must be atomic to prevent race conditions when multiple requests from the same client arrive concurrently.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should gracefully handle failures of individual servers or components. Data consistency should be maintained even in the face of network partitions or server crashes.

5.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter must be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests and scale horizontally as the platform grows.

6.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter should be efficient in terms of latency and resource usage. The time taken to check and increment the request count should be minimal to avoid impacting API response times.

7.  **Dynamic Configuration:**  The rate limits for different clients and API endpoints should be dynamically configurable without requiring a service restart.

8.  **Time-Based Expiration:** The request counts should automatically expire after the time window has elapsed.

9. **Throttling Response:** When a client exceeds their rate limit, the service should return a standard HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" error.  This response should also include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long the client should wait before making another request.

**Constraints:**

*   You must use a distributed cache or data store (e.g., Redis, Memcached, Cassandra, or a similar technology) to store request counts and ensure consistency across all servers.
*   You must handle concurrency issues correctly to prevent over-counting requests.
*   You should consider the impact of network latency and potential data inconsistencies on the accuracy of the rate limiting.
*   You should aim to minimize the overhead of the rate limiting logic to avoid negatively impacting API performance.
* You are responsible for picking the right algorithm and data structure to manage the rate limit.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a sliding window rate limiter for more accurate rate limiting.
*   Provide a mechanism for monitoring and alerting on rate limiting events (e.g., when clients are being throttled).
*   Implement a burst allowance mechanism to allow clients to exceed their rate limit temporarily.

Good luck! This is a challenging problem that requires careful consideration of system design principles and distributed systems concepts.

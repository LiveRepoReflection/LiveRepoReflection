Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed with the elements you requested.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a system involving multiple independent microservices. These microservices need to perform atomic operations that span across their respective databases.  Think of a scenario where transferring funds from one bank account to another requires updates in two different banking microservices.

Your coordinator must guarantee ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for these cross-service transactions using a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Microservice Simulation:** You'll be provided with an interface (`Microservice`) that represents a simplified microservice. Each microservice has a `prepare(TransactionContext)` and `commit(TransactionContext)`/`rollback(TransactionContext)` method. Assume these methods interact with a local database within the microservice, performing some operation related to the transaction. The `prepare` method checks if the microservice *can* commit the transaction and returns true/false accordingly.
2.  **Transaction Context:** Implement a `TransactionContext` class to hold transaction-specific data (e.g., transaction ID, data relevant to the operation). This context needs to be serializable for communication between the coordinator and microservices.
3.  **Coordinator Logic:** Implement the `TransactionCoordinator` class with the following core functionalities:
    *   `begin()`: Starts a new transaction and generates a unique transaction ID.
    *   `enlist(Microservice)`: Registers a microservice to participate in the current transaction.
    *   `prepareTransaction(TransactionContext)`: Implements the first phase of the 2PC protocol. It iterates through all enlisted microservices and calls their `prepare()` methods. If *any* microservice fails to prepare (returns `false` or throws an exception), the entire transaction must be aborted.
    *   `commitTransaction(TransactionContext)`: Implements the second phase of the 2PC protocol. If `prepareTransaction` succeeded, it iterates through all enlisted microservices and calls their `commit()` methods.
    *   `rollbackTransaction(TransactionContext)`: Implements the rollback phase. If `prepareTransaction` failed, it iterates through all enlisted microservices and calls their `rollback()` methods.
4.  **Failure Handling:**  Your coordinator must handle potential failures gracefully. This includes:
    *   **Microservice Unavailability:**  Simulate microservice failures (e.g., network errors, crashes) using `try-catch` blocks and appropriate exception handling. If a microservice is unavailable during prepare, commit or rollback, the coordinator must retry a certain number of times (configurable).  After the retry limit is reached, the coordinator should log the failure and continue with other microservices.  The transaction should be considered "partially failed" in this scenario, requiring manual intervention to resolve inconsistencies.
    *   **Idempotency:** Ensure that the `commit()` and `rollback()` operations on the microservices are idempotent. This means that if a commit/rollback message is resent (due to a network error, for example), the microservice can handle it without causing unintended side effects.
5.  **Concurrency:**  The coordinator must handle concurrent transactions correctly. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks) to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.
6.  **Logging:**  Implement basic logging to track the progress of transactions (begin, prepare, commit, rollback, failures).
7.  **Optimizations:**
    *   **Asynchronous Communication:**  Implement the `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` phases using asynchronous communication (e.g., using `ExecutorService`) to improve performance.
    *   **Optimistic Locking:** Introduce optimistic locking within the microservices to avoid unnecessary locking during the `prepare` phase. This can be simulated by checking a version number or timestamp before committing changes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of enlisted microservices can be up to 100.
*   The maximum retry attempts for a failed microservice is configurable (e.g., 3-5 attempts).
*   Transaction execution time should be minimized.
*   The system must be resilient to intermittent microservice failures.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The implementation must correctly guarantee ACID properties for distributed transactions.
*   Robustness: The implementation must handle various failure scenarios gracefully.
*   Performance: The implementation must be efficient and minimize transaction execution time.
*   Code Quality: The code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   Concurrency Handling: The implementation must correctly handle concurrent transactions.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, transaction management, concurrency, and error handling. It also challenges the solver to think about optimization techniques to improve performance and resilience. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level, focusing on algorithmic efficiency, system design considerations, and real-world applicability.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a scenario where multiple microservices need to participate in a single atomic transaction.  A failure in any one microservice requires a rollback of all operations across all participating services.

Your DTC should manage transactions across `N` microservices. Each microservice exposes a simplified API:

*   `prepare(transactionId)`:  The DTC calls this on each microservice to check if it *can* commit the transaction.  The microservice performs necessary checks (e.g., resource availability, data validation) and returns `true` if it's ready to commit, `false` otherwise.  A microservice might also throw an exception (e.g., `TimeoutException`, `ServiceUnavailableException`) indicating a temporary failure.
*   `commit(transactionId)`:  The DTC calls this on each microservice *after* all microservices have successfully prepared.  The microservice persists the changes associated with the transaction.
*   `rollback(transactionId)`: The DTC calls this on each microservice if any microservice fails to prepare or if the DTC itself encounters an error. The microservice undoes any changes made during the transaction.

The DTC itself must expose the following API:

*   `begin()`:  Starts a new transaction and returns a unique `transactionId` (a `UUID` is recommended).
*   `enlist(transactionId, service)`:  Adds a microservice (represented by a `Service` interface - see below) to the transaction identified by `transactionId`.
*   `commit(transactionId)`:  Attempts to commit the transaction.  This method must orchestrate the `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` calls on the enlisted microservices.  It should return `true` if the transaction committed successfully, `false` otherwise.
*   `rollback(transactionId)`:  Forces a rollback of the transaction.  This is typically called if the `commit` method fails.

Here's the `Service` interface that represents an external microservice:

```java
interface Service {
    boolean prepare(UUID transactionId) throws Exception; // Could throw exceptions
    void commit(UUID transactionId) throws Exception; // Could throw exceptions
    void rollback(UUID transactionId) throws Exception; // Could throw exceptions
}
```

**Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Atomicity:** The transaction must be atomic. Either all microservices commit successfully, or all must rollback.
2.  **Concurrency:**  The DTC must support concurrent transactions. Multiple clients might request to begin, enlist, commit, or rollback transactions simultaneously.  Ensure thread safety.
3.  **Idempotency:**  The `commit` and `rollback` methods on the microservices *might* be called multiple times.  The microservices must be designed to handle this (i.e., they must be idempotent). Your DTC doesn't have to enforce idempotency, but the design must allow for it.
4.  **Timeout Handling:**  The `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` operations on the microservices might timeout (represented by a `TimeoutException`). The DTC must handle timeouts gracefully. If a `prepare` call times out, the transaction must be rolled back. If a `commit` or `rollback` call times out, the DTC should retry the operation a reasonable number of times before giving up and logging an error.
5.  **Service Unavailability:** The `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` operations on the microservices might throw `ServiceUnavailableException`. The DTC must handle the exceptions gracefully. If a `prepare` call fails due to service unavailability, the transaction must be rolled back. If a `commit` or `rollback` call fails due to service unavailability, the DTC should retry the operation a reasonable number of times before giving up and logging an error.
6.  **Logging:**  The DTC should log significant events, such as transaction begin, enlist, prepare success/failure, commit success/failure, and rollback success/failure. Use a standard logging framework (e.g., `java.util.logging`, Log4j, SLF4J).
7.  **Resource Management:** The DTC should release resources (e.g., threads, connections) promptly after a transaction completes (either successfully or with an error).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Does the DTC correctly implement the atomicity property?
*   **Concurrency:**  Does the DTC handle concurrent transactions correctly and efficiently?
*   **Error Handling:**  Does the DTC handle timeouts and service unavailability gracefully?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Efficiency:**  Is the DTC designed to minimize latency and resource consumption?
*   **Testability:** Is the DTC designed in a way that it can be easily tested?

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a state machine to track the state of each transaction.
*   Use appropriate data structures to store transaction metadata and enlisted services.
*   Use concurrency utilities (e.g., `ExecutorService`, `Future`, `Lock`) to manage concurrent operations.
*   Think about how to handle partial failures during commit and rollback.
*   Design your solution with modularity and extensibility in mind. This will allow you to add new features and improve performance more easily in the future.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling in Java.  Good luck!

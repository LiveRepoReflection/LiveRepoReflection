Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithms, and optimization skills.

## Question: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for a simplified banking system. The system consists of multiple independent bank branches (represented as servers), each managing a subset of customer accounts.  Your coordinator must ensure the Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties for transactions that involve accounts across different branches.

Specifically, you need to implement a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol to handle distributed transactions.

**System Architecture:**

*   **Transaction Coordinator:** The central service that initiates and manages distributed transactions.
*   **Bank Branches (Participants):** Independent servers that manage customer accounts and participate in distributed transactions.

**Transaction Model:**

A transaction involves transferring funds from one account to another. Accounts are identified by a unique `accountId` (String). The `accountId` contains the bank branch information. For simplicity, assume each transaction involves only two accounts. All transactions are initiated by the Transaction Coordinator.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Implement the 2PC Protocol:**  Your coordinator must implement the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity. This involves the following steps:
    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):**
        *   The coordinator sends a "prepare" message to all participating branches (those that hold the `accountIds` involved in the transaction).
        *   Each branch attempts to tentatively perform its part of the transaction (e.g., debiting or crediting the account).
        *   If successful, the branch replies with a "vote-commit" message. If the branch cannot perform its part (e.g., insufficient funds, account doesn't exist, internal error), it replies with a "vote-abort" message.  The branch must record its prepared state durably.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Abort Phase):**
        *   If the coordinator receives "vote-commit" from *all* participating branches, it sends a "commit" message to all branches.
        *   If the coordinator receives even one "vote-abort" message, or if any branch fails to respond within a specified timeout, it sends an "abort" message to all branches.
        *   Upon receiving a "commit" message, each branch permanently applies the transaction changes. Upon receiving an "abort" message, each branch rolls back any tentative changes.  The branch must record its committed or aborted state durably.

2.  **Concurrency Control:**  Implement appropriate locking mechanisms at the branch level to ensure isolation between concurrent transactions involving the same accounts. You can assume a pessimistic locking strategy.

3.  **Failure Handling:**  Consider the following failure scenarios and implement recovery mechanisms:
    *   **Coordinator Failure:** If the coordinator fails during the prepare or commit/abort phase, participating branches should be able to recover the transaction state upon coordinator restart. Implement a durable log for the coordinator to track the state of each transaction.
    *   **Branch Failure:** If a branch fails after voting to commit but before receiving the commit message, it should be able to recover and complete the transaction upon restart.  Similarly, if a branch fails after voting to abort, it should be able to recover and rollback the transaction.
    *   **Network Partitions:** Consider the impact of network partitions and implement reasonable strategies to handle them (e.g., using timeouts, retry mechanisms, or a designated recovery procedure).

4.  **Optimization:**  Design your solution to minimize latency and maximize throughput.  Consider techniques such as:
    *   Optimizing the message exchange between the coordinator and branches.
    *   Minimizing the duration of locks held on account balances.
    *   Implementing efficient logging mechanisms.

5.  **Constraints:**
    *   Implement the solution in Java.
    *   Simulate the bank branches using in-memory data structures (e.g., `HashMap`) for account balances. Do not use a real database for the branches.
    *   Assume a maximum of 10 bank branches.
    *   Assume a maximum of 1000 accounts per branch.
    *   Implement a configurable timeout for branch responses.
    *   The transaction must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable even when the coordinator or branch might fail.
    *   The solution should consider a real world scenario.

6.  **Scalability**
    *   The solution should be scalable to large numbers of branches and transactions.
    *   The solution must support concurrent transactions.

**Input:**

The input consists of a series of transaction requests. Each request specifies:

*   `sourceAccountId` (String): The account to debit.
*   `destinationAccountId` (String): The account to credit.
*   `amount` (double): The amount to transfer.
*   `transactionId` (String): The unique identifier for the transaction.

**Output:**

For each transaction request, your coordinator should output:

*   `TransactionId: SUCCESS` if the transaction completes successfully.
*   `TransactionId: FAILURE` if the transaction fails.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Ensuring ACID properties are maintained under various scenarios, including failures.
*   **Performance:**  Minimizing transaction latency and maximizing throughput.
*   **Code Quality:**  Adhering to good coding practices, including modularity, readability, and maintainability.
*   **Failure Handling:**  Robustness in handling coordinator and branch failures.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and failure handling techniques.  Good luck!

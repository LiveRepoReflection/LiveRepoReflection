Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem:

**Problem Title:  Optimal Meeting Point**

**Problem Description:**

Imagine a large city represented as a weighted, undirected graph.  Each node in the graph represents a location, and each edge represents a road connecting two locations, with the weight of the edge representing the time it takes to travel between those locations.

`K` individuals are scattered throughout this city.  Each individual is located at a specific node in the graph. They want to choose a single meeting point (one of the nodes in the graph) that minimizes the *maximum* travel time any individual has to spend to reach the meeting point.

Formally, let:

*   `G = (V, E)` be the weighted, undirected graph representing the city, where `V` is the set of nodes (locations) and `E` is the set of edges (roads).
*   `w(u, v)` be the weight (travel time) of the edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
*   `locations = [l1, l2, ..., lK]` be an array representing the starting locations of the `K` individuals, where `li` is a node in `V`.
*   `distance(u, v)` be the shortest path distance (minimum travel time) between nodes `u` and `v` in the graph `G`.

The goal is to find a meeting point `m` in `V` such that:

`m = argmin_v (max_i distance(li, v))`

In other words, find the node `m` that minimizes the maximum travel time from any individual's starting location `li` to the meeting point `v`.

**Input:**

Your function will receive the following inputs:

1.  `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the graph (nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1). `1 <= n <= 200`
2.  `edges`: A 2D integer array representing the edges of the graph. Each row `edges[i]` represents an edge: `[u, v, weight]`, where `u` and `v` are the node indices (0-indexed) connected by the edge, and `weight` is the travel time (a positive integer) along that edge.  It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between any two nodes. `1 <= weight <= 1000`
3.  `locations`: An integer array representing the starting locations of the K individuals.  Each element in `locations` is a valid node index (0 to n-1). `1 <= K <= n`

**Output:**

Your function should return an integer representing the index of the optimal meeting point (a node in the graph) that minimizes the maximum travel time from any individual to the meeting point.  If there are multiple optimal meeting points, return the one with the smallest index.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Graph Structure:** The graph may not be fully connected.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Handle cases where individuals are already at the optimal meeting point (distance is 0).
*   **Efficiency:** The solution needs to be efficient enough to handle graphs with up to 200 nodes and a reasonable number of edges. Inefficient solutions (e.g., repeatedly calculating shortest paths for every possible meeting point) may time out.
*   **Integer Overflow:**  Be mindful of potential integer overflow when calculating distances, especially if the graph is dense and edge weights are large.
*   **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If multiple nodes satisfy the minimizing criteria, return the node with the smallest index.

**Example:**

```
n = 4
edges = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 5], [1, 2, 2], [1, 3, 1]]
locations = [0, 3]

Output: 1

Explanation:
- Meeting at node 0: max(distance(0,0), distance(3,0)) = max(0, 2) = 2
- Meeting at node 1: max(distance(0,1), distance(3,1)) = max(1, 1) = 1
- Meeting at node 2: max(distance(0,2), distance(3,2)) = max(5, 2) = 5
- Meeting at node 3: max(distance(0,3), distance(3,3)) = max(2, 0) = 2

Node 1 minimizes the maximum distance (1).
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, shortest path algorithms, and optimization techniques.  Good luck!

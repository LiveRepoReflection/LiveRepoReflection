Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be at LeetCode Hard difficulty.

**Project Name:** `ScalableTrafficControl`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a scalable traffic control system for a large, dynamic city.  The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are intersections and edges are roads connecting them. Each road has a capacity, representing the maximum number of vehicles that can traverse it per minute.

The city also has a set of source-destination pairs, each with a traffic demand (vehicles per minute) that needs to be routed through the network.  Your system must efficiently route traffic to minimize overall congestion.

However, the traffic demands and road capacities change dynamically over time. Your system must adapt quickly to these changes to maintain optimal traffic flow.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** Implement a suitable data structure to represent the city's road network. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and query performance.

2.  **Traffic Routing:** Implement a traffic routing algorithm that can handle multiple source-destination pairs simultaneously. The algorithm should aim to satisfy the traffic demand for each pair while respecting road capacities.  You can use techniques like Maximum Flow, or approximation algorithms if the constraints are too strict.

3.  **Dynamic Updates:** Implement a mechanism to handle dynamic updates to the road network and traffic demands.  Updates include:
    *   Changing the capacity of a road.
    *   Adding or removing a road.
    *   Changing the traffic demand for a source-destination pair.
    *   Adding or removing a source-destination pair.

4.  **Congestion Metric:** Define a congestion metric to evaluate the overall performance of the traffic routing.  This could be a function of road utilization (e.g., the sum of the squares of the utilization ratios for each road).

5.  **Optimization:** The core challenge is to balance efficiency and scalability.
    *   **Time Limit:** Your routing algorithm must be able to respond to updates and re-route traffic within a strict time limit (e.g., 1 second).  Solutions that take too long will be penalized.
    *   **Scalability:** Your system must be able to handle a large number of intersections, roads, and source-destination pairs (e.g., thousands or even millions).
    *   **Memory Limit:** Your solution has a memory limit. The efficiency of your data structures will be a contributing factor to the success of your solution.

6.  **Fault Tolerance (Bonus):** Consider the possibility of road closures due to accidents or maintenance.  Your system should be able to automatically re-route traffic around these closures.

**Constraints:**

*   Number of intersections: 1 to 10<sup>6</sup>
*   Number of roads: 1 to 5 * 10<sup>6</sup>
*   Number of source-destination pairs: 1 to 10<sup>5</sup>
*   Road capacity: 1 to 10<sup>3</sup> vehicles per minute
*   Traffic demand: 1 to 10<sup>3</sup> vehicles per minute
*   Time limit per update/re-route: 1 second
*   Memory limit:  [Define a reasonable memory limit based on your infrastructure, e.g., 4GB]

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does your system correctly route traffic while respecting road capacities?
*   **Efficiency:** How quickly does your system respond to dynamic updates?
*   **Scalability:** How well does your system handle large road networks and traffic demands?
*   **Congestion:** How well does your system minimize overall congestion?

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

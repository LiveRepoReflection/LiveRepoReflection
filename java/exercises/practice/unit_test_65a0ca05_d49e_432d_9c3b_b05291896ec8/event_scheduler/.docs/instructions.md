## Question: Scalable Event Scheduling

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a scalable event scheduling system. The system needs to manage a large number of events, each with a start time, end time, priority, and a set of resource requirements. The system must efficiently handle the following operations:

1.  **Schedule Event:** Given the event details (start time, end time, priority, resource requirements), schedule the event if the required resources are available during the specified time slot. If the event cannot be scheduled due to resource conflicts, the system should return a list of conflicting events.
2.  **Cancel Event:** Given an event ID, cancel the event and release the associated resources.
3.  **Query Events:** Given a time range (start time, end time), return a list of all events scheduled during that range, sorted by priority (highest priority first). If priorities are equal, sort events by start time (earliest first).
4.  **Optimize Resources:** Given a time range, identify and suggest a minimal set of lower-priority events that, if cancelled, would allow a new high-priority event to be scheduled within that range.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of events (millions) and concurrent requests.
*   **Efficiency:** The scheduling and querying operations should be highly efficient (logarithmic or better in the number of events).
*   **Real-time Responsiveness:** The system should provide near real-time responses for queries and scheduling requests.
*   **Resource Management:** Resources are represented by unique string identifiers (e.g., "CPU-1", "Database-A", "MeetingRoom-2"). Each event requires a specific set of resources.
*   **Priority:** Events have integer priorities, where a higher number indicates higher priority.
*   **Time:** Time is represented as a long integer representing epoch milliseconds.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** The system must accurately identify resource conflicts between events.
*   **Optimized Event Cancellation:** When a new event can't be scheduled, the system should suggest a minimal set of lower-priority events for cancellation to make room for the new event.  "Minimal" here means the smallest number of events. If multiple sets of events have the same minimum size, choose the set whose total priority is the lowest.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as overlapping time ranges, invalid input, and resource unavailability.

**Input:**

The system should accept the following inputs:

*   `Schedule Event`: Event ID (unique string), start time (long), end time (long), priority (int), set of required resources (Set\<String>).
*   `Cancel Event`: Event ID (string).
*   `Query Events`: Start time (long), end time (long).
*   `Optimize Resources`: Start time (long), end time (long), priority (int), set of required resources (Set\<String>).

**Output:**

The system should return the following outputs:

*   `Schedule Event`: `true` if the event is successfully scheduled, `false` otherwise. If `false`, return a list of conflicting event IDs.
*   `Cancel Event`: `true` if the event is successfully cancelled, `false` otherwise.
*   `Query Events`: A list of event IDs (strings) sorted by priority (highest first) and start time (earliest first).
*   `Optimize Resources`: A list of event IDs (strings) representing the minimal set of lower-priority events to cancel, or an empty list if no such set exists.

**Considerations:**

*   Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and execution time.
*   Consider using concurrent data structures to support concurrent requests.
*   Design your solution with modularity and maintainability in mind.
*   Think about how you would handle persistent storage of event data. (While persistent storage isn't required for this problem, consider its impact on the design).
*   Consider the scenario of a large number of resources.

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles. Good luck!

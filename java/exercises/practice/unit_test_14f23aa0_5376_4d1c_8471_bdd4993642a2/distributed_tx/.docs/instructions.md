Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging for experienced programmers.

## Project Name

`DistributedTransactionManager`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture. This DTM must ensure atomicity and consistency across multiple service operations using the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a simplified e-commerce system composed of two services:

1.  **Inventory Service:** Manages product inventory. Its primary operation is `reserve(productId, quantity)` which attempts to reserve the given quantity of a product.
2.  **Order Service:** Manages order creation. Its primary operation is `createOrder(userId, productId, quantity)` which creates a new order for the given user, product, and quantity.

A successful transaction requires both reserving the inventory and creating the order. If either operation fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Coordination:** Implement the core logic for the DTM. The DTM should:
    *   Initiate transactions with a unique transaction ID (UUID is recommended).
    *   Coordinate the 2PC protocol between the Inventory Service and the Order Service.
    *   Handle transaction commits and rollbacks.
    *   Provide a mechanism to register participating services (Inventory and Order services in this case).
    *   Ensure that the system is resilient to service failures during the transaction process.

2.  **Service Abstraction:** Define an interface `ParticipantService` that both the Inventory Service and the Order Service must implement. This interface should have the following methods:
    *   `prepare(transactionId, data)`: Attempts to prepare the service for the transaction. Returns `true` if prepared successfully, `false` otherwise.  `data` is a generic `Map<String, Object>` containing relevant parameters for the operation.
    *   `commit(transactionId)`:  Commits the service's part of the transaction.
    *   `rollback(transactionId)`: Rolls back the service's part of the transaction.

3.  **Idempotency:** Ensure that all operations (prepare, commit, rollback) are idempotent. This means that executing the same operation multiple times has the same effect as executing it once. This is crucial for handling potential network issues and retries.

4.  **Concurrency:** The DTM must handle concurrent transactions correctly. Ensure that transactions are isolated from each other and that data consistency is maintained. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks) to prevent race conditions.

5.  **Timeout Handling:** Implement a timeout mechanism. If a service fails to respond within a reasonable time during the prepare phase, the DTM should initiate a rollback for all participating services.

6.  **Failure Scenarios:**  Consider and handle the following failure scenarios:
    *   One or more services fail during the prepare phase.
    *   The DTM fails after the prepare phase but before sending commit/rollback commands. The services should be able to recover correctly upon DTM restart.
    *   One or more services fail during the commit/rollback phase.
    *   Network issues prevent communication between the DTM and the services.

7.  **Optimization:** Minimize the time required for transaction completion. Consider using asynchronous communication where appropriate to avoid blocking the DTM.  The prepare phase can be executed concurrently for each service.

8. **Data Storage:** The state of the DTM should be stored in memory.

**Constraints:**

*   You are allowed to use standard Java libraries and data structures. External libraries are discouraged unless absolutely necessary and clearly justified.
*   The Inventory and Order services are simulated within your code; you do not need to interact with external systems. Implement them with a simple in-memory data store (e.g., a `HashMap`).
*   Focus on the core DTM logic and 2PC implementation.  You do not need to implement full-fledged microservices.
*   Assume a relatively small number of concurrent transactions (e.g., up to 100). Scalability to a massive number of concurrent transactions is not a primary concern.
*   Assume that service failures are fail-stop (i.e., a service either works correctly or crashes completely).

**Example Usage:**

```java
// Initialize DTM
DistributedTransactionManager dtm = new DistributedTransactionManager();

// Register services
dtm.registerService("inventoryService", inventoryService);
dtm.registerService("orderService", orderService);

// Start a transaction
String transactionId = dtm.beginTransaction();

// Prepare data for the transaction
Map<String, Object> inventoryData = new HashMap<>();
inventoryData.put("productId", "product123");
inventoryData.put("quantity", 5);

Map<String, Object> orderData = new HashMap<>();
orderData.put("userId", "user456");
orderData.put("productId", "product123");
orderData.put("quantity", 5);

// Attempt to commit the transaction
boolean committed = dtm.commitTransaction(transactionId, Map.of("inventoryService", inventoryData, "orderService", orderData));

if (committed) {
    System.out.println("Transaction committed successfully.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Transaction rolled back.");
}
```

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and error handling. It's challenging due to the need to address multiple failure scenarios and ensure data consistency across services. Good luck!

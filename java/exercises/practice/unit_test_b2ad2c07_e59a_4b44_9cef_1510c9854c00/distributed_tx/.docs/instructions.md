Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Java coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator with Deadlock Detection

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a database system. This coordinator manages transactions across multiple database shards. Due to the distributed nature and concurrent operations, transactions can potentially deadlock. Your system must be able to detect and resolve deadlocks to ensure data consistency and system availability.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Management:** Implement methods to `begin()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` transactions. Each transaction is assigned a unique Transaction ID (TID).
2.  **Resource Locking:** Simulate resource locking by providing methods `acquireLock(TID, ResourceID)` and `releaseLock(TID, ResourceID)`. A resource can only be locked by one transaction at a time.  If a transaction attempts to acquire a lock held by another transaction, it must wait.
3.  **Deadlock Detection:** Implement a deadlock detection mechanism.  A cycle in the "waits-for" graph (transaction A waits for transaction B, which waits for transaction C, which waits for transaction A) constitutes a deadlock. Your system must detect these cycles.
4.  **Deadlock Resolution:** When a deadlock is detected, the system must abort one of the transactions involved in the cycle (the "victim").  The victim selection strategy is to abort the transaction that has held the fewest locks for the shortest duration.  Rollback the victim transaction and release all its locks.
5.  **Concurrency:** The system must handle concurrent transaction requests from multiple threads.  Ensure thread safety.
6.  **Timeouts:** Implement a timeout mechanism. If a transaction waits for a lock for longer than a specified timeout duration (e.g., 5 seconds), it should be considered a potential deadlock candidate and trigger the deadlock detection.

**Input:**

Your solution should provide the methods mentioned above (`begin`, `commit`, `rollback`, `acquireLock`, `releaseLock`).  The input to these methods will be:

*   `begin()`: No input; returns a unique TID.
*   `commit(TID)`: The Transaction ID to commit.
*   `rollback(TID)`: The Transaction ID to rollback.
*   `acquireLock(TID, ResourceID)`: The Transaction ID attempting to acquire the lock, and the ID of the resource to lock.
*   `releaseLock(TID, ResourceID)`: The Transaction ID releasing the lock, and the ID of the resource being released.

**Output:**

*   `begin()`: Returns a unique Transaction ID (TID) as a long.
*   `commit(TID)`: Returns `true` if the transaction committed successfully, `false` if the transaction was aborted due to a deadlock or other failure.
*   `rollback(TID)`: Returns `true` if the transaction rolled back successfully, `false` if the transaction was already completed or did not exist.
*   `acquireLock(TID, ResourceID)`: Returns `true` if the lock was acquired successfully, `false` if the transaction was aborted due to a deadlock or a timeout occurred before acquiring the lock. Throw an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock.
*   `releaseLock(TID, ResourceID)`: Returns `true` if the lock was released successfully, `false` if the transaction did not hold the lock.

**Constraints:**

*   The system must be highly concurrent.
*   Deadlock detection and resolution must be efficient.  Avoid O(n^2) or higher complexity algorithms for deadlock detection where 'n' is the number of transactions.
*   The number of resources and transactions can be very large (e.g., up to 100,000).
*   Resource IDs and Transaction IDs are represented as `long` values.
*   The timeout for acquiring a lock should be configurable.
*   Avoid unnecessary memory usage.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Multiple transactions attempting to acquire the same lock simultaneously.
*   Deadlocks involving more than two transactions.
*   Transactions attempting to commit or rollback after being aborted.
*   Transactions attempting to release locks they don't hold.
*   Empty transactions (transactions that begin but don't acquire any locks).
*   Reentrant locking (same transaction attempts to acquire the same lock multiple times). This should be allowed and tracked correctly.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Minimize the overhead of deadlock detection.  Consider triggering deadlock detection only when a transaction has been waiting for a lock for a significant period.
*   Use appropriate data structures (e.g., concurrent hash maps, thread-safe queues) to ensure thread safety and performance.
*   Optimize the victim selection strategy for deadlock resolution.
*   Avoid unnecessary synchronization.

This problem requires a deep understanding of concurrency, data structures, algorithms, and system design. Good luck!

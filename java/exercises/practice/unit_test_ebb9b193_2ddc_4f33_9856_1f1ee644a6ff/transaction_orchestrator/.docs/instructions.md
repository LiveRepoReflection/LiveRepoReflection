Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem for a high-level programming competition, focusing on difficulty, optimization, and real-world relevance.

**Problem Title:  Distributed Transaction Orchestration**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction orchestration system. Imagine a microservices architecture where multiple services need to participate in a single transaction.  If any service fails during the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participating services.

You'll be given a list of services, each representing a simplified database operation. Each service has a unique ID, a `commit()` method, and a `rollback()` method.  The `commit()` method simulates applying changes to a database, and the `rollback()` method simulates reverting those changes.  Crucially, both `commit()` and `rollback()` can sometimes fail.

Your goal is to implement a `TransactionOrchestrator` class that manages the execution of a distributed transaction involving these services. The orchestrator must ensure atomicity (all services commit or all services rollback) and durability (once committed, the changes are permanent).

**Input:**

*   A list of `Service` objects. Each `Service` object will have the following methods:
    *   `int getId()`: Returns the unique ID of the service.
    *   `boolean commit()`:  Simulates committing the transaction at this service. Returns `true` if successful, `false` if it fails.
    *   `boolean rollback()`: Simulates rolling back the transaction at this service. Returns `true` if successful, `false` if it fails.

**Output:**

The `TransactionOrchestrator` class should have a method `executeTransaction()` that returns a `boolean` value:

*   `true`: If the transaction was successfully committed across all services.
*   `false`: If the transaction failed and all necessary rollbacks were attempted (regardless of whether all rollbacks succeeded).

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

1.  **Service Failure:**  `commit()` and `rollback()` methods can fail (return `false`). Implement robust error handling.

2.  **Idempotency:**  The `commit()` and `rollback()` operations *might* be called multiple times for the same service.  Design your solution to handle this gracefully.  While the `Service` implementation is outside your control, your orchestrator should not assume that the services are inherently idempotent.

3.  **Deadlock Avoidance:**  If `rollback()` fails for a service, the orchestrator should retry the rollback operation.  However, to avoid infinite loops, implement a retry limit (e.g., maximum 3 retries).  If rollback fails after the retry limit is reached, log the error (e.g., print to console) and continue attempting to rollback other services.

4.  **Ordering:** The order in which services are provided matters.  Commits should be performed in the order the services are provided. Rollbacks should be performed in the *reverse* order of the commits.

5.  **Concurrency:** The `executeTransaction()` method may be called concurrently from multiple threads. Ensure thread safety.  Avoid deadlocks between concurrent transactions.

6.  **Optimization:** Minimize the overall execution time, especially when dealing with a large number of services. Consider potential parallelization opportunities, but balance this with the need for correct transaction ordering and rollback behavior.  You are not required to implement full parallelization but you should show consideration of it in your design.

7.  **Logging:** Implement basic logging (e.g., print to console) to track the progress of the transaction, including commit attempts, rollback attempts, and any failures.

8. **Service Immutability:** The `Service` objects themselves are immutable after being added to the orchestrator.

**Example:**

```java
// Simplified Service interface (you don't implement this)
interface Service {
    int getId();
    boolean commit();
    boolean rollback();
}

class TransactionOrchestrator {
    public TransactionOrchestrator(List<Service> services) {
        // Constructor implementation
    }

    public boolean executeTransaction() {
        // Implementation of the transaction orchestration logic
    }
}
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution correctly implement the distributed transaction semantics, ensuring atomicity and durability?
*   Error Handling:  Does the solution handle service failures gracefully and retry rollbacks appropriately?
*   Thread Safety:  Is the solution thread-safe and prevent deadlocks under concurrent access?
*   Optimization:  Does the solution minimize execution time, considering potential parallelization?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Handling Idempotency: Is the orchestrator designed to handle services that aren't intrinsically idempotent?

This problem requires careful consideration of concurrency, error handling, and distributed systems principles.  Good luck!

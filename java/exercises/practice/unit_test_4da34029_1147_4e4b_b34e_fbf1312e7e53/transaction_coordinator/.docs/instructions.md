## Question: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for a system handling financial transactions across multiple independent banking services. Each banking service manages its own database and exposes APIs to perform local transactions (e.g., debit account, credit account). A single global transaction might involve multiple banking services. Due to network instability and service failures, transactions can fail mid-process, leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

Your goal is to implement a coordinator that ensures the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of these global transactions.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:** Implement the 2PC protocol to coordinate transactions across the banking services. The coordinator must manage the prepare and commit/rollback phases.

2.  **Banking Service Interface:** Assume each banking service exposes the following simplified API:
    *   `prepare(transactionId)`: Prepares the service for a transaction. Returns `true` if prepared successfully, `false` otherwise. Preparation includes reserving resources and ensuring the transaction can be committed locally.
    *   `commit(transactionId)`: Commits the transaction.
    *   `rollback(transactionId)`: Rolls back the transaction.

3.  **Coordinator Functionality:**
    *   `beginTransaction(services)`: Starts a new global transaction involving a list of banking services.
    *   `performOperation(transactionId, operationDetails)`: Performs an operation within a transaction, using the provided details. This is a placeholder for the actual business logic and can be simulated.
    *   `commitTransaction(transactionId)`: Attempts to commit the global transaction.
    *   `rollbackTransaction(transactionId)`: Rolls back the global transaction.

4.  **Failure Handling:**
    *   **Service Failure:** Handle scenarios where a banking service fails to respond during the prepare or commit/rollback phases. Implement a timeout mechanism. After exceeding the timeout, consider the service unavailable.
    *   **Coordinator Failure:** The coordinator itself can fail. Implement a mechanism to recover the state of in-flight transactions upon coordinator restart. Assume a persistent log (e.g., file, database) is available to store transaction states.

5.  **Concurrency:** The coordinator must be able to handle multiple concurrent transactions.

**Constraints:**

*   **Idempotency:** The `commit` and `rollback` operations in the banking services must be idempotent (i.e., executing them multiple times has the same effect as executing them once).
*   **Timeout:** Implement a configurable timeout for each phase of the 2PC protocol (e.g., prepare timeout, commit timeout).
*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement a fully distributed system, consider how your design would scale to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and banking services.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Minimize Blocking Time:** Reduce the time banking services are blocked waiting for the coordinator's decision (commit or rollback).
*   **Maximize Throughput:** Optimize the coordinator to handle a high volume of transactions.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty transaction (no services involved).
*   A service is already involved in another transaction.
*   Network partitions between the coordinator and banking services.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Consider the data structures needed to store transaction state (e.g., transaction ID, involved services, current phase, prepare votes).
*   Think about how the coordinator persists its state to recover from failures.
*   How would you monitor the health of the coordinator and banking services?

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The 2PC protocol must be implemented correctly to guarantee atomicity.
*   The state recovery mechanism should be efficient to minimize downtime after a coordinator failure.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

Several approaches can be used to implement the coordinator, including:

*   Using threads or asynchronous tasks to handle concurrent transactions.
*   Implementing different strategies for handling service failures (e.g., retry, exponential backoff).
*   Choosing different persistence mechanisms for transaction state.

Your solution should demonstrate a clear understanding of the 2PC protocol, robust failure handling, and efficient transaction management.  You need to provide the classes and key methods to show the logic and structures to solve the problem.

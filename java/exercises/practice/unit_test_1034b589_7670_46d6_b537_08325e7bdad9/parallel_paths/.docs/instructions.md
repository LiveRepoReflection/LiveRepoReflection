`ParallelShortestPaths`

## Question Description

You are given a directed weighted graph representing a city's road network. The graph contains `n` nodes, representing intersections, and `m` edges, representing roads connecting these intersections. Each edge has a weight representing the time it takes to travel that road.

Your task is to implement a parallel algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given source node `s` to `k` destination nodes. The shortest paths need to be calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm, and the parallelization needs to exploit multi-core architectures to accelerate the computation.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the graph (numbered from 0 to n-1).
*   `m`: The number of edges in the graph.
*   `edges`: A list of tuples `(u, v, w)` representing a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with weight `w`.
*   `s`: The source node.
*   `destinations`: A list of `k` destination nodes.
*   `numThreads`: The number of threads to use for parallelization.

**Output:**

A list of `k` integers, where the `i`-th integer represents the length of the shortest path from `s` to the `i`-th destination node. If no path exists from `s` to a destination node, return `-1` for that destination.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= m <= 5 * 10^5`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= w <= 10^3`
*   `0 <= s < n`
*   `1 <= k <= min(100, n)`
*   `0 <= destinations[i] < n`
*   `1 <= numThreads <= number of cores available in the execution environment`
*   The graph might contain cycles.
*   The graph might not be strongly connected.
*   Destination nodes may be duplicates.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution must efficiently utilize the available `numThreads` to minimize the execution time.
*   The solution's performance should scale reasonably well with the number of cores (up to a point). Avoid excessive synchronization overhead.
*   The solution should be significantly faster than a sequential Dijkstra's algorithm when `numThreads > 1`.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about how to divide the work of computing shortest paths among the threads.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures for the priority queue in Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize performance.
*   Handle potential race conditions when multiple threads access shared data (e.g., distances to nodes).  Minimize lock contention where possible.
*   Think about the overhead of thread creation and synchronization, and how to balance it with the benefits of parallelization.
*   Consider using thread pools to reduce the overhead of creating new threads for each task.
*   Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large graphs.

This problem challenges you to design a parallel algorithm that efficiently solves a classic graph problem while considering real-world constraints and performance optimization.  Good luck!

## The Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified version of a distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture. The system aims to ensure atomicity across multiple services during a single logical transaction.

Imagine a scenario where a user wants to transfer funds from their account in Service A to another user's account in Service B. This transfer should be atomic: either both the debit in Service A and the credit in Service B succeed, or both operations are rolled back, leaving the system in a consistent state.

Your DTC should handle multiple concurrent transactions. Each transaction involves interacting with multiple services, each represented by an abstract "Service" class. Services can either successfully commit an operation or fail, requiring a rollback.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Service Interface:** Define an interface `Service` with two methods: `prepare(transactionId)` and `commit(transactionId)` and `rollback(transactionId)`. The `prepare()` method is called by the DTC to ask the service if it is ready to commit the transaction. The `commit()` method is called to actually perform the operation. The `rollback()` method is called to undo any changes made during the transaction.  Each call needs to return `boolean`, representing success or failure of the operation.

    ```java
    interface Service {
        boolean prepare(String transactionId);
        boolean commit(String transactionId);
        boolean rollback(String transactionId);
    }
    ```

2.  **Transaction Coordinator:** Implement a class `TransactionCoordinator` with the following methods:

    *   `begin()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique transaction ID (String).
    *   `enlistService(transactionId, service)`: Adds a service to the transaction identified by `transactionId`.
    *   `commit(transactionId)`: Attempts to commit the transaction. This involves the following steps:
        *   Call `prepare()` on each enlisted service. If *any* `prepare()` call fails, the transaction must be rolled back.
        *   If all `prepare()` calls succeed, call `commit()` on each enlisted service.
        *   If any `commit()` call fails, call `rollback()` on all services (including those that successfully committed) to ensure atomicity.
    *   `rollback(transactionId)`: Rolls back the transaction by calling `rollback()` on each enlisted service. This method should be called automatically if the `commit()` method fails.

3.  **Concurrency:** The `TransactionCoordinator` must be thread-safe and handle multiple concurrent transactions correctly. Consider using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

4.  **Idempotency:**  The `commit()` and `rollback()` methods of the `Service` interface may be called multiple times for the same transaction.  Ensure your `Service` implementations handle this gracefully and do not apply the changes or rollbacks multiple times (i.e., ensure idempotency).  The DTC should also handle calling `commit()` or `rollback()` multiple times for the same Transaction ID gracefully (e.g. by doing nothing).

5.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. Log any failures during prepare, commit, or rollback operations.  Consider a retry mechanism for transient failures (e.g., network glitches) during commit or rollback, but limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops. For this question, simply logging the error is sufficient, but the design should consider retries.

6.  **Optimization:**  The `prepare()` calls can be executed concurrently to reduce the overall transaction time. Implement this optimization.

**Constraints:**

*   Assume services can fail unpredictably.
*   Assume network communication between the DTC and services can be unreliable.
*   Minimize the time a transaction holds locks to maximize concurrency.
*   The number of services involved in a transaction can be large.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness (ensuring atomicity).
*   Concurrency (handling multiple transactions efficiently).
*   Robustness (handling service failures and network issues).
*   Code quality (clarity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices).
*   Idempotency handling.
*   Efficiency (optimizing transaction time).

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, and error handling. Good luck!

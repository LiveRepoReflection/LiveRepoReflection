## Question: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture. Imagine a system where multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) need to participate in a single, atomic transaction. If any service fails to commit its part of the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participating services.

Your transaction coordinator will receive requests to initiate transactions. Each transaction involves a set of operations, each performed by a separate service. These services expose a simple API: `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()`.

**Your task is to implement a `TransactionCoordinator` class that can:**

1.  **Initiate a transaction:** The coordinator receives a list of participating services (represented by their IDs and corresponding API endpoints, which you can simulate with simple interfaces) and a description of the operations each service needs to perform.

2.  **Coordinate the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol:** The coordinator must orchestrate the `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` calls to ensure atomicity.

    *   **Prepare Phase:** The coordinator sends a `prepare()` request to all participating services. Each service attempts to perform its operation tentatively and returns a "vote" (either "commit" or "abort").
    *   **Commit Phase:** If all services vote to commit, the coordinator sends a `commit()` request to all services.
    *   **Rollback Phase:** If any service votes to abort, or if the coordinator itself encounters an error (e.g., timeout), the coordinator sends a `rollback()` request to all services.

3.  **Handle failures:** The system must be resilient to service failures and network issues.

    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` calls. If a service does not respond within the timeout, the coordinator should consider it a failure and initiate a rollback.
    *   **Service Unavailability:** Handle scenarios where a service is temporarily unavailable.  The coordinator should retry the failed operation (prepare, commit or rollback) a certain number of times before giving up and initiating a rollback.
    *   **Idempotency:** Assume the services are not necessarily idempotent. Design your coordinator to minimize the chances of services receiving duplicate `commit()` or `rollback()` requests but do not assume it's impossible.  Focus on making sure the transaction eventually reaches a consistent state, even with potential duplicates.

4.  **Logging:** Maintain a log of transaction events (start, prepare votes, commit, rollback, failures) to aid in debugging and recovery.  The log doesn't need to persist between coordinator restarts.

5.  **Concurrency:** The coordinator must be able to handle multiple concurrent transactions.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Number of participating services:** Can be up to 100 per transaction.
*   **Network latency:** Assume significant network latency between the coordinator and the services.
*   **Service failure rate:** Services can fail intermittently.
*   **Optimization:** Minimize the overall transaction completion time while maintaining atomicity.  Consider the trade-offs between serial and parallel execution of operations.
*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement horizontal scaling, design your solution with scalability in mind.  Consider how your design would adapt if the number of transactions per second increased significantly.
*   **Avoid Deadlocks:** Be aware of potential deadlocks and design your solution to avoid them. For example, always acquire resources in a consistent order.

**Input:**

The input to the `TransactionCoordinator` will be a description of the transaction, including:

*   A unique transaction ID.
*   A list of participating service IDs and their API endpoints (represented by interfaces you define).
*   For each service, a description of the operation to be performed (represented by a simple string).

**Output:**

The `TransactionCoordinator` should return a boolean indicating whether the transaction was successfully committed or not.  The logs should record the detailed execution of the transaction.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. It also requires careful consideration of performance and scalability. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem for a high-level programming competition, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and real-world application:

**Problem: Scalable Collaborative Document Editing**

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for collaborative document editing.  Imagine a Google Docs-style application where multiple users can simultaneously edit the same document.  The document is represented as a single, very large string (potentially gigabytes in size).

The core challenge is to efficiently manage concurrent edits and ensure consistency across all users' views. Users submit edit operations, each described by a start index, a length to be replaced, and a replacement string. Your system needs to apply these operations in a manner that maintains document integrity and provides reasonable responsiveness to users.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Concurrency:**  The system must handle a high volume of concurrent edit requests from multiple users.  Assume thousands of simultaneous users.

2.  **Real-time Collaboration:**  Users should experience minimal latency in seeing each other's changes. While perfect real-time is impossible, strive for near real-time responsiveness.

3.  **Document Integrity:**  All users must eventually converge to the same, correct document state. Ensure that edits are applied in a consistent order, even if they arrive out of order.

4.  **Scalability:** The system must scale to handle very large documents (gigabytes in size) and a large number of concurrent users.  Memory usage should be optimized.

5.  **Edit Operation Format:** Edits are represented as tuples: `(startIndex, lengthToDelete, replacementString)`.  `startIndex` is the index in the document where the edit begins. `lengthToDelete` specifies the number of characters to remove starting from `startIndex`. `replacementString` is the string to insert at `startIndex` after deleting `lengthToDelete` characters.

6.  **Conflict Resolution:**  Develop a robust conflict resolution mechanism.  When two users edit the same section of the document nearly simultaneously, your system must decide how to reconcile the changes. A possible (but not required) approach is operational transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). Simpler solutions that prioritize eventual consistency with a reasonable reconciliation strategy are also acceptable if properly justified.

7.  **Performance:** The system must be optimized for both throughput (number of edits processed per second) and latency (time taken to apply an edit and propagate it to other users).  Consider the time complexity of your algorithms and data structures.

8. **Persistence:** The Document must be persisted to disk in a scalable way.

**Input:**

Your system will receive a stream of edit operations. Each operation will be formatted as `(userId, timestamp, startIndex, lengthToDelete, replacementString)`. `userId` is a unique identifier for the user making the edit. `timestamp` is the time the edit was created, in milliseconds since the epoch, and can be used for ordering operations.

**Output:**

The system does *not* need to output the entire document state after each edit. Instead, your solution should focus on the internal mechanisms of processing edits and maintaining document integrity. You may provide logging or debugging information to demonstrate the system's behavior.  The judging will primarily focus on the correctness, efficiency, and scalability of your implementation.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Does the system consistently produce the correct final document state after a series of concurrent edits?
*   **Concurrency Handling:**  How well does the system handle a high volume of concurrent edits?  Is it thread-safe?
*   **Scalability:**  Does the system scale to handle large documents and a large number of users?  Is memory usage optimized?
*   **Responsiveness:**  Does the system provide reasonable responsiveness to users, even under heavy load?  Is latency minimized?
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Is the conflict resolution mechanism robust and sensible? Does it prevent data loss or corruption?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Design Justification:** A clear explanation of the design choices, data structures used, and algorithmic approaches employed will be critical. Justify the trade-offs made and explain how the design addresses the challenges of concurrency, scalability, and performance.

This problem is intentionally open-ended, allowing for a wide range of solutions with varying levels of complexity and optimization. The best solutions will demonstrate a deep understanding of concurrent programming, data structures, and algorithms, and will be able to justify their design choices with clear reasoning and empirical evidence. Good luck!

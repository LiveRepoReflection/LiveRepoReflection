Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode's Hard difficulty, incorporating elements of advanced data structures, optimization, and real-world scenarios.

## Question: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a system where multiple services need to participate in a single, atomic transaction.  If any service fails to commit its changes, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participants.

Specifically, you need to implement a `TransactionCoordinator` class that manages transactions across a network of `ServiceEndpoint` instances.

**Core Functionality:**

The `TransactionCoordinator` must support the following operations:

1.  **`beginTransaction(transactionId)`:** Starts a new transaction with the given `transactionId`.  The `transactionId` is a unique identifier for the transaction (e.g., a UUID). If a transaction with the same ID already exists, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.

2.  **`enlistService(transactionId, serviceEndpoint)`:**  Registers a `ServiceEndpoint` with the specified transaction.  A service can only be enlisted once per transaction.  If the transaction does not exist, or the service is already enlisted, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.

3.  **`prepareTransaction(transactionId)`:** Initiates the "prepare" phase of the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.  The coordinator must send a "prepare" message to each enlisted `ServiceEndpoint` for the given transaction.  The `ServiceEndpoint` will respond with either "commit" or "rollback". The `prepareTransaction` method should return:

    *   `TransactionStatus.COMMIT` if all services respond with "commit".
    *   `TransactionStatus.ROLLBACK` if any service responds with "rollback" or if a service does not respond within a specified timeout.
    *   `TransactionStatus.UNKNOWN` if the coordinator cannot determine the final status (e.g., due to network errors persisting after retries).

4.  **`commitTransaction(transactionId)`:**  If `prepareTransaction` returned `TransactionStatus.COMMIT`, the coordinator must send a "commit" message to all enlisted `ServiceEndpoint` instances.

5.  **`rollbackTransaction(transactionId)`:** If `prepareTransaction` returned `TransactionStatus.ROLLBACK` or `TransactionStatus.UNKNOWN`, the coordinator must send a "rollback" message to all enlisted `ServiceEndpoint` instances.

6.  **`getTransactionStatus(transactionId)`:** Returns the current status of the transaction. Status can be `PREPARING`, `COMMITTING`, `ROLLING_BACK`, `COMMITTED`, `ROLLED_BACK`, `ACTIVE` (between beginTransaction and prepareTransaction), or `UNKNOWN`.

**Classes and Interfaces:**

You will need to define the following:

*   `TransactionCoordinator`: The main class responsible for managing transactions.
*   `ServiceEndpoint`: An interface representing a service that participates in transactions. It should have `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods that return a `ServiceResponse` enum (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `ERROR`). You can simulate network calls and potential failures in the implementation of this interface.
*   `TransactionStatus`: An enum representing the possible states of a transaction (described above).
*   `ServiceResponse`: An enum representing the possible responses from a service during the prepare phase.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The `TransactionCoordinator` must be thread-safe. Multiple threads may attempt to access and modify the transaction state concurrently.
*   **Timeouts and Retries:** Implement timeouts for service responses during the `prepareTransaction` phase. If a service doesn't respond within the timeout, retry a configurable number of times before considering it a failure.
*   **Idempotency:** The `commit()` and `rollback()` operations on `ServiceEndpoint` instances should be idempotent.  That is, calling them multiple times should have the same effect as calling them once. The coordinator should handle potential message duplication.
*   **Scalability:** Consider how your design could be scaled to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and services. (Though you don't have to *implement* scaling, your code should be designed with scaling considerations in mind).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging. The coordinator should gracefully handle network failures, service unavailability, and other potential errors.
*   **Memory Management:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of transactions. Avoid memory leaks.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for performance. The `prepareTransaction` method, in particular, should be efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of participating services. Use appropriate data structures for efficient lookups and updates.
*   **Logging:** Implement a simple logging mechanism to track transaction events (begin, enlist, prepare, commit, rollback, status changes, errors).

**Example Scenario:**

Service A, Service B, and Service C need to update their respective databases as part of a single transaction. The `TransactionCoordinator` coordinates the transaction:

1.  `beginTransaction("tx123")`
2.  `enlistService("tx123", ServiceA)`
3.  `enlistService("tx123", ServiceB)`
4.  `enlistService("tx123", ServiceC)`
5.  `prepareTransaction("tx123")`
    *   The coordinator sends "prepare" to A, B, and C.
    *   If all return "commit," `prepareTransaction` returns `TransactionStatus.COMMIT`.
    *   If any return "rollback," `prepareTransaction` returns `TransactionStatus.ROLLBACK`.
    *   If any timeout or return an error after retries, `prepareTransaction` returns `TransactionStatus.UNKNOWN`.
6.  Based on the result of `prepareTransaction`, either `commitTransaction("tx123")` or `rollbackTransaction("tx123")` is called.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The code must correctly implement the 2PC protocol.
*   Robustness: The code must handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
*   Concurrency: The code must be thread-safe.
*   Performance: The code must be efficient.
*   Design: The code must be well-structured and maintainable.
*   Scalability: The design should consider scalability.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and data structures. Good luck!

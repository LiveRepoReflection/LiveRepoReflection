Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Manager

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory, distributed transaction manager for a microservices architecture.  Imagine you have multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) that need to participate in atomic transactions.  A transaction must either commit across all services *or* rollback across all services.  Your transaction manager will orchestrate this process.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **Transaction Creation:**  The transaction manager should be able to create a new transaction with a unique ID.

2.  **Participant Registration:** Individual services can register as *participants* in a given transaction.  Each participant provides two methods: `prepare()` and `commit()`/`rollback()`.
    *   `prepare()`: This method is called by the transaction manager to determine if the participant *can* commit its part of the transaction. It should return `true` if the participant is ready to commit, and `false` if it cannot (e.g., due to resource constraints, data conflicts, etc.). The `prepare()` should execute quickly and should *not* permanently alter any state; it's a check, not a commit.  The participant should retain the state for commit or rollback.
    *   `commit()`: This method is called to finalize the changes.  It should perform the actual data changes and return `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.
    *   `rollback()`: This method is called to undo any changes made by the participant.  It should revert to the state before the transaction began and return `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.

3.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:** Implement the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity. This involves two phases:
    *   *Prepare Phase:* The transaction manager sends a `prepare()` request to all registered participants.  If *all* participants return `true`, the transaction proceeds to the commit phase. If *any* participant returns `false`, the transaction enters the rollback phase.
    *   *Commit/Rollback Phase:* If the prepare phase was successful (all participants returned `true`), the transaction manager sends a `commit()` request to all participants.  If the prepare phase failed (at least one participant returned `false`), the transaction manager sends a `rollback()` request to all participants.

4.  **Concurrency Handling:** The transaction manager must handle concurrent transaction requests safely.  Multiple transactions can be active simultaneously, and your implementation must ensure that they do not interfere with each other.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores) to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

5.  **Timeout Mechanism:**  Implement a timeout mechanism for both the prepare and commit/rollback phases. If a participant does not respond within a specified timeout, the transaction manager should consider the participant as failed and proceed with a rollback (even if other participants have prepared successfully).  The timeout duration should be configurable.

6.  **Failure Handling:** The transaction manager should gracefully handle participant failures. If a participant fails to commit or rollback, the transaction manager should log the error and attempt to retry the operation a configurable number of times. After exceeding the retry limit, the transaction manager should mark the transaction as failed and potentially alert an administrator.  The retry interval should also be configurable.

7.  **Idempotency:** Consider how your design could ensure idempotency for `commit` and `rollback` operations. Participants might receive these requests multiple times due to network issues.

**Constraints:**

*   All operations are in-memory. No persistent storage is required.
*   The number of participants in a transaction is limited (e.g., maximum of 10).
*   The timeout duration for prepare and commit/rollback phases should be configurable (e.g., 1000ms).
*   The number of retries for failed commit/rollback operations should be configurable (e.g., 3 retries).
*   The retry interval should be configurable (e.g., 500ms).
*   Assume that participants are prone to temporary failures (network issues, resource contention).
*   You must provide a thread-safe implementation.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the transaction manager correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity?
*   Concurrency:  Does the implementation handle concurrent transactions safely?
*   Performance:  Is the transaction manager efficient in terms of resource utilization and response time?  Avoid unnecessary overhead.
*   Robustness:  Does the transaction manager handle participant failures gracefully?
*   Scalability:  How well does the design scale to a larger number of participants and concurrent transactions (even though the implementation is in-memory)? Consider design choices that would facilitate scaling if persistence were introduced.
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?  Use appropriate design patterns and follow coding best practices.
*   Error Handling:  Does the implementation handle errors and exceptions appropriately?
*   Testability:  Is the code designed in a way that is easy to test?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. A well-designed solution will demonstrate a strong grasp of these principles and produce a robust and efficient transaction manager. Good luck!

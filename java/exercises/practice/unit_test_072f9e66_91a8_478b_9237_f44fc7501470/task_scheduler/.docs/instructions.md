## Question: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

You are tasked with designing an efficient task scheduling system for a large-scale distributed computing platform. The platform supports a variety of tasks, each with its own execution time, deadline, dependencies, and resource requirements.

**Task Representation:**

Each task is represented by a `Task` object with the following properties:

*   `id` (String): A unique identifier for the task.
*   `executionTime` (int): The time (in arbitrary units) required to execute the task.
*   `deadline` (int): The latest time (in the same units as `executionTime`) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies` (List<String>): A list of task IDs that must be completed before this task can start.  An empty list indicates no dependencies.
*   `resourceRequirements` (Map<String, Integer>): A map representing the resources required by the task. The key is the resource type (e.g., "CPU", "Memory", "GPU") and the value is the amount of that resource needed.

**System Constraints:**

*   The platform has a limited amount of each resource. This is represented by a `SystemResources` object, which is a `Map<String, Integer>` similar to `resourceRequirements`, indicating the total available amount for each resource type.
*   A task can only be executed if all of its dependencies have been completed.
*   A task can only be executed if the system has sufficient available resources to satisfy its `resourceRequirements`. Resources are released immediately upon task completion.
*   Only one task can execute on the platform at any given time (single-threaded execution).
*   Tasks cannot be preempted; once a task starts executing, it must run to completion.

**Objective:**

Develop an algorithm that schedules the tasks to maximize the number of tasks completed before their deadlines.

**Input:**

*   `tasks` (List<Task>): A list of `Task` objects representing the tasks to be scheduled.
*   `systemResources` (Map<String, Integer>): A map representing the total available resources in the system.

**Output:**

*   `scheduledTasks` (List<String>): A list of task IDs, representing the optimal schedule of tasks that maximizes the number of tasks completed before their deadlines.  The order of task IDs in the list represents the execution order.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Prioritization:**  You need to determine a suitable task prioritization strategy.  Consider factors such as deadline, execution time, number of dependencies, and resource requirements. Experiment with different priority schemes (e.g., Earliest Deadline First, Shortest Job First, Critical Path Method with Resource Constraints).
2.  **Dependency Resolution:** Efficiently handle task dependencies to ensure that no task starts before its dependencies are met.
3.  **Resource Allocation:** Implement a robust resource allocation mechanism to prevent over-allocation and ensure that tasks can only execute when sufficient resources are available.
4.  **Deadlock Avoidance:** Your algorithm must avoid deadlocks that could occur due to circular dependencies or resource contention.  If a deadlock is detected (or a schedule is impossible), return an empty list.
5.  **Scalability:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle a large number of tasks (up to 10,000) and resource types.  Consider the time complexity of your solution.
6.  **Optimization:** Maximize the number of tasks completed before their deadlines. The scheduling should be optimized.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as empty task lists, tasks with circular dependencies, tasks with impossible deadlines (deadline < executionTime), and insufficient resources.
8.  **Valid Schedule:** Ensure that the final schedule is valid, meaning that all dependencies are met, resource constraints are satisfied, and all tasks in the schedule finish before their deadlines.
9.  **Tie-Breaking:** If multiple tasks have the same priority, implement a consistent tie-breaking mechanism (e.g., lexicographical order of task IDs).

This is a challenging problem that requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and careful consideration of constraints and trade-offs. A brute-force approach is likely to be infeasible for large task sets, so you will need to design a more intelligent and efficient algorithm.

## Question: Distributed Transaction Manager

### Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory, distributed transaction manager for a system that operates across multiple independent services. Each service manages its own data and can perform local transactions. However, complex operations may require transactions that span multiple services, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) across the entire system.

Your transaction manager should implement a simplified version of the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol to coordinate transactions across services. The system will involve a central coordinator and multiple participating services.

**Scenario:**

Imagine an e-commerce system where placing an order involves multiple services:

*   **Inventory Service:** Manages product inventory.
*   **Payment Service:** Processes payments.
*   **Order Service:** Creates and manages order records.

A successful order placement requires:

1.  Reserving the items in the Inventory Service.
2.  Processing the payment in the Payment Service.
3.  Creating the order record in the Order Service.

If any of these steps fail, the entire transaction should be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction ID Generation:** Implement a mechanism to generate unique transaction IDs for each distributed transaction.

2.  **Coordinator:** Implement a `Coordinator` class with the following methods:

    *   `beginTransaction()`: Starts a new distributed transaction, generates a transaction ID, and registers the participating services.
    *   `prepareTransaction(transactionId)`: Sends a "prepare" message to all registered services, requesting them to prepare for the commit. The coordinator should keep track of the services that have successfully prepared.
    *   `commitTransaction(transactionId)`: If all services have prepared successfully, send a "commit" message to all registered services.
    *   `rollbackTransaction(transactionId)`: If any service fails to prepare, or if an error occurs, send a "rollback" message to all registered services.
    *   `registerService(service, transactionId)`: register a service to the coordinator.

3.  **Service Interface:** Define a `Service` interface with the following methods:

    *   `prepare(transactionId)`: Executes the local transaction steps and returns `true` if prepared successfully, `false` otherwise.  The service can simulate errors or resource unavailability.
    *   `commit(transactionId)`: Commits the local transaction.
    *   `rollback(transactionId)`: Rolls back the local transaction.
    *   `getServiceName()`: Returns the service name.

4.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and logging. The coordinator should handle service failures gracefully and ensure that transactions are rolled back if necessary.

5.  **Concurrency:** Design the transaction manager to handle concurrent transactions. Consider thread safety and potential race conditions. Each service can handle only **one transaction at a time**. If a service receives a prepare request before it finishes the previous one, then it should return false to indicate the prepare failure.

6.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for the prepare phase. If a service does not respond within a specified time, the coordinator should consider it as a failure and rollback the transaction.

**Constraints:**

*   Implement this in-memory. Do not use external databases or persistent storage.
*   Focus on the core 2PC logic. You don't need to implement full-fledged distributed systems features.
*   Simulate service behavior (success, failure, timeout) programmatically.
*   Assume a relatively small number of services per transaction (e.g., less than 10).
*   The solution must be thread-safe and efficient in terms of resource usage.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a recovery mechanism for the coordinator in case of failure during the transaction.
*   Explore alternative consensus algorithms for transaction coordination.
*   Implement a more sophisticated conflict detection and resolution mechanism.

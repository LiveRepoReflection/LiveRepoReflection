## The Distributed Load Balancer with Adaptive Routing

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed load balancer. This load balancer must distribute incoming requests across a cluster of backend servers, ensuring high availability, low latency, and optimal resource utilization.

**System Architecture:**

The system consists of:

1.  **Load Balancer Nodes:** Multiple load balancer nodes are deployed to handle incoming client requests. Each load balancer node independently decides which backend server to forward a request to.
2.  **Backend Servers:** A cluster of backend servers that process the actual client requests. Each server has a certain capacity and current load.
3.  **Centralized Monitoring Service:** This service periodically collects performance metrics from both the load balancer nodes and the backend servers. These metrics include:

    *   **Backend Server Load:** CPU utilization, memory usage, number of active connections.
    *   **Backend Server Capacity:** Maximum number of concurrent requests the server can handle.
    *   **Load Balancer Node Latency:** Average time taken to forward a request to a backend server.
    *   **Backend Server Latency:** Average time taken by a backend server to process a request.
4.  **Adaptive Routing Algorithm:** The core of the load balancer. It must dynamically adjust the routing decisions based on the metrics provided by the monitoring service.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Request Distribution:** Implement a mechanism to distribute requests across backend servers based on their capacity and current load. Avoid overloading any single server while ensuring all servers are utilized effectively.
2.  **Health Checks:** Periodically check the health status of each backend server. Remove unhealthy servers from the routing pool.
3.  **Adaptive Routing:** Implement an adaptive routing algorithm that considers the following factors:

    *   **Backend Server Load:** Route requests to servers with lower load.
    *   **Backend Server Latency:** Prioritize servers with lower latency.
    *   **Load Balancer Node Latency:** Minimize the latency introduced by the load balancer itself.
4.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The number of backend servers and load balancer nodes can change dynamically. The system must automatically adapt to these changes without requiring a restart.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be fault-tolerant. If a load balancer node fails, other nodes should continue to operate without interruption. If a backend server fails, traffic should be automatically rerouted to healthy servers.
6.  **Scalability:** The system must be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent requests and a large number of backend servers.
7.  **Optimization:** Optimize the routing algorithm to minimize the overall response time and maximize throughput. Consider different optimization techniques, such as weighted least connections, round robin with dynamic weights, or reinforcement learning-based routing.

**Input:**

*   A stream of incoming client requests, each represented by a unique ID.
*   Periodic updates from the centralized monitoring service, providing the current load, capacity, and latency information for each backend server and load balancer node.

**Output:**

*   For each incoming request, output the ID of the backend server to which the request is forwarded.
*   Report the overall system latency (average time from request arrival to completion) and throughput (number of requests processed per second).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of backend servers can range from 10 to 1000.
*   The number of load balancer nodes can range from 5 to 50.
*   The request arrival rate can vary from 1,000 to 100,000 requests per second.
*   The system must maintain high availability (at least 99.99% uptime).
*   The maximum acceptable latency is 200 milliseconds for 95% of the requests.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The system must correctly route requests to backend servers and handle failures gracefully.
*   **Performance:** The system must achieve low latency and high throughput under varying load conditions.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests and a large number of backend servers.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to failures of load balancer nodes and backend servers.
*   **Code Quality:** The code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, load balancing algorithms, and performance optimization techniques. Good luck!

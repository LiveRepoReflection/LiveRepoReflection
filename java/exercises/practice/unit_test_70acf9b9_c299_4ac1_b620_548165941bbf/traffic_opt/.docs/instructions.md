## Question: Optimal Traffic Light Scheduling

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the traffic flow in a city using a sophisticated traffic light control system. The city can be represented as a directed graph where intersections are nodes and roads connecting them are edges. Each road has a capacity representing the maximum number of vehicles that can traverse it per unit time. Each intersection has a traffic light that controls the flow of traffic.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that determines the optimal timing for each traffic light to minimize the average travel time of vehicles across the city during peak hours.

**Specifics:**

*   **Input:**
    *   A directed graph representing the city's road network. Each node (intersection) has a unique ID (integer). Each edge (road) has the following attributes:
        *   `source` (node ID): The starting intersection.
        *   `destination` (node ID): The ending intersection.
        *   `capacity` (integer): Maximum vehicles per unit time.
        *   `travel_time` (integer): The time it takes to traverse the road when traffic is flowing freely.
    *   A set of origin-destination (OD) pairs, representing the typical routes vehicles take during peak hours. Each OD pair has:
        *   `origin` (node ID): The starting intersection of the route.
        *   `destination` (node ID): The ending intersection of the route.
        *   `demand` (integer): The number of vehicles that want to travel along this route per unit time.
    *   A range for the traffic light cycle time (minCycleTime, maxCycleTime). All traffic lights have the same cycle time.
    *   A minimum green time (minGreenTime) for each direction at an intersection. This ensures vehicles have a reasonable time to pass. Each traffic light has directions.
    *   A maximum number of vehicles (maxVehicles) that can be simulated to avoid infinite loops.

*   **Traffic Light Configuration:**
    *   Each intersection has a traffic light that cycles through different phases. Each phase allows traffic to flow from a subset of incoming roads to a subset of outgoing roads. You do *not* need to determine the phases; assume they are pre-defined and fixed for each intersection.
    *   Each phase has a duration (green time). The sum of green times for all phases at an intersection must equal the cycle time.
    *   You are allowed to adjust the green time for each phase within the cycle time, subject to `minGreenTime`. The green times must be integers.

*   **Output:**
    *   An optimal cycle time and a green time for each phase at each intersection, such that the average travel time across all OD pairs is minimized.
    *   The average travel time using your optimal traffic light configuration.
    *   If no feasible solution is found, return an appropriate error message and a large travel time value (e.g., `Double.MAX_VALUE`).

*   **Constraints:**
    *   The graph can be large (up to 1000 intersections, 5000 roads).
    *   The number of OD pairs can be significant (up to 1000).
    *   The demand for each OD pair can vary widely.
    *   The capacity of each road is limited.
    *   The traffic light cycle time must be within the specified range.
    *   The green time for each phase must be greater than or equal to the minimum green time.
    *   The algorithm must be efficient enough to find a solution within a reasonable time (e.g., a few minutes).

*   **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the average travel time across all vehicles, calculated as:

    ```
    Average Travel Time = (Sum of (Demand for OD * Travel Time for OD)) / (Total Demand)
    ```

    The travel time for an OD pair is the time it takes for vehicles to travel from the origin to the destination, considering waiting times at traffic lights.

**Considerations:**

*   **Traffic Simulation:** You will need to simulate traffic flow to estimate the travel time for each OD pair given a traffic light configuration.  Consider how you will handle congestion and queuing at intersections.
*   **Optimization Strategy:**  Finding the absolute optimal solution is likely intractable. Consider using heuristic optimization techniques such as:
    *   Simulated Annealing
    *   Genetic Algorithms
    *   Gradient Descent (if you can formulate the problem in a differentiable way)
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Disconnected graph:  Handle cases where some intersections are unreachable.
    *   Zero demand for some OD pairs.
    *   Road capacities that are insufficient to handle the demand.
    *   Infeasible traffic light configurations (e.g., not enough green time to satisfy minimum requirements).
    *   Conflicting routes that share the same roads, causing bottlenecks.

*   **Efficiency:** Given the size of the graph and the number of OD pairs, the algorithm must be efficient. Avoid brute-force approaches. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms for graph traversal and traffic simulation.

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, traffic flow dynamics, and optimization techniques. Efficient implementation and careful handling of edge cases are critical for success. Good luck!

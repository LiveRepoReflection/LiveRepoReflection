Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard difficulty, focusing on algorithmic efficiency, advanced data structures, and real-world considerations.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Manager

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a scenario where multiple microservices need to coordinate to complete a single business transaction. If any microservice fails during the transaction, the entire transaction needs to be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

Your DTM needs to handle the "Two-Phase Commit" (2PC) protocol to ensure atomicity across the involved microservices.

**Services:** Assume there are `n` microservices involved in each transaction.  Each service is identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `n-1`.

**Transaction:** A transaction involves operations on multiple services.  It's represented by a set of service IDs.

**Your Task:** Implement a `TransactionManager` class with the following methods:

1.  **`boolean beginTransaction(int transactionId, Set<Integer> participatingServices)`**:  Starts a new transaction with the given `transactionId` and a set of `participatingServices`.  The `transactionId` is a unique positive integer. Return `true` if the transaction is successfully started, `false` if a transaction with the same ID already exists.

2.  **`boolean prepare(int transactionId, int serviceId)`**:  Simulates the "prepare" phase of the 2PC protocol for the given `serviceId` within the specified `transactionId`.  Each service can either agree or refuse to commit its part of the transaction.  Assume a service always returns `true` (agree) if it hasn't yet refused for this transaction.  After refusing once, it will always refuse. Return `true` if the service agrees to commit, `false` if it refuses.

3.  **`boolean commitTransaction(int transactionId)`**:  Initiates the commit phase for the specified `transactionId`. This method should only proceed if all participating services have successfully prepared (returned `true` from `prepare()`).  If all services prepared successfully, commit the transaction (no actual commit to a database is required; simply record that the transaction was successful) and return `true`. If any service refused to prepare, rollback the transaction (mark the transaction as failed) and return `false`.

4.  **`boolean rollbackTransaction(int transactionId)`**: Rolls back the specified `transactionId`. This method should be callable even if the transaction has not started (i.e., prepare has not been called on any services).  Mark the transaction as failed.  Return `true` if the transaction was successfully rolled back (or marked as failed), `false` if the transaction ID does not exist.

5.  **`boolean isTransactionSuccessful(int transactionId)`**:  Returns `true` if the transaction with the given `transactionId` was successfully committed, `false` otherwise (if it failed, was rolled back, or doesn't exist).

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** Design your `TransactionManager` to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and services. Consider thread safety.
*   **Efficiency:** Optimize for fast lookup of transactions and services.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle cases where transaction IDs are invalid, services are not participating in a transaction, or operations are attempted in an incorrect order.  Throw exceptions where appropriate.
*   **Concurrency:** Multiple threads might call these methods concurrently. Ensure thread safety without introducing significant performance bottlenecks.
*   **Memory Management:** Avoid memory leaks. Clean up data structures when transactions are completed or rolled back.
*   **Idempotency:** While not strictly required, consider the implications of calling `commitTransaction` or `rollbackTransaction` multiple times for the same transaction.

**Example:**

```java
TransactionManager tm = new TransactionManager();
Set<Integer> services = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
tm.beginTransaction(123, services);

tm.prepare(123, 1); // returns true
tm.prepare(123, 2); // returns true
tm.prepare(123, 3); // returns true

tm.commitTransaction(123); // returns true
tm.isTransactionSuccessful(123); // returns true
```

```java
TransactionManager tm = new TransactionManager();
Set<Integer> services = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
tm.beginTransaction(456, services);

tm.prepare(456, 1); // returns true
tm.prepare(456, 2); // returns false (service 2 refuses)
tm.prepare(456, 3); // returns true (but this is irrelevant now)

tm.commitTransaction(456); // returns false
tm.isTransactionSuccessful(456); // returns false
```

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a timeout mechanism for transactions that are taking too long.
*   Add a `recover()` method that can be called after a system crash to recover the state of in-flight transactions from a persistent storage (e.g., a log file).  Assume that the log file contains the history of all `beginTransaction`, `prepare`, `commitTransaction`, and `rollbackTransaction` calls.
*   Consider implementing an optimization where the prepare phase is skipped for read-only services.

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and distributed systems concepts. Good luck!

## Question: Distributed Transaction Manager

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager for a microservices architecture. Imagine a system where multiple independent services need to coordinate to complete a single business transaction. If one service fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data consistency across all services.

Your system must implement the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. The core components are a central Transaction Manager (TM) and multiple Resource Managers (RMs), each representing a microservice.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** A client (e.g., an API gateway) initiates a transaction by sending a `beginTransaction()` request to the Transaction Manager. The TM generates a unique transaction ID (TXID) and registers the participating Resource Managers (RMs) for that TXID. The client provides this TXID when interacting with the RMs.

2.  **Resource Manager Operations (Phase 1: Prepare):** When a client requests an operation on a Resource Manager within a transaction, the RM performs the operation tentatively. It then sends a "vote" (either "commit" or "abort") to the Transaction Manager. The RM must persist the prepared state so that it can commit or rollback later.

3.  **Transaction Manager Coordination (Phase 2: Commit/Rollback):** The Transaction Manager collects votes from all RMs registered for a given TXID.

    *   If all RMs vote "commit," the TM sends a "commit" message to all RMs.
    *   If any RM votes "abort," or if the TM doesn't receive a vote from an RM within a predefined timeout, the TM sends an "abort" message to all RMs.

4.  **Resource Manager Completion:** Upon receiving a "commit" message, an RM permanently applies the prepared operation. Upon receiving an "abort" message, the RM rolls back the prepared operation.

5.  **Transaction Completion:** Once all RMs have acknowledged the "commit" or "abort" message, the Transaction Manager marks the transaction as completed and informs the initiating client.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Atomicity:** The entire transaction must either fully succeed (commit) or fully fail (rollback) across all participating Resource Managers.
*   **Durability:** Once an RM votes "commit", it must be able to commit the transaction even if it crashes before receiving the final "commit" message from the TM.  This means persisting the prepared state.
*   **Isolation:** While not explicitly required to implement concurrency control within the RMs themselves, your system should handle concurrent transaction requests to the TM correctly, ensuring that transactions are processed in a consistent manner.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to RM failures. Implement a timeout mechanism in the TM. If an RM doesn't respond within a reasonable time, the transaction should be aborted. (Assume the TM itself does not fail).
*   **Scalability:** Consider the design in terms of scalability.  While not requiring actual distributed implementation, think about how the different components would interact in a distributed environment and what potential bottlenecks might arise.  Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:**  Design the communication protocol and data structures to minimize the risk of deadlocks. While deadlock *detection* is not required, the design should avoid scenarios where the TM could be blocked indefinitely waiting for RMs.
*   **Optimistic Commit:** The Resource Manager should assume that the operation will succeed and only vote 'abort' if there is a known failure (e.g., data validation failure, resource unavailable).
*   **Idempotency:** The 'commit' and 'abort' operations on the Resource Manager must be idempotent. The RM must be able to handle receiving the same 'commit' or 'abort' message multiple times without adverse effects.

**Input/Output:**

The problem is conceptual; you are to implement the core logic of the Transaction Manager and a simplified Resource Manager.  You do not need to implement a full-fledged network communication layer.  Instead, you can simulate communication using method calls or shared data structures.

**Specific Tasks:**

1.  **Implement the `TransactionManager` class:**
    *   `beginTransaction()`: Generates a TXID and registers participating RMs.
    *   `receiveVote(TXID, RM_ID, vote)`: Receives a vote from a Resource Manager.
    *   `runTransaction(TXID)`: Orchestrates the 2PC protocol based on collected votes.
    *   Include proper timeout functionality.

2.  **Implement the `ResourceManager` class:**
    *   `prepare(TXID, operationData)`: Tentatively performs the operation and persists its state. Returns "commit" or "abort".
    *   `commit(TXID)`: Permanently applies the operation.
    *   `abort(TXID)`: Rolls back the operation.

3.  **Implement a simple simulation:** Demonstrate how a client would initiate a transaction, interact with multiple RMs, and how the TM would coordinate the commit or rollback.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the system correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity?
*   Durability: Are prepared operations persisted correctly to handle RM failures?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does the timeout mechanism work correctly, and are transactions aborted when RMs fail to respond?
*   Scalability Considerations: Is the design efficient and scalable in a distributed environment?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Deadlock Avoidance: Does the design minimize the risk of deadlocks?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed transaction management, the Two-Phase Commit protocol, and careful consideration of various failure scenarios and performance implications. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging and sophisticated Java coding problem, designed to be as difficult as a LeetCode Hard question.

**Project Name:** `EfficientRoutePlanner`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient route planner for a delivery service operating in a large metropolitan area. The city is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent roads. Each road has a `length` (in meters) and a `speed limit` (in km/h).

Your system must handle a large number of delivery requests concurrently. Each delivery request specifies:

*   A `start` intersection (node ID).
*   An `end` intersection (node ID).
*   A `departure time` (in seconds since the start of the day - 00:00:00).
*   A `weight` of the package to be delivered.

The goal is to find the *fastest* route for each delivery request, considering the road lengths and speed limits, and the current traffic conditions.

**Traffic conditions** are represented by a dynamic system. The base travel time for any given road is calculated using the road's length and speed limit. However, the actual travel time can vary throughout the day due to traffic.

You are given a stream of `TrafficUpdate` events. Each `TrafficUpdate` event specifies:

*   A `road` (represented by the start and end node IDs).
*   A `time window` (start time and end time, both in seconds since the start of the day).
*   A `congestion factor`. This is a multiplier that increases the base travel time during the specified time window.  A congestion factor of 1.0 means no congestion. A factor of 2.0 means the travel time is doubled during that period.

The route planner must:

1.  **Preprocess the city graph:**  Optimize the graph representation for efficient route searching. Consider techniques like contraction hierarchies or similar to accelerate pathfinding.

2.  **Handle Traffic Updates:**  Dynamically update the graph's edge weights based on incoming `TrafficUpdate` events.  These updates can arrive at any time, and the system must remain responsive. You will need to implement an efficient data structure to store and query the traffic updates.

3.  **Find the Fastest Route:** For each delivery request, find the fastest route from the start to the end intersection, considering the departure time and the current traffic conditions. The route must be returned as a list of node IDs representing the path.

4.  **Minimize Latency:** The system must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent delivery requests and traffic updates with minimal latency.

**Constraints:**

*   The city graph can be very large (millions of nodes and edges).
*   The number of concurrent delivery requests can be in the thousands.
*   Traffic updates can arrive frequently (hundreds per second).
*   The departure times for delivery requests can span the entire day.
*   The system must be memory-efficient. Storing all traffic updates for the entire day is not feasible.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Route Calculation:** The route calculation algorithm must be highly optimized.  A naive Dijkstra's algorithm will likely not be sufficient.
*   **Traffic Update Handling:**  The traffic update mechanism must be efficient. Applying updates to the entire graph on every event is not acceptable.
*   **Concurrency:**  The system must be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent requests and updates without contention.

**Edge Cases:**

*   No route exists between the start and end intersections.
*   The start and end intersections are the same.
*   Traffic updates overlap in time.
*   The congestion factor is zero or negative (should be treated as invalid and ignored).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

The solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  The routes returned must be the fastest possible routes, considering traffic conditions.
*   **Performance:**  The system must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests and updates with minimal latency.
*   **Memory Usage:**  The system must be memory-efficient.
*   **Code Quality:**  The code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and concurrent programming. Good luck!

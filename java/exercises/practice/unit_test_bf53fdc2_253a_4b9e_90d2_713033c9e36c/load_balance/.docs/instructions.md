## Question: Distributed Load Balancer Optimization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a highly optimized distributed load balancer for a critical online service. The service consists of a cluster of `N` identical backend servers, each with a finite processing capacity. Incoming client requests arrive at the load balancer and must be efficiently distributed among the available servers to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

The load balancer operates under the following constraints and requirements:

1.  **Dynamic Server Capacity:** Each backend server `i` has a current processing capacity `capacity[i]` representing the number of requests it can handle concurrently without exceeding its performance threshold. This capacity can fluctuate dynamically based on factors like CPU utilization, memory pressure, and network bandwidth. The `capacity` values are provided as an input array and are updated periodically.

2.  **Request Prioritization:** Client requests have varying priorities, represented by an integer value. Higher priority requests should be served before lower priority requests.  Requests with the same priority should be handled in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) manner.

3.  **Request Routing:** The load balancer must route each incoming request to a suitable backend server. A server is considered suitable if its current `capacity` is greater than zero. If no suitable server is available, the request must be queued until a server becomes available.

4.  **Fairness:** While prioritizing higher-priority requests, the load balancer must also ensure a degree of fairness to prevent starvation of lower-priority requests. A starvation threshold `S` is provided. If a lower-priority request has been waiting in the queue for longer than `S` time units, it should be promoted to a higher priority.

5.  **Real-time Performance:** The load balancer must process requests with minimal latency.  The routing decision for each request should be made within a strict time bound (e.g., milliseconds).  The system should handle a high volume of concurrent requests.

6.  **Scalability:** The load balancer should be designed to handle a large number of backend servers (up to 10,000) and a high request rate (up to 1,000,000 requests per second).

7.  **Fault Tolerance:**  (Implicit requirement) While not explicitly tested, your design should consider potential failure scenarios, such as server crashes or network disruptions. Your code should be robust and handle such scenarios gracefully.

8.  **Memory Constraints:** The load balancer operates under memory constraints. Avoid storing large amounts of data in memory unless absolutely necessary.

**Input:**

The load balancer receives the following inputs:

*   `N`: The number of backend servers (1 <= N <= 10,000).
*   `capacity`: An array of integers of size `N`, where `capacity[i]` represents the current processing capacity of server `i` (0 <= capacity[i] <= 1000).  This array is updated periodically.
*   `requestPriority`: An integer representing the priority of the incoming request (1 <= requestPriority <= 10). Higher values indicate higher priority.
*   `starvationThreshold`: An integer representing the starvation threshold `S` in time units.
*   `arrivalTime`: An integer representing the arrival time of the request.

**Output:**

The load balancer should output the index of the backend server to which the request is routed (0-indexed). If no server is currently available, the request should be queued, and the function should return -1. When a server becomes available for a queued request, the load balancer should route the request and return the server index.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a system handling online video streaming requests. Backend servers are responsible for encoding and streaming video content. Higher priority requests might come from premium subscribers or live events, while lower priority requests could be for on-demand content. The load balancer needs to efficiently distribute these requests while adhering to the given constraints.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** The load balancer must correctly route requests to available servers, respecting priority and fairness constraints.
*   **Performance:** The load balancer must handle a high request rate with minimal latency.
*   **Scalability:** The solution must be able to handle a large number of servers and requests.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Efficiency:** Algorithm efficiency, with emphasis on time and space complexity.

**Clarifications:**

*   Assume that the `capacity` array updates are infrequent compared to the request arrival rate.
*   You are responsible for implementing the core routing logic of the load balancer. You do not need to implement the server capacity monitoring or the request arrival mechanism.
*   You can use any standard Java data structures and algorithms.
*   Consider using thread-safe data structures to handle concurrent requests.

Good luck! This is designed to be a very challenging and open-ended problem. Your solution should be well-justified and documented.

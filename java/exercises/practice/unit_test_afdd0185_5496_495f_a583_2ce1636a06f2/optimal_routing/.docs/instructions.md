Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Java coding problem. Here's the problem description:

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. The connections between nodes are represented by a set of bidirectional links. Each link has a latency value associated with it, representing the time it takes for a message to travel across that link.

Your goal is to implement a system that can efficiently handle routing requests between any two nodes in the network, considering the following constraints:

1.  **Dynamic Network:** The network topology (nodes and links) can change dynamically. Links can be added or removed from the network at any time.
2.  **Latency Optimization:** The primary objective is to minimize the total latency for each routing path. Find the shortest path in terms of latency between the source and destination nodes.
3.  **Congestion Awareness:** Some nodes or links might experience congestion. Congestion increases the latency of affected links. Your algorithm should be able to adapt to these congestion changes and find alternative routes if necessary.  Congestion is represented by a congestion factor. The latency of a link is multiplied by its congestion factor (>= 1).
4.  **Real-time Updates:** The system must be able to process routing requests and network updates (link additions, removals, latency changes, congestion changes) in near real-time.  Assume a high volume of concurrent requests.
5.  **Scalability:** The solution must scale efficiently to handle a large number of nodes (up to 10<sup>5</sup>) and links (up to 10<sup>6</sup>) while maintaining acceptable performance.
6.  **Fault Tolerance:** If a node or link fails entirely (removed from the network), the system should still be able to find alternative routes between the remaining nodes.
7.  **Non-Negative Weights:** All latencies and congestion factors will be non-negative.
8.  **Multiple Optimal Paths:** If multiple paths have the same minimum latency, the algorithm can return any one of them.
9.  **No Path Available:** If no path exists between the source and destination nodes, return an empty path.

**Input:**

Your system will receive the following types of requests:

*   `addLink(node1, node2, latency)`: Adds a bidirectional link between `node1` and `node2` with the given `latency`. If the link already exists, update its latency.
*   `removeLink(node1, node2)`: Removes the link between `node1` and `node2`.
*   `updateLatency(node1, node2, latency)`: Updates the latency of the link between `node1` and `node2`.
*   `updateCongestion(node1, node2, congestionFactor)`: Updates the congestion factor of the link between `node1` and `node2`. Congestion Factor will always be >=1.
*   `findOptimalPath(source, destination)`: Finds the optimal (shortest latency) path between `source` and `destination` nodes. Returns a list of nodes representing the path or an empty list if no path exists. The path should *not* include the same node twice.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5` (Number of nodes)
*   `1 <= m <= 10^6` (Number of links)
*   `0 <= node1, node2, source, destination < n`
*   `1 <= latency <= 1000`
*   `1 <= congestionFactor <= 10`

**Requirements:**

*   Implement the system using Java.
*   Focus on algorithmic efficiency and data structure choices to meet the scalability and real-time update requirements.
*   Consider concurrency and thread-safety when handling multiple requests simultaneously.
*   Provide a clear and well-documented solution.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures (graph representation), algorithms (shortest path algorithms), and system design (concurrency, updates). Good luck!

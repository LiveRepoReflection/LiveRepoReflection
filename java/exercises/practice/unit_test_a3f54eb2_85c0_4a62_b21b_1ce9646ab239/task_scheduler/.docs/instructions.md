## Question Title:  Optimal Task Assignment with Dependencies and Deadlines

### Question Description

You are tasked with developing an efficient task management system for a large-scale distributed computing environment.  There are `n` tasks to be executed, and `m` worker nodes available to perform these tasks. Each worker node has a specific processing capability.

Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id_i`: A unique integer identifier.
*   `processing_time_i`:  The time it takes for a worker node with a processing capability of 1 to complete the task.  The actual time a worker node `j` takes to complete task `i` is `processing_time_i / capability_j`, where `capability_j` is the processing capability of worker node `j`.
*   `deadline_i`: A deadline by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies_i`: A list of `id`s of other tasks that must be completed before task `i` can start.  If `dependencies_i` is empty, the task can start immediately.

Your goal is to assign tasks to worker nodes and schedule their execution such that:

1.  All tasks are completed before their deadlines.
2.  The makespan (the time when the last task finishes executing) is minimized.
3.  Task dependencies are respected: a task can only start executing after all its dependencies are complete.
4.  Each worker can only execute one task at a time.

**Input:**

You are given the following inputs:

*   `tasks`:  A list of `Task` objects, where `Task` is defined as:

```java
class Task {
    int id;
    double processing_time;
    double deadline;
    List<Integer> dependencies; // List of task IDs
}
```

*   `workers`: A list of `Worker` objects, where `Worker` is defined as:

```java
class Worker {
    int id;
    double capability;
}
```

**Output:**

Return a `List<Assignment>` representing the optimal task assignment and schedule.  `Assignment` is defined as:

```java
class Assignment {
    int taskId;
    int workerId;
    double startTime;
    double endTime;
}
```

If it is impossible to complete all tasks before their deadlines while respecting dependencies, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000` (Number of tasks)
*   `1 <= m <= 100` (Number of worker nodes)
*   `0 < processing_time_i <= 1000`
*   `0 < deadline_i <= 10000`
*   `0 < capability_j <= 10`
*   Task IDs are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.
*   Dependencies are valid task IDs.
*   The graph of task dependencies is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the makespan.  Solutions that meet the deadline constraint but do not attempt to minimize the makespan will receive partial credit.  Solutions with a significantly larger makespan than the optimal solution may not pass all test cases.
*   The solution should have a time complexity better than O(n! \* m^n), where n is the number of tasks and m is the number of workers.  Brute-force approaches will not be efficient enough to pass all test cases.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty task list.
*   Empty worker list.
*   Tasks with no dependencies.
*   Tasks with circular dependencies (this should be handled as an invalid input and return an empty list, even though the constraint specifies a DAG).
*   Impossible scenarios where deadlines cannot be met with the given resources.
*   Worker capabilities that can lead to floating-point imprecision; handle appropriately.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly assign tasks to workers and schedule their execution while respecting dependencies and deadlines.
*   Makespan: The solution must minimize the makespan.
*   Efficiency: The solution must be efficient and meet the time complexity requirements.
*   Handling of edge cases: The solution must gracefully handle all specified edge cases.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using topological sorting to determine the order in which tasks can be executed.
*   Dynamic programming or greedy algorithms might be useful for optimizing task assignment.
*   Be mindful of floating-point precision issues when calculating completion times.
*   Consider using a priority queue to keep track of available worker nodes.

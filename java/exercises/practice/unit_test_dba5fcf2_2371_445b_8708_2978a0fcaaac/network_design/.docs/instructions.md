Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills:

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkPlacement`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing the backbone network for a new globally distributed cloud service. The service requires low latency communication between data centers to ensure data consistency and responsiveness. You are given a set of potential data center locations and the geographical distances between them.  Your goal is to select the *optimal* subset of data centers to establish the backbone network and determine the *optimal* connections between these selected data centers, minimizing both the number of selected data centers and the total latency (represented by the sum of distances of the network links).

Specifically:

1.  **Input:**
    *   `numDataCenters`: An integer representing the total number of potential data center locations (indexed from 0 to `numDataCenters - 1`).
    *   `distances`: A 2D array (matrix) of integers representing the geographical distances between data centers. `distances[i][j]` represents the distance between data center `i` and data center `j`.  The matrix is symmetric (i.e., `distances[i][j] == distances[j][i]`) and `distances[i][i] == 0`.
    *   `minConnectivity`: An integer representing the minimum number of *distinct* data centers each selected data center must be directly connected to in the final network. This ensures redundancy and fault tolerance.
    *   `maxLatency`: An integer representing the maximum acceptable sum of distances of the network links.

2.  **Output:**

    Return a `List<List<Integer>>` representing the *optimal* backbone network. Each inner `List<Integer>` represents a connection (edge) between two selected data centers, containing the indices of the connected data centers. The network must satisfy the following criteria:

    *   **Connectivity:** Each selected data center must have direct connections to at least `minConnectivity` *other* selected data centers.
    *   **Latency Constraint:** The sum of the distances of all connections in the returned network must be less than or equal to `maxLatency`.
    *   **Minimization:**
        *   Primary Goal: Minimize the number of data centers selected for the backbone network.
        *   Secondary Goal: Among all networks with the minimum number of data centers, minimize the total latency (sum of distances of the connections).

3.  **Constraints and Edge Cases:**

    *   `1 <= numDataCenters <= 50`
    *   `0 <= distances[i][j] <= 1000`
    *   `0 <= minConnectivity < numDataCenters`
    *   `0 <= maxLatency <= 100000`
    *   It is possible that no valid network configuration exists that satisfies the constraints. In this case, return an *empty* `List<List<Integer>>`.
    *   The input `distances` matrix will always be a valid square matrix with the properties described above.
    *   The same data center cannot appear multiple times in the same connection (e.g., `[1, 1]` is invalid).
    *   The order of data centers within a connection does not matter (e.g., `[1, 2]` is the same as `[2, 1]`).  Return each connection only once.
    *   The order of the connections in the returned `List<List<Integer>>` does not matter.
    *   The algorithm should be reasonably efficient, especially for larger values of `numDataCenters`. Brute force solutions that explore all possible subsets will likely time out.

4.  **Example:**

    ```java
    numDataCenters = 5
    distances = {
        {0, 10, 20, 30, 40},
        {10, 0, 15, 25, 35},
        {20, 15, 0, 12, 22},
        {30, 25, 12, 0, 18},
        {40, 35, 22, 18, 0}
    }
    minConnectivity = 2
    maxLatency = 100

    // One possible optimal solution (other valid solutions might exist):
    // [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
    // This network selects data centers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (4 data centers total)
    // Data center 1 is connected to 2 and 3 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 2 is connected to 1 and 3 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 3 is connected to 1, 2, and 4 (connectivity = 3)
    // Data center 4 is connected to 3 (connectivity = 1).  Since we need minConnectivity = 2, we must also add
    // Data center 4 is connected to another data center. Let's connect it to 1.
    // Total latency = 15 + 25 + 12 + 18 = 70 <= maxLatency

    //Another possible optimal solution (other valid solutions might exist):
    //[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2,4]]
    // Data center 1 is connected to 2 and 3 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 2 is connected to 1,3 and 4 (connectivity = 3)
    // Data center 3 is connected to 1,2 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 4 is connected to 2 (connectivity = 1).  Since we need minConnectivity = 2, we must also add
    // Data center 4 is connected to another data center. Let's connect it to 1.
    // Total latency = 15 + 25 + 12 + 35 = 87 <= maxLatency

    //Another possible optimal solution (other valid solutions might exist):
    //[[1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
    // Data center 1 is connected to 2 and 4 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 2 is connected to 1 and 4 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 3 is connected to 4 (connectivity = 1)
    // Data center 4 is connected to 1,2, and 3 (connectivity = 3).
    //Let's connect 3 to another node to fulfill connectivity requirement. Let's connect it to 2
    // Total latency = 15 + 35 + 35 + 12 + 15= 112 > maxLatency. This is an invalid solution

    //Another possible optimal solution (other valid solutions might exist):
    //[[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]]
    // This network selects data centers 0, 1, and 2 (3 data centers total)
    // Data center 0 is connected to 1 and 2 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 1 is connected to 0 and 2 (connectivity = 2)
    // Data center 2 is connected to 0 and 1 (connectivity = 2)
    // Total latency = 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 <= maxLatency. This is an optimal solution since it uses 3 data centers and the connectivity requirement is satisfied. It also meets the latency constraint.
    ```

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (finding connected components, checking connectivity), optimization techniques (potentially a branch-and-bound or dynamic programming approach to explore the search space efficiently), and careful handling of constraints and edge cases. Good luck!

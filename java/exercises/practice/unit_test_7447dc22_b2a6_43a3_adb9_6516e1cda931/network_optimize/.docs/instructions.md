## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal data distribution network for a large-scale content delivery system. The network consists of `n` servers interconnected by bidirectional communication channels. Each server holds a subset of content files. A client can request any file from any server within the network.

The goal is to minimize the average latency experienced by clients when requesting files. Latency is primarily determined by two factors:

1.  **Distance:** The number of hops (communication channels) a request must traverse to reach a server containing the requested file.
2.  **Server Load:** The number of concurrent requests a server is handling. Higher load results in increased processing time and latency.

Your task is to implement a function that determines the optimal distribution of content files across the servers to minimize the average latency, subject to the following constraints:

*   Each server has a limited storage capacity.  Content files have different sizes. The total size of files stored on a server cannot exceed its capacity.
*   There is a minimum required redundancy for each content file.  Each file must exist on at least `k` different servers to ensure availability in case of server failures.
*   The network topology is represented as an adjacency matrix, where `matrix[i][j]` represents the latency (in milliseconds) of the direct link between server `i` and server `j`. If there is no direct link, `matrix[i][j] = -1`. Assume `matrix[i][i] = 0`.
*   You are given a matrix `requests`, where `requests[i][0]` is the server making the request, and `requests[i][1]` is the ID of the requested file.

The input to your function will be:

*   `n`: The number of servers (numbered 0 to n-1).
*   `matrix`: An `n x n` adjacency matrix representing the network topology.
*   `serverCapacities`: An array of length `n`, where `serverCapacities[i]` is the storage capacity of server `i`.
*   `fileSizes`: An array where `fileSizes[i]` is the size of file `i`.
*   `k`: The minimum redundancy factor.
*   `requests`: A matrix where `requests[i][0]` is the requesting server, and `requests[i][1]` is the file requested.

Your function should return a matrix `distribution` of size (number of servers)x(number of files). `distribution[i][j] = 1` if server `i` contains file `j`, and `0` otherwise.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000` or `matrix[i][j] = -1`
*   `1 <= serverCapacities[i] <= 1000`
*   `1 <= fileSizes[i] <= 100`
*   `1 <= k <= n`
*   The number of files can be up to 100
*   The number of requests can be up to 10000

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the average latency across all requests.  Latency is the sum of the network latency (calculated based on the number of hops * link latencies) and the server load penalty.  Assume server load penalty is 1 ms for each concurrent request on that server.  If no server has the requested file, return null.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Network is disconnected.
*   No possible distribution satisfying the storage and redundancy constraints.
*   Some files are requested much more frequently than others.
*   The provided network contains cycles, necessitating consideration of the shortest path.

**Hint:** Consider using graph algorithms to calculate shortest paths, and optimization techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, or linear programming with relaxation) to find a near-optimal distribution.  Think about how to efficiently represent the search space and evaluate potential solutions.

Good luck!

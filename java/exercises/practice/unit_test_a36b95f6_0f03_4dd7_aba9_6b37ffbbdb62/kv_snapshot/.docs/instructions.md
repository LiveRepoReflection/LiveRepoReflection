Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be at the LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and a real-world inspired scenario:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Snapshot Isolation**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed, transactional key-value store. The store consists of multiple nodes (servers), and clients can perform read and write operations against it.  To ensure data consistency and prevent anomalies, the system must support snapshot isolation.

**System Requirements:**

1.  **Data Model:** The store holds key-value pairs, where both keys and values are strings.

2.  **Operations:** Clients can perform the following operations:
    *   `put(key, value)`: Writes the given value to the specified key.
    *   `get(key)`: Reads the value associated with the specified key.
    *   `begin_transaction()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique transaction ID.
    *   `commit_transaction(transaction_id)`: Attempts to commit the transaction with the given ID.
    *   `abort_transaction(transaction_id)`: Aborts the transaction with the given ID, discarding any changes.

3.  **Distribution:** The key-value data is distributed across multiple nodes. A simple consistent hashing scheme (or any other suitable distribution strategy) should be used to determine the node responsible for storing a given key. For simplicity, assume the number of nodes is fixed and known.

4.  **Snapshot Isolation:**  Each transaction operates on a consistent snapshot of the data.  A transaction, once started, sees a consistent view of the data as it existed at the beginning of that transaction, regardless of any concurrent writes by other transactions. This isolation level prevents phenomena such as non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

5.  **Concurrency:**  The system must handle concurrent transactions from multiple clients.

6.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should strive to remain available and consistent even if one or more nodes temporarily become unavailable (though a full implementation of fault tolerance is beyond the scope of this exercise; consider the impact of node failures in your design).

7.  **Scalability:** While not directly tested, your design should consider scalability. Think about how your design could be extended to handle a larger number of nodes and clients.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Efficiency:** `get` operations should be optimized for read performance.
*   **Atomicity:** All writes within a committed transaction must be applied atomically. Either all the writes are applied, or none of them are.
*   **Durability:**  Once a transaction is committed, the changes must be durable (though you don't need to implement full persistence to disk for this problem; in-memory durability is sufficient).
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Design a conflict resolution mechanism for concurrent transactions attempting to modify the same keys. (e.g., optimistic locking with retry, or pessimistic locking).
*   **Transaction ID Generation:** Provide a mechanism for generating unique transaction IDs.
*   **Node Communication:** You'll need to establish a mechanism for communication between nodes (e.g., using sockets or a simple RPC framework).

**Edge Cases:**

*   Handling node failures during transactions (though full recovery is not required).
*   Concurrent transactions modifying the same keys.
*   Transactions that span multiple nodes.
*   Large numbers of concurrent transactions.
*   Keys that do not exist.
*   Invalid transaction IDs.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Minimize the overhead of creating snapshots.
*   Optimize read performance by caching frequently accessed data.
*   Consider how to efficiently replicate data for fault tolerance (though a full replication scheme is not required).

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, data structures, and algorithms. Solving it effectively will involve careful design choices and trade-offs to meet the performance, consistency, and fault tolerance requirements. Good luck!

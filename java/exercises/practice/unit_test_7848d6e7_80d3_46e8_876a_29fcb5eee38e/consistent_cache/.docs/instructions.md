## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed, eventually consistent cache system. This system will consist of multiple cache nodes, and a client library that allows applications to interact with the cache. The goal is to provide a highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant caching solution for frequently accessed data.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Data Model:** The cache stores key-value pairs where keys are strings and values are arbitrary byte arrays.

2.  **Cache Nodes:** Each cache node is an independent server responsible for storing a subset of the cached data. The nodes are organized in a cluster, and the client library needs to be aware of the cluster topology.

3.  **Hashing and Data Distribution:** Implement a consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., using a ring-based approach or rendezvous hashing) to distribute data evenly across the cache nodes. This ensures that keys are mapped to specific nodes in a predictable way, even when nodes are added or removed.

4.  **Client Library:** Provide a client library that applications can use to interact with the cache. The client library should handle:
    *   **`get(key)`:** Retrieve the value associated with a given key. If the key is not found on the initially contacted node, the client library should automatically redirect the request to the appropriate node based on the consistent hashing algorithm. Return `null` if the key does not exist in the cache.
    *   **`put(key, value)`:** Store the given value under the provided key. The client library should determine the appropriate node and send the data to that node.

5.  **Eventual Consistency:** Implement an update strategy that ensures eventual consistency.
    *   When a `put` operation is performed, the data is initially written to the "primary" node responsible for that key.
    *   Asynchronously, replicate the data to `N` other nodes (replication factor), where `N` is a configurable parameter. This can be achieved using techniques like gossip protocol or a background synchronization process.
    *   During a `get` operation, if the data is not found, or is considered stale (based on a version number or timestamp), the client should attempt to retrieve the data from other replicas.

6.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to handle node failures gracefully.
    *   If a node is unavailable, the client library should automatically retry the operation on another replica.
    *   When a node fails, the consistent hashing algorithm should ensure that the data previously stored on that node is redistributed to other nodes in the cluster.

7.  **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale horizontally by adding more cache nodes to the cluster.

8.  **Concurrency:** The cache nodes should be able to handle concurrent read and write requests efficiently.

9.  **Monitoring:** Include basic monitoring capabilities to track metrics like cache hit rate, number of requests per second, and node health.

**Constraints:**

*   You cannot use any external caching libraries (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for the core caching logic. You can use libraries for networking, serialization, and other utility functions.
*   The system should be optimized for read-heavy workloads.
*   Consider thread safety and data consistency in a concurrent environment.
*   Assume the network is unreliable and prone to failures.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for automatic node discovery and cluster management.
*   Add support for cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU) to manage the cache size.
*   Implement a more sophisticated consistency model, such as causal consistency or read-your-writes consistency.
*   Provide an API to dynamically adjust the replication factor `N`.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. A well-designed solution should be robust, scalable, and performant. The challenge lies in balancing consistency, availability, and performance in a distributed environment. Good luck!

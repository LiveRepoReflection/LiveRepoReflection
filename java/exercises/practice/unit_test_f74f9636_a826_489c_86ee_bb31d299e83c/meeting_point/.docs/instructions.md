Okay, here's a challenging coding problem in Java, designed to be on par with LeetCode's "Hard" difficulty.  It combines graph algorithms, optimization, and a practical scenario with specific performance requirements.

**Project Name:** `OptimalMeetingPoint`

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are building a scheduling service for a large, distributed company. The company has employees located in various office buildings within a city. You're tasked with finding the optimal office building to host a company-wide meeting, minimizing the *total commute time* for all employees.

Each office building is represented as a node in a weighted, undirected graph. The edges represent roads connecting the buildings, and the weights represent the *estimated travel time* between those buildings. Not all buildings are directly connected.

Given:

1.  **`n`**: The number of office buildings, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
2.  **`edges`**: A 2D integer array where `edges[i] = [buildingA, buildingB, travelTime]` indicates a road exists between buildings `buildingA` and `buildingB` with the given `travelTime`.
3.  **`employeeLocations`**: An integer array where `employeeLocations[i]` represents the building number where employee `i` is located.  Multiple employees can be located in the same building.
4.  **`maxTravelTime`**: An integer representing the *maximum acceptable total commute time* for the meeting. If the minimum possible total commute time exceeds this limit, return `-1`.

Your task is to write a function that finds the optimal meeting building (i.e., the building that minimizes the total commute time for all employees) and returns its building number.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Connectivity:** The graph representing the city might not be fully connected. If some employees cannot reach certain buildings, those buildings are not viable meeting locations. You must handle disconnected components.
*   **Optimization:** Your solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of buildings (`n <= 500`) and employees (number of employees <= 1000).  Naive solutions with high time complexity will likely time out.  Consider using efficient graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall.
*   **Tie-breaking:** If multiple buildings result in the same minimum total commute time, return the building with the *smallest building number*.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle the case where the graph is empty (`n = 0` or `edges` is empty).
    *   Handle the case where an employee location is invalid (e.g., `employeeLocations[i]` is outside the range `[0, n-1]`).
    *   Handle disconnected graphs where no valid meeting location can be found within the `maxTravelTime`.
*   **Total Commute Time Calculation:** The total commute time is the sum of the shortest travel times from each employee's location to the meeting building.
*   **Valid Meeting Location:** A building is considered a valid meeting location only if *all* employees can reach it.

**Example:**

```
n = 4
edges = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 5], [1, 2, 2], [1, 3, 1]]
employeeLocations = [0, 1, 2, 3]
maxTravelTime = 10

Output: 1

Explanation:
- Building 0: 0 + 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
- Building 1: 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Building 2: 5 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 9
- Building 3: 3 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 6 //Note, the shortest path from building 0 to building 3 is 0->1->3 = 1+1=2 instead of infinity

Building 1 has the minimum total commute time (4).

```

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and efficient coding practices to pass all test cases within the time constraints. Good luck!

## Problem: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Resource Constraints

**Description:**

You are designing a task scheduling system for a high-performance computing cluster. There are `N` tasks that need to be executed. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id_i`: A unique integer identifier for the task (1 <= `id_i` <= N).
*   `duration_i`: The time in seconds required to execute the task.
*   `dependencies_i`: A list of task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start.
*   `resource_requirements_i`: A list of resource types and amounts required by the task. For example, `[["CPU", 4], ["GPU", 1], ["RAM", 8]]` indicates the task requires 4 CPU cores, 1 GPU, and 8 GB of RAM.

The computing cluster has a limited set of resources:

*   `available_resources`: A list of resource types and amounts available in the cluster. For example, `[["CPU", 32], ["GPU", 8], ["RAM", 128]]` indicates the cluster has 32 CPU cores, 8 GPUs, and 128 GB of RAM.

Your goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan (the total time to complete all tasks) while respecting dependencies and resource constraints.  The schedule should specify the start time for each task.

**Input:**

*   `tasks`: A list of task objects, where each task object has the properties `id`, `duration`, `dependencies`, and `resource_requirements` as described above.
*   `available_resources`: A list of resource types and amounts available in the cluster.

**Output:**

A Map (Dictionary) where the key is `id_i` of the task and the value is the start time of the task. If no feasible schedule exists, return an empty Map (Dictionary).

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Dependencies:** A task cannot start until all its dependencies are completed.
*   **Resource Constraints:**  Tasks can only run concurrently if the total resource requirements of the running tasks do not exceed the `available_resources`. A task utilizes the resources from its start time until `duration_i` after start time.
*   **Optimization:** The primary objective is to minimize the makespan (the completion time of the last task to finish).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle cases with circular dependencies (return an empty map).
    *   Handle cases where the resource requirements of a single task exceed the `available_resources` (return an empty map).
    *   Handle cases where no feasible schedule exists due to dependencies and resource limitations (return an empty map).
*   **Efficiency:** The number of tasks `N` can be up to 1000. Therefore, an efficient algorithm is crucial.  Brute-force approaches will likely timeout.
*   **Concurrency:** Multiple tasks can run concurrently as long as resource constraints are met.
*   **Tie-breaking:** If multiple tasks are ready to run and resources are available, prioritize tasks with the longest duration first.
*   **Real-world Scenario:** This problem models the complexities of scheduling jobs in distributed computing environments.

This question assesses your ability to combine data structures (graphs for dependencies, priority queues for task selection), graph algorithms (topological sort), resource management, and optimization techniques to solve a complex scheduling problem.

## Question: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

**Problem Description:**

You are managing a complex project consisting of `N` tasks. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id_i`: A unique integer identifier.
*   `duration_i`: The time (in arbitrary units) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline_i`: The latest time (in the same units as duration) by which the task must be finished.
*   `dependencies_i`: A list of `id`s of other tasks that must be completed before task `i` can start. A task cannot start until all its dependencies are finished.

Your goal is to find a valid schedule for completing all `N` tasks that minimizes the maximum lateness of any task. Lateness of a task is defined as `completion_time - deadline_i`. If `completion_time < deadline_i`, then `lateness` is negative, and if `completion_time > deadline_i`, then `lateness` is positive. The goal is to minimize the *maximum* lateness across all tasks.

**Input:**

A list of `N` tasks, where each task is represented by a `Task` object or a similar data structure containing the fields `id`, `duration`, `deadline`, and `dependencies`. Assume task `id`s are integers from `0` to `N-1`.

**Constraints:**

1.  The number of tasks `N` can be up to 10<sup>5</sup>.
2.  Task durations can range from 1 to 10<sup>4</sup>.
3.  Task deadlines can range from 1 to 10<sup>9</sup>.
4.  The dependency graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It is guaranteed that no circular dependencies exist.
5.  Multiple tasks can be executed in parallel, assuming their dependencies are met.
6.  The tasks are non-preemptive, meaning once a task starts, it must run to completion without interruption.
7.  If there are multiple schedules that result in the same minimum maximum lateness, any of these schedules is acceptable.
8. If it is impossible to complete all tasks before their deadlines, return `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (or a similar large value to indicate failure).

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum possible maximum lateness among all tasks in a valid schedule.

**Example:**

```
Tasks = [
    Task(id=0, duration=5, deadline=10, dependencies=[]),
    Task(id=1, duration=3, deadline=15, dependencies=[0]),
    Task(id=2, duration=7, deadline=20, dependencies=[1]),
    Task(id=3, duration=2, deadline=12, dependencies=[0])
]
```

One possible schedule:

*   Task 0: Starts at 0, finishes at 5.
*   Task 3: Starts at 5, finishes at 7.
*   Task 1: Starts at 5, finishes at 8.
*   Task 2: Starts at 8, finishes at 15.

Latenesses:

*   Task 0: 5 - 10 = -5
*   Task 1: 8 - 15 = -7
*   Task 2: 15 - 20 = -5
*   Task 3: 7 - 12 = -5

Maximum lateness: -5

Another possible schedule:

*   Task 0: Starts at 0, finishes at 5.
*   Task 1: Starts at 5, finishes at 8.
*   Task 3: Starts at 8, finishes at 10.
*   Task 2: Starts at 8, finishes at 15.

Latenesses:

*   Task 0: 5 - 10 = -5
*   Task 1: 8 - 15 = -7
*   Task 2: 15 - 20 = -5
*   Task 3: 10 - 12 = -2

Maximum lateness: -2

Therefore, the output should be -2.

**Challenge:**

This problem requires a combination of topological sorting, dependency management, and careful scheduling to minimize the maximum lateness. Efficient algorithms and data structures are crucial to handle the large input size within reasonable time and space constraints. Consider different scheduling strategies and how they affect the maximum lateness. The need to minimize the *maximum* lateness, rather than the sum of latenesses, adds complexity.

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to test a candidate's understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design considerations.

**Problem: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store with Snapshot Isolation**

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed, in-memory key-value store. The store must support atomic transactions across multiple nodes and provide snapshot isolation.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Data Storage:** Implement an in-memory key-value store.  Assume keys and values are strings.

2.  **Distributed Architecture:**  Simulate a distributed environment with a configurable number of nodes. Each node is responsible for storing a subset of the data (you can use a simple consistent hashing scheme for key distribution - modulo the number of nodes by hashcode of the key).

3.  **Transactions:** Implement ACID-compliant transactions.  A transaction can involve read and write operations on multiple keys, potentially across different nodes.

4.  **Snapshot Isolation:**  Guarantee that each transaction operates on a consistent snapshot of the data.  This means that a transaction should not see any changes made by concurrent transactions.  Implement a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) mechanism to achieve this. Each transaction should be assigned a timestamp.

5.  **Atomic Commit:** Ensure that transactions either commit completely or roll back entirely.  Implement a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol for distributed transactions. You need to designate one node as the coordinator.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **No External Database:**  The entire solution must be implemented in-memory.
*   **Concurrency:**  The system must handle multiple concurrent transactions.
*   **Node Failures:**  Consider the possibility of node failures during the two-phase commit process. How would you handle in-flight transactions if a node acting as the coordinator fails? (You don't need to fully implement failure recovery, but describe your approach in comments).
*   **Timestamp Generation:**  Implement a mechanism for generating unique, monotonically increasing timestamps across the distributed system.  Consider potential clock skew issues between nodes. (Lamport timestamps are acceptable).
*   **Memory Management:** Since this is an in-memory store, consider memory usage, particularly with MVCC.  Implement a mechanism to garbage collect older versions of data that are no longer needed by active transactions (e.g., a background process that removes versions older than the oldest active transaction's start timestamp). This background job could for example be executed every 10 seconds.
*   **Transaction Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for transactions. If a transaction takes longer than a specified timeout, it should be automatically rolled back.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Read Performance:** Optimize for read performance.  Reads should be as fast as possible while still maintaining snapshot isolation.
*   **Minimize Lock Contention:** Design the system to minimize lock contention between concurrent transactions.

**Input/Output:**

The system should expose a simple API (e.g., methods like `begin_transaction()`, `read(key)`, `write(key, value)`, `commit_transaction()`, `rollback_transaction()`).  You can define the exact API based on your design.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:**  Does the system correctly implement ACID properties and snapshot isolation?
*   **Performance:**  How well does the system perform under concurrent workloads?
*   **Scalability:** While you can't fully test scalability in a single-machine simulation, how well does your design scale to a larger number of nodes? Justify your design choices.
*   **Code Quality:**  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Handling of Edge Cases:** Does the code appropriately handle all specified constraints and edge cases?

This problem is deliberately open-ended. There are many possible solutions with different trade-offs. The goal is to assess the candidate's ability to design a complex distributed system, understand the challenges of concurrency and data consistency, and make informed engineering decisions.

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard difficulty:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Task Scheduler with Priority and Deadlock Avoidance

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a distributed task scheduler for a system where multiple worker nodes can execute tasks. The system comprises a central scheduler and several worker nodes. The scheduler is responsible for assigning tasks to workers, considering task dependencies, priorities, and the avoidance of deadlocks.

Each task is represented by a unique ID (integer), a priority (integer, higher value indicates higher priority), a list of dependencies (task IDs that must be completed before this task can start), and an estimated execution time (integer).

The worker nodes have limited resources. For simplicity, assume each worker has a single execution slot, meaning it can only execute one task at a time.

**Your goal is to implement a scheduler that:**

1.  **Prioritizes Task Execution:**  Assigns tasks to workers based on their priority. Higher-priority tasks should be scheduled before lower-priority tasks, subject to dependency constraints.
2.  **Manages Task Dependencies:** Ensures that a task is only assigned to a worker when all its dependencies have been completed.
3.  **Avoids Deadlocks:** Prevents circular dependencies from causing the system to stall indefinitely. Your scheduler must detect and handle potential deadlocks. If a deadlock is detected, the scheduler should identify the lowest priority task involved in the deadlock cycle and remove its dependency to break the cycle (it should log which dependency was removed). If multiple tasks have the same lowest priority, remove the dependency of the task with the smallest ID.
4.  **Maximizes Worker Utilization:** Aims to keep workers busy as much as possible, minimizing idle time.
5.  **Handles Task Failures:**  Simulate task failures.  If a task fails on a worker, the scheduler should reschedule the task, potentially on a different worker. Assume a task can fail at most a fixed number of times (`MAX_RETRIES`). After exceeding the maximum retries, the task is considered failed and should be logged.
6.  **Scalability:** The scheduler should be designed to handle a large number of tasks and workers efficiently.

**Input:**

*   `tasks`: A list of `Task` objects. Each `Task` object has the following attributes:
    *   `id`: Integer, unique task ID.
    *   `priority`: Integer, task priority (higher is better).
    *   `dependencies`: A list of Integer, task IDs that must be completed before this task can start.
    *   `executionTime`: Integer, estimated execution time for the task.
*   `numWorkers`: Integer, the number of worker nodes available.
*   `MAX_RETRIES`: Integer, the maximum number of retries allowed for a failed task.

**Output:**

A list of `ScheduledTask` objects, representing the schedule generated by the scheduler.  Each `ScheduledTask` object should contain:

*   `taskId`: Integer, the ID of the task.
*   `workerId`: Integer, the ID of the worker node assigned to the task (0-indexed).
*   `startTime`: Integer, the time at which the task starts execution.
*   `endTime`: Integer, the time at which the task completes execution.
*   `status`: String, status of the task, should be "SUCCESS", "FAILED".

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** Your scheduler should be designed for efficiency, especially when dealing with a large number of tasks and dependencies. Consider the time and space complexity of your algorithms. Aim for a solution that scales well.
*   **Real-time Simulation:**  The scheduler operates in discrete time units (integers).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, especially for deadlock detection and task failures.  Log errors appropriately.
*   **Concurrency:**  While you don't need to implement actual multi-threading, your design should be concurrency-aware, meaning it should be structured in a way that could be easily parallelized if needed. Think about how you would handle locking and synchronization if the scheduler were truly multi-threaded.
*   **Testability:**  Your code should be well-structured and easy to test.
*   **Modularity:** Design your solution with modularity in mind, making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones.
*   Assume task execution is non-preemptive. Once a task starts on a worker, it runs to completion (or failure).

**Example:**

Let's say you have 3 tasks:

*   Task 1: id=1, priority=2, dependencies=[], executionTime=5
*   Task 2: id=2, priority=1, dependencies=[1], executionTime=3
*   Task 3: id=3, priority=3, dependencies=[2], executionTime=2

And you have 2 workers.

A possible valid schedule could be:

*   Task 1: worker=0, startTime=0, endTime=5, status="SUCCESS"
*   Task 3: worker=1, startTime=0, endTime=2, status="SUCCESS"
*   Task 2: worker=0, startTime=5, endTime=8, status="SUCCESS"

**This problem challenges you to design a sophisticated task scheduler that addresses several real-world concerns in distributed systems.  It requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles.** Good luck!

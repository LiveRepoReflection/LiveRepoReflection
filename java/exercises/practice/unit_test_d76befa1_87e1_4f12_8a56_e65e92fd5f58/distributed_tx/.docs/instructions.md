Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be similar in difficulty to a LeetCode Hard problem, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization, and real-world considerations.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture. Imagine a system where multiple independent services (databases, message queues, external APIs, etc.) need to participate in a single atomic transaction.  If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participating services.

Your DTC implementation should support the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.  The coordinator will manage the transaction lifecycle, ensuring atomicity and consistency across the distributed system.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Services Representation:**
    *   Represent each participating service as a `Service` interface with `prepare()` and `commit()`/`rollback()` methods.
    *   `prepare()`:  Each service attempts to perform its part of the transaction and returns a boolean indicating success or failure.  The service *must* be able to undo any changes made during `prepare()` if a rollback is later requested.
    *   `commit()`:  The service permanently applies the changes prepared in the `prepare()` phase.  This *must* always succeed.
    *   `rollback()`: The service undoes any changes made during the `prepare()` phase.

    ```java
    interface Service {
        boolean prepare(TransactionContext context); //Context to pass around any necessary info
        void commit(TransactionContext context);
        void rollback(TransactionContext context);
    }

    class TransactionContext {
        // Add any necessary information relevant to the transaction,
        // such as transaction ID, service-specific data, etc.
        private final String transactionId;
        private final Map<String, Object> serviceData = new HashMap<>();

        public TransactionContext(String transactionId) {
            this.transactionId = transactionId;
        }

        public String getTransactionId() {
            return transactionId;
        }

        public void addServiceData(String serviceName, Object data) {
            serviceData.put(serviceName, data);
        }

        public Object getServiceData(String serviceName) {
            return serviceData.get(serviceName);
        }

        //Consider proper immutability and thread safety if needed
    }
    ```

2.  **Transaction Coordinator:**
    *   Implement a `TransactionCoordinator` class with `begin()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods.
    *   `begin()`: Starts a new transaction, assigning it a unique ID.
    *   `commit(List<Service> services, TransactionContext context)`: Executes the 2PC protocol.
        *   First, invoke `prepare()` on all services.  If *any* `prepare()` call fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back.
        *   If all `prepare()` calls succeed, invoke `commit()` on all services.
    *   `rollback(List<Service> services, TransactionContext context)`: Rolls back the transaction by invoking `rollback()` on all services.
    *   **Concurrency:** The Transaction Coordinator must be thread-safe, allowing multiple transactions to be processed concurrently.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
    *   **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for `prepare()` calls. If a service doesn't respond within a specified time (e.g., 5 seconds), consider the `prepare()` call a failure and initiate a rollback.
    *   **Idempotency:** Design your system so that `commit()` and `rollback()` can be called multiple times without adverse effects.  This is crucial for handling failures and retries.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:**
    *   Simulate service failures.  Introduce the possibility that a `Service` might throw an exception during `prepare()`, `commit()`, or `rollback()`.  The DTC must handle these exceptions gracefully.  Retry failed `commit()` and `rollback()` operations a reasonable number of times (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff).

4.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   Include logging throughout the DTC to track transaction progress, service responses, and any errors encountered.  Use a logging framework like SLF4J.
    *   Implement basic metrics to track the number of successful and failed transactions.

5.  **Optimization:**
    *   `prepare()` calls can be executed in parallel to reduce overall transaction time.
    *   Minimize resource contention by using efficient data structures and synchronization techniques.
6.  **Testing Scenarios:**
    *   Transactions that succeed completely.
    *   Transactions that fail during the `prepare()` phase.
    *   Transactions that fail during the `commit()` phase (and require retry).
    *   Transactions that fail during the `rollback()` phase (and require retry).
    *   Concurrent transactions.
    *   Services that become unavailable during the transaction lifecycle (simulating network partitions).

**Constraints:**

*   **Language:** Java
*   **External Libraries:**  You can use common libraries like SLF4J for logging and JUnit for testing.  Avoid using heavy frameworks (e.g., Spring) to keep the focus on the core logic.
*   **Focus:** The primary focus is on the correctness and robustness of the DTC implementation.  Performance is a secondary consideration, but the solution should be reasonably efficient.
*   **Error Handling:**  Properly handle all exceptions and log errors.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the DTC correctly implement the 2PC protocol, ensuring atomicity and consistency?
*   **Robustness:** Can the DTC handle service failures, timeouts, and concurrent transactions gracefully?
*   **Thread Safety:** Is the DTC thread-safe, preventing race conditions?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the DTC reasonably efficient in terms of resource utilization and transaction processing time?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Testing:** Are there comprehensive unit tests covering various scenarios?
*   **Idempotency:** Can commit and rollback be safely retried?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling.  It's designed to be challenging and requires careful design and implementation.  Good luck!

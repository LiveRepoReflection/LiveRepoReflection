Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines**

**Problem Description:**

You are given a set of `N` tasks that need to be scheduled for execution on a single processor. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id[i]`: A unique integer identifier for the task.
*   `duration[i]`: The time (in arbitrary units) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline[i]`: The time by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task `id`s that must be completed before task `i` can start. A task cannot begin execution until all its dependencies are satisfied.
*   `priority[i]`: represents the priority of the task. Higher values means higher priority.

Your goal is to determine a schedule that maximizes the *total priority* of completed tasks while respecting all dependencies and deadlines. A task is considered completed if it finishes executing before or at its deadline. If a task doesn't meet its deadline, it's *not* considered completed, even if partially executed.

**Input:**

The input is provided as a list of tasks. Each task is represented by the following information:
* `N`: The total number of tasks.
* `id`: An array of N integers, the id of each task.
* `duration`: An array of N integers, the duration of each task.
* `deadline`: An array of N integers, the deadline of each task.
* `dependencies`: A 2D array of N lists, where each list contains the ids of the dependencies for the corresponding task.
* `priority`: An array of N integers, the priority of each task.

**Output:**

Your function should return an *ordered* list of task `id`s representing the optimal schedule. The order of tasks in the list defines the execution order. If no schedule is possible that can complete at least one task, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 5000`
*   `1 <= duration[i] <= 100`
*   `1 <= deadline[i] <= 10000`
*   `0 <= priority[i] <= 1000`
*   Dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). No circular dependencies exist.
*   Multiple tasks can share dependencies.
*   The task IDs will be unique and in the range [0, N-1].

**Requirements:**

*   **Correctness:** The schedule must respect all task dependencies and deadlines.
*   **Optimality:** The schedule should maximize the total priority of completed tasks.
*   **Efficiency:**  Your solution should aim for the best possible time complexity. Naive solutions will likely time out. Consider the use of appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no schedule is possible, where some tasks cannot be completed within their deadlines, and where dependencies are complex.
*   **Tie Breaking:** If multiple schedules achieve the same maximum priority, prefer the schedule that executes tasks with earlier deadlines first (Earliest Deadline First tiebreaker). If deadlines are also the same, prefer the schedule that executes tasks with higher id first.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
id = [0, 1, 2, 3]
duration = [5, 5, 3, 2]
deadline = [10, 12, 8, 20]
dependencies = [[], [0], [0], [1, 2]]
priority = [10, 5, 8, 3]
```

One possible optimal schedule is `[0, 2, 1, 3]`.

*   Task 0: Starts at 0, finishes at 5 (priority 10)
*   Task 2: Starts at 5, finishes at 8 (priority 8)
*   Task 1: Starts at 8, finishes at 13 (priority 0, missed deadline)
*   Task 3: Starts at 13, finishes at 15 (priority 3)
Total priority = 10 + 8 + 3 = 21

Another possible schedule is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

*   Task 0: Starts at 0, finishes at 5 (priority 10)
*   Task 1: Starts at 5, finishes at 10 (priority 5)
*   Task 2: Starts at 10, finishes at 13 (priority 0, missed deadline)
*   Task 3: Starts at 13, finishes at 15 (priority 3)
Total priority = 10 + 5 + 3 = 18

The schedule `[0, 2, 1, 3]` has the maximum total priority.

```
N = 3
id = [0, 1, 2]
duration = [2, 3, 4]
deadline = [5, 4, 6]
dependencies = [[], [0], [0]]
priority = [1, 2, 3]
```

One possible optimal schedule is `[0, 1, 2]`.

*   Task 0: Starts at 0, finishes at 2 (priority 1)
*   Task 1: Starts at 2, finishes at 5 (priority 0, missed deadline)
*   Task 2: Starts at 5, finishes at 9 (priority 0, missed deadline)
Total priority = 1

Another possible optimal schedule is `[0, 2, 1]`.

*   Task 0: Starts at 0, finishes at 2 (priority 1)
*   Task 2: Starts at 2, finishes at 6 (priority 3)
*   Task 1: Starts at 6, finishes at 9 (priority 0, missed deadline)
Total priority = 1 + 3 = 4

This problem requires a combination of topological sorting, dynamic programming (or a similar optimization technique), and careful handling of constraints and edge cases to achieve the optimal solution. Good luck!

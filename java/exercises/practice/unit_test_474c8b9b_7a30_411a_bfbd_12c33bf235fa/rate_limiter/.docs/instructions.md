## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter. This system must be able to handle a very high volume of requests across a cluster of servers, ensuring that no single user or IP address exceeds a predefined rate limit.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a popular online service (e.g., a REST API, a social network, or a microservice architecture). To protect your infrastructure from abuse (e.g., denial-of-service attacks, brute-force attempts), you need a robust and scalable rate limiting solution. Your system must be able to:

1.  **Identify Users/IPs:** Differentiate requests based on a unique identifier (e.g., user ID, IP address, API key).
2.  **Enforce Limits:** Allow a specific number of requests within a given time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user).
3.  **Handle Distributed Environment:** Work correctly across multiple servers, where requests from the same user might hit different servers.
4.  **Be Highly Available:** Minimize downtime and ensure that rate limiting continues to function even if some components fail.
5.  **Optimize for Performance:** Add minimal latency to each request. High throughput and low response times are critical.
6.  **Provide near real time synchronization:** Ensure the rate limit counter is updated as soon as possible

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **Rate Limit Configuration:** The rate limit (requests per time window) and the time window itself (seconds, minutes, hours) should be configurable. The configuration should be able to be updated without restarting the service.
*   **Data Storage:** Choose an appropriate data store for tracking request counts. Consider trade-offs between speed, consistency, and scalability.
*   **Concurrency:** Handle concurrent requests efficiently.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Design the system to gracefully handle failures of individual servers or data store nodes.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increasing traffic.
*   **Throttling:** When a rate limit is exceeded, the system should return a specific error response (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests). The response should include information about when the rate limit will reset (e.g., using the `Retry-After` header).

**Constraints:**

*   **No Global Lock:** Avoid using a single global lock for incrementing request counts, as this will become a bottleneck.
*   **Minimize External Dependencies:** While using external services like Redis or Memcached is allowed (and even encouraged), minimize the number of dependencies to simplify deployment and maintenance.
*   **Memory Considerations:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of users or IP addresses. Consider using techniques like eviction or sampling to manage memory consumption.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   **Dynamic Rate Limiting:** Implement the ability to dynamically adjust rate limits based on system load or other factors (e.g., different rate limits for different API endpoints).
*   **Tiered Rate Limiting:** Support different rate limits for different user tiers (e.g., free vs. paid users).
*   **Sliding Window Rate Limiting:** Implement a sliding window algorithm for more accurate rate limiting, rather than using fixed-size time windows.
*   **Integration with existing application:** Explain how this rate limiter can be integrated into a real application
*   **Explain how to monitor the rate limiter:** Explain how to monitor the rate limiter to ensure it is working correctly.

This problem requires careful consideration of distributed systems principles, data structures, algorithms, and performance optimization. It challenges the solver to design a practical and scalable solution for a common real-world problem. Good luck!

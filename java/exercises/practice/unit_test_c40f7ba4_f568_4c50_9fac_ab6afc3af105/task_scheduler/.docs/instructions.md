Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question, incorporating advanced data structures, intricate constraints, and optimization requirements.

## Project Name

`OptimalTaskScheduler`

## Question Description

You are designing a task scheduler for a high-throughput system.  There are `N` tasks to be executed. Each task `i` has a deadline `D_i`, a required execution time `T_i`, and a penalty `P_i` if it is not completed by its deadline. You have a single processor to execute these tasks.

The scheduler must determine an execution order of the tasks to minimize the total penalty incurred.  However, due to the nature of the system, tasks can be preempted (i.e., execution can be paused and resumed later).

**Input:**

*   An array of `N` integers representing the deadlines (`D`). `D[i]` is the deadline for task `i`.
*   An array of `N` integers representing the execution times (`T`). `T[i]` is the execution time for task `i`.
*   An array of `N` integers representing the penalties (`P`). `P[i]` is the penalty for task `i`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= D[i], T[i], P[i] <= 10^9` (Representing time units or currency)
*   All inputs will be valid (no negative values, array lengths match, etc.)
*   The system must handle potential integer overflow issues.

**Output:**

*   Return the minimum total penalty that can be achieved by optimally scheduling the tasks.

**Optimization Requirements & Considerations:**

*   **Time Complexity:** Solutions exceeding O(N log N) are unlikely to pass all test cases.
*   **Memory Complexity:**  Solutions should be memory-efficient.  Excessive memory usage may lead to termination.
*   **Preemption:** You *can* pause a task and resume it later.  This is key to optimization.
*   **Overflow:** Total penalty can be large, use long type appropriately.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider cases with identical deadlines, very short tasks, very long tasks, and tasks with zero penalty.
*   **Practical Scenario:**  Imagine a system managing resource allocation, financial transactions, or real-time data processing where missing deadlines incurs significant costs.

**Example:**

```
D = [2, 4, 2, 1]
T = [3, 2, 1, 4]
P = [4, 5, 2, 7]

Optimal Schedule (one possible):
1. Execute task 3 (T=1, P=2) - Completes at time 1, meets deadline (D=2).
2. Execute task 4 (T=4, P=7) - Completes at time 5, misses deadline (D=1), penalty = 7 if task 4 done at the end.
3. Execute task 1 (T=3, P=4) - Completes at time 8, misses deadline (D=2), penalty = 4 if task 1 done at the end.
4. Execute task 2 (T=2, P=5) - Completes at time 10, misses deadline (D=4), penalty = 5 if task 2 done at the end.

Total Penalty = 0  (tasks 3 complete) + 7+4+5 = 16

Another possible schedule:
1. Execute task 4 (T=4, P=7) - Completes at time 4, misses deadline (D=1), penalty = 7 if task 4 is never done.
2. Execute task 3 (T=1, P=2) - Completes at time 5, misses deadline (D=2), penalty = 2 if task 3 is never done.
3. Execute task 1 (T=3, P=4) - Completes at time 8, misses deadline (D=2), penalty = 4 if task 1 is never done.
4. Execute task 2 (T=2, P=5) - Completes at time 10, misses deadline (D=4), penalty = 5 if task 2 is never done.

Optimal Penalty = 11. (Complete task 1(4),2(5), and 3(2) after the deadline and no completing task 4(7))
```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness (passing all test cases)
*   Time complexity (O(N log N) or better)
*   Memory efficiency
*   Handling of edge cases
*   Code clarity and readability

This problem challenges the solver to think about greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, or a combination of approaches to find the optimal task scheduling strategy under preemption. It also requires careful attention to data structures and potential overflow issues. Good luck!

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture. The system consists of multiple independent services, each managing its own data. To ensure data consistency across these services, you need to implement a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol orchestrated by the DTC.

**Services:**

Assume you have `N` services (where `N` can be a large number) participating in a transaction. Each service exposes an API with the following functionalities:

*   `prepare(transactionId)`:  Attempts to tentatively apply the changes associated with the transaction. Returns `true` if prepared successfully, `false` otherwise (e.g., due to data validation failure, resource contention, or service unavailability).
*   `commit(transactionId)`:  Permanently applies the changes associated with the transaction. Assumed to always succeed if the `prepare` phase was successful.
*   `rollback(transactionId)`: Reverts any changes made during the `prepare` phase.

**DTC Responsibilities:**

The DTC must coordinate the transaction across all participating services.  It must:

1.  **Assign a unique transaction ID** to each new transaction.
2.  **Initiate the "prepare" phase** by sending `prepare(transactionId)` requests to all participating services.
3.  **Collect the responses** from all services.
4.  **If all services successfully prepared**, initiate the "commit" phase by sending `commit(transactionId)` requests to all services.
5.  **If any service failed to prepare**, initiate the "rollback" phase by sending `rollback(transactionId)` requests to all services.
6.  **Handle service failures** during the prepare, commit, or rollback phases.  Specifically, the system should remain consistent even if some services become temporarily unavailable.
7.  **Provide a mechanism for transaction status monitoring.** Allow external clients to query the status of a particular transaction (e.g., "preparing", "committed", "rolled back", "failed").

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The DTC must handle a large number of concurrent transactions and a large number of participating services.  Consider the performance implications of your design.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The DTC itself must be resilient to failures.  Consider how to prevent a single point of failure.
*   **Idempotency:** The `commit` and `rollback` operations on the services must be idempotent. This ensures that re-sending these operations in case of network failures does not lead to unintended side effects.
*   **Concurrency:**  The DTC must handle concurrent transactions safely and efficiently. Avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
*   **Optimization:** Minimize the latency of the transaction commit/rollback process.  Consider techniques such as asynchronous communication and parallel processing.
*   **Data Consistency:**  The most crucial requirement is to ensure that all participating services either commit the transaction or rollback the transaction. Partial commits are unacceptable.
*   **Asynchronous Communication:**  Assume communication between the DTC and services is inherently asynchronous and potentially unreliable (message queues, etc.). Implement appropriate retry mechanisms and timeouts.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track transaction progress, detect failures, and provide insights into system performance.

**Deliverables:**

Design and implement the DTC in Java, focusing on the core logic for coordinating distributed transactions.  Provide clear explanations of your design choices, including:

*   Data structures used to track transaction state.
*   Concurrency control mechanisms employed.
*   Failure handling strategies.
*   Optimization techniques implemented.
*   Trade-offs considered in your design.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the implementation (ensuring data consistency).
*   Scalability and performance of the DTC.
*   Fault tolerance and resilience to failures.
*   Clarity and maintainability of the code.
*   Quality of the design documentation.

## Question: Optimized Network Partitioning for Data Locality

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an algorithm to partition a large distributed data processing network into smaller, isolated subnetworks. The goal is to minimize inter-subnetwork data transfer while adhering to strict capacity constraints within each subnetwork.

The network is represented as an undirected graph, where:

*   Nodes represent data processing units. Each node has a `dataSize` (in MB) and a `processingCapacity` (in CPU cores).
*   Edges represent data dependencies between processing units. Each edge has a `dataTransferSize` (in MB/s) indicating the rate of data transfer required between the connected nodes.

Your task is to write a function that partitions the network into `k` subnetworks (where `k` is a given parameter). The partitioning must satisfy the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity Constraint:** The sum of `dataSize` of all nodes within a subnetwork must not exceed a maximum allowed `subnetworkDataCapacity` (in MB). Similarly, the sum of `processingCapacity` of all nodes within a subnetwork must not exceed a maximum allowed `subnetworkProcessingCapacity` (in CPU cores).
2.  **Connectivity Constraint:** Each node must belong to exactly one subnetwork.
3.  **Optimization Goal:** Minimize the total inter-subnetwork data transfer. This is the sum of `dataTransferSize` for all edges that connect nodes belonging to different subnetworks.

**Input:**

*   `nodes`: A list of `Node` objects, where each `Node` has the following attributes:
    *   `id`: A unique integer identifier for the node.
    *   `dataSize`: An integer representing the data size of the node (in MB).
    *   `processingCapacity`: An integer representing the processing capacity of the node (in CPU cores).
*   `edges`: A list of `Edge` objects, where each `Edge` has the following attributes:
    *   `node1Id`: The ID of the first node connected by the edge.
    *   `node2Id`: The ID of the second node connected by the edge.
    *   `dataTransferSize`: An integer representing the data transfer size required between the two nodes (in MB/s).
*   `k`: An integer representing the desired number of subnetworks.
*   `subnetworkDataCapacity`: An integer representing the maximum allowed data capacity for each subnetwork (in MB).
*   `subnetworkProcessingCapacity`: An integer representing the maximum allowed processing capacity for each subnetwork (in CPU cores).

**Output:**

*   A dictionary (or Map) where keys are node IDs and values are the subnetwork ID (integers from 0 to k-1) to which the node belongs. If a valid partitioning is not possible, return `null`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Input:** The number of nodes and edges can be very large (e.g., up to 10,000 nodes and 100,000 edges).
*   **NP-Hardness:** The problem is NP-hard, so finding the absolute optimal solution might be computationally infeasible. Focus on developing a reasonably efficient heuristic algorithm that provides a good (but not necessarily optimal) solution.
*   **Multiple Valid Solutions:** There might be multiple valid partitionings. Your algorithm should aim to find one that minimizes the inter-subnetwork data transfer.
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases such as:
    *   `k = 1` (partitioning into a single subnetwork).
    *   `k` being close to the number of nodes (each subnetwork contains only a few nodes).
    *   The graph being disconnected.
    *   Nodes with very large `dataSize` or `processingCapacity` that might be difficult to fit into any subnetwork.
*   **Time Complexity:** Aim for a solution with a reasonable time complexity. Algorithms that scale well with the size of the network are preferred.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large graphs.

**Node and Edge class definitions (for reference):**

```java
class Node {
    public int id;
    public int dataSize;
    public int processingCapacity;

    public Node(int id, int dataSize, int processingCapacity) {
        this.id = id;
        this.dataSize = dataSize;
        this.processingCapacity = processingCapacity;
    }
}

class Edge {
    public int node1Id;
    public int node2Id;
    public int dataTransferSize;

    public Edge(int node1Id, int node2Id, int dataTransferSize) {
        this.node1Id = node1Id;
        this.node2Id = node2Id;
        this.dataTransferSize = dataTransferSize;
    }
}
```

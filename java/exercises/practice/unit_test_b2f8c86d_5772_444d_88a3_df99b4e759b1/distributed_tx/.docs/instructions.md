Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging, incorporating several of the elements you requested.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture. Imagine a scenario where multiple independent services (e.g., `InventoryService`, `PaymentService`, `ShippingService`) need to participate in a single atomic transaction.  If any service fails to complete its part of the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participating services.

Your task is to implement a `TransactionCoordinator` that orchestrates these distributed transactions using a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Service Registration:** Services need to be able to register with the `TransactionCoordinator`. Each service will be represented by an interface `TransactionalService` that defines `prepare()` and `commit()`/`rollback()` methods.
    *   `prepare()`:  This method is called by the coordinator to ask the service if it is ready to commit the transaction. The service should perform all necessary checks (e.g., sufficient inventory, valid payment details) and return a boolean indicating success (true) or failure (false).  This method *must not* actually commit any changes.
    *   `commit()`:  This method is called by the coordinator to instruct the service to permanently commit its changes.
    *   `rollback()`: This method is called by the coordinator to instruct the service to undo any changes made during the transaction.

2.  **Transaction Initiation:**  A client can initiate a transaction by calling the `startTransaction()` method on the `TransactionCoordinator`. This method should return a unique transaction ID.

3.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):**  The `TransactionCoordinator` must call the `prepare()` method on each registered service.  It should collect the results from all services. If *any* service returns `false` from `prepare()`, the coordinator should abort the transaction and proceed to the rollback phase.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback Phase):**
        *   If all services returned `true` from `prepare()`, the `TransactionCoordinator` must call the `commit()` method on each service.
        *   If any service returned `false` from `prepare()`, the `TransactionCoordinator` must call the `rollback()` method on each service.

4.  **Transaction Completion:** The `TransactionCoordinator` must provide methods `commitTransaction(transactionId)` and `rollbackTransaction(transactionId)` that clients can use to explicitly commit or rollback a transaction based on the transactionId.  These methods should only be used if the coordinator itself has not already initiated a commit or rollback (e.g., due to a timeout - see below).

5. **Timeout Handling:** If the `TransactionCoordinator` does not receive a response from a service during the `prepare()` phase within a configurable timeout period (e.g., 5 seconds), it should consider the service as having failed and proceed with the rollback phase.

6.  **Idempotency:** The `commit()` and `rollback()` methods on the `TransactionalService` *must* be idempotent.  The coordinator might call these methods multiple times in case of network issues or failures.

7.  **Concurrency:** The `TransactionCoordinator` must be thread-safe and handle concurrent transaction requests correctly.

8.  **Error Handling:**  The `TransactionCoordinator` should handle exceptions thrown by the `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods of the registered services gracefully. Log the errors but continue the transaction flow (either commit or rollback) for the remaining services.

**Constraints:**

*   You must use appropriate data structures for managing registered services and active transactions. Consider the performance implications of your choices.
*   The solution should be optimized for minimal latency and resource consumption, especially considering the potential for a large number of concurrent transactions.
*   Assume that network communication between the coordinator and the services can be unreliable.
*   While a full-fledged persistence mechanism is not required, consider how you would persist transaction state in a real-world scenario for recovery after a coordinator failure.  (Describe this in comments in your code)
*   Focus on correctness, efficiency, and maintainability of the code.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and data structures. It encourages the use of appropriate design patterns and careful consideration of error handling and edge cases. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be at LeetCode Hard level, focusing on algorithmic efficiency, advanced data structures, and real-world relevance.

**Problem: Distributed Transaction Manager**

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager for a system of microservices.  Imagine a scenario where multiple services need to update their local databases as part of a single, atomic transaction. If any part of the transaction fails, all changes across all services must be rolled back.

You are given a system with `N` microservices, each having its own independent database.  Each microservice exposes an API endpoint (`commit(transactionId)` and `rollback(transactionId)`) that can be used to either commit or rollback a specific transaction on that service.  These calls are idempotent, meaning calling them multiple times with the same `transactionId` has the same effect as calling them once. However, due to network instability, a service may be temporarily unavailable.

Your transaction manager must ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for all transactions.  Specifically, you need to implement a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

**Requirements:**

1.  **`TransactionManager` Class:** Implement a `TransactionManager` class with the following methods:

    *   `begin()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique `transactionId` (a long integer).
    *   `enlist(transactionId, serviceEndpoint)`: Enlists a microservice, identified by its `serviceEndpoint` (a String representing a URL, e.g., "http://service1:8080"), in the given `transactionId`.  The `serviceEndpoint` represents the address of the service's commit/rollback API.
    *   `commit(transactionId)`: Attempts to commit the transaction with the given `transactionId`.  This method must implement the 2PC protocol.  It should return `true` if the transaction successfully committed across all enlisted services, and `false` if any service failed to commit or was unavailable.
    *   `rollback(transactionId)`: Rolls back the transaction with the given `transactionId`. This must be called if `commit()` returns false. This method should return `true` if all enlisted services were successfully rolled back, and `false` if any service failed to rollback or was unavailable.

2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:** The `commit()` method must implement the 2PC protocol as follows:

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):**
        *   The transaction manager sends a "prepare" message (represented by calling a hypothetical `prepare(transactionId)` method on each enlisted service via HTTP) to all enlisted services.  Assume you have a helper method `boolean callService(serviceEndpoint, "prepare", transactionId)` which handles the HTTP call. The prepare call should return true if the service is ready to commit.
        *   Each service attempts to prepare the transaction. This might involve writing a log entry indicating the service is ready to commit.
        *   If *all* services successfully prepare, proceed to Phase 2. If *any* service fails to prepare or is unavailable, abort the transaction and call `rollback()` on all prepared services (if any).
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):**
        *   If all services prepared successfully, the transaction manager sends a "commit" message (represented by calling a hypothetical `commit(transactionId)` method on each enlisted service via HTTP) to all enlisted services. Assume you have a helper method `boolean callService(serviceEndpoint, "commit", transactionId)` which handles the HTTP call.
        *   If the commit command succeeds on all services, return `true`. If any service fails or is unavailable, call `rollback()` on all committed services (if any), and return `false`.
        *   If any service failed to prepare, the transaction manager sends a "rollback" message (represented by calling a hypothetical `rollback(transactionId)` method on each enlisted service via HTTP) to all enlisted services. Assume you have a helper method `boolean callService(serviceEndpoint, "rollback", transactionId)` which handles the HTTP call.
        *   If the rollback command succeeds on all services, return `true`. If any service fails or is unavailable, return `false`.

3.  **Error Handling & Idempotency:**

    *   Handle potential network failures (services being unavailable).  Implement retry logic with a limited number of retries (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff) for each `callService` operation. You can assume that `callService` throws an exception if it fails after the retries.
    *   Ensure idempotency of `commit()` and `rollback()` operations on the microservices.  Your transaction manager does not need to explicitly handle idempotency; assume the services themselves handle it.
    *   If a service is permanently unavailable after retries, log the error and continue processing other services.

4.  **Concurrency:**  The `TransactionManager` must be thread-safe.  Multiple threads may call `begin()`, `enlist()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` concurrently.

5. **Optimization:**
*   Enlistment should not be O(n) for every commit or rollback.
*   Avoid deadlocks when synchronizing access to transaction data structures.
*   Maximize concurrency during the 2PC protocol.  Consider parallelizing the prepare, commit, and rollback phases where possible.

**Constraints:**

*   `N` (number of microservices) can be up to 100.
*   The number of transactions can be up to 1000.
*   `serviceEndpoint` strings are valid URLs.
*   You are *not* allowed to modify the microservice API (e.g., adding a "prepare" endpoint).  You must simulate the "prepare" phase using the existing `commit()` and `rollback()` endpoints and other creative mechanisms.
*   Assume the `callService` method is already implemented and handles HTTP communication and retry logic. You only need to handle the overall transaction management logic.

**Helper Method (Provided):**

```java
boolean callService(String serviceEndpoint, String operation, long transactionId) throws Exception;
```

This method simulates calling the microservice API.  `serviceEndpoint` is the URL of the service, `operation` is either "prepare", "commit", or "rollback", and `transactionId` is the transaction ID.  The method returns `true` if the call was successful after retries, and throws an `Exception` if it failed after the maximum number of retries.  You must *implement* the retry logic within your `callService` function. The implementation of the retry logic should be done in a separate private function.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness (adherence to the 2PC protocol and ACID properties)
*   Concurrency (thread safety)
*   Error handling (handling network failures and service unavailability)
*   Efficiency (performance of commit and rollback operations, especially with a large number of services)
*   Code clarity and maintainability

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling.  It tests your ability to design and implement a complex algorithm with real-world constraints. Good luck!

## Question: Distributed Transactional Key-Value Store

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed, transactional key-value store. This store will consist of multiple nodes, and clients can interact with any node to perform read and write operations within ACID transactions. The system should handle concurrent transactions, node failures, and network partitions gracefully.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Data Model:** The store holds string keys and string values.

2.  **Transactions:** Clients must be able to initiate, commit, and rollback transactions. All operations within a transaction should be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).

3.  **Concurrency Control:** Implement a concurrency control mechanism (e.g., two-phase locking, optimistic concurrency control) to ensure transaction isolation and prevent data corruption. Pay careful attention to potential deadlocks and livelocks.

4.  **Distribution:** Data should be partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes. Design a partitioning scheme (e.g., consistent hashing) to distribute data evenly. Implement a replication strategy (e.g., primary-backup, multi-master) to ensure data availability and fault tolerance. The number of replicas is a configurable parameter.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should tolerate node failures and network partitions. When a node fails, the system should automatically recover and continue to serve client requests. When a network partition occurs, the system should attempt to maintain consistency and availability as much as possible (consider CAP theorem implications).

6.  **API:** Implement the following API:

    *   `begin_transaction()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a transaction ID.
    *   `read(transaction_id, key)`: Reads the value associated with a key within a transaction. If the key doesn't exist, return `null`.
    *   `write(transaction_id, key, value)`: Writes a value to a key within a transaction.
    *   `commit_transaction(transaction_id)`: Commits a transaction, making all changes permanent.
    *   `rollback_transaction(transaction_id)`: Rolls back a transaction, discarding all changes.

7.  **Optimization:**
    * Implement a mechanism to detect and resolve deadlocks.
    * Optimize read/write operations to minimize latency, considering that data may need to be fetched from multiple replicas.
    * Explore different concurrency control strategies and replication strategies, analyzing their trade-offs in terms of performance, consistency, and availability.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the cluster is configurable.
*   The replication factor is configurable.
*   Network latency between nodes can be significant and variable.
*   Nodes may fail at any time.
*   Transactions can be long-running.
*   The system should handle a large number of concurrent transactions.
*   Consider consistency levels: strong consistency vs eventual consistency. Implement mechanisms to provide tunable consistency.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The system must correctly implement ACID transactions.
*   **Performance:** The system must handle a large number of concurrent transactions with low latency.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must tolerate node failures and network partitions gracefully.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to scale to a large number of nodes and data.
*   **Code Quality:** The code must be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   **Design Rationale:** Provide a clear explanation of the design choices, including the concurrency control mechanism, the data partitioning scheme, the replication strategy, and the fault tolerance mechanisms. Justify the trade-offs made.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, fault tolerance, and data management. It is a challenging problem that requires careful design and implementation. Good luck!

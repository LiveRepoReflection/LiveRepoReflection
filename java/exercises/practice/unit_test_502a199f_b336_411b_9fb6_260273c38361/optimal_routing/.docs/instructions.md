Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Java coding problem. Here it is:

**Project Name:** `OptimalRoutePlanning`

**Question Description:**

A major logistics company, "GlobalTransit," needs to optimize its delivery routes across a large, interconnected city. The city can be represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent delivery locations (warehouses, customer addresses, etc.) and edges represent roads connecting these locations. Each road has an associated *travel time* (in minutes) and a *toll cost* (in USD).

GlobalTransit has a central depot (source node) and multiple delivery destinations.  Each delivery destination has a *delivery window* (start time, end time) represented in minutes from the start of the day (0 minutes to 1440 minutes).

The company wants to minimize the total cost associated with deliveries while ensuring all deliveries are made within their respective delivery windows. The total cost is a weighted sum of the total travel time and the total toll cost. The weight for travel time is `timeWeight` and the weight for toll cost is `tollWeight`.

Given:

*   `numLocations`: The number of locations in the city (nodes in the graph). Locations are numbered from `0` to `numLocations - 1`. Location `0` is the central depot.
*   `roads`: A list of directed edges represented as `List<int[]>`. Each `int[]` has the form `{source, destination, travelTime, tollCost}`.
*   `deliveryDestinations`: A list of delivery destination locations, represented as a `List<Integer>`.
*   `deliveryWindows`: A map where the key is the destination location (Integer) and the value is an array `int[]` of size 2,  `{startTime, endTime}` representing the delivery window for that location.  `startTime` and `endTime` are in minutes from the beginning of the day.
*   `timeWeight`: A double representing the weight applied to travel time in the cost function.
*   `tollWeight`: A double representing the weight applied to toll cost in the cost function.

Your task is to write a function `double findOptimalRouteCost(int numLocations, List<int[]> roads, List<Integer> deliveryDestinations, Map<Integer, int[]> deliveryWindows, double timeWeight, double tollWeight)` that returns the minimum total cost required to deliver to all specified destinations within their respective delivery windows, starting from the central depot (location 0).

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **All delivery destinations MUST be visited.** The order of visiting does not matter.
*   **Delivery Windows are Hard Constraints:** A delivery *must* occur within the specified `[startTime, endTime]` inclusive.  If a delivery cannot be made within its window, the solution is invalid, and the function should return `Double.MAX_VALUE`.
*   **Waiting is Allowed:** At any location (including the destination), the delivery vehicle can wait to meet the start of the delivery window, without incurring any cost.
*   **Cycles:** The graph may contain cycles.
*   **Disconnected Graph:** It is possible that some delivery locations are unreachable from the depot. In this case, return `Double.MAX_VALUE`.
*   **Optimization:** The algorithm should be optimized for performance. The graph can be large (up to 1000 locations and 5000 roads), and a naive solution will likely time out.
*   **Floating-Point Precision:** Be mindful of potential floating-point precision issues when calculating the total cost.

**Example:**

Let's say you have two delivery destinations with tight delivery windows. A direct path to each destination might be fast but expensive in tolls. An alternate, longer route might have lower tolls and still allow you to meet the delivery windows if you choose the order of destinations optimally. Your solution needs to intelligently explore these trade-offs.

Good luck! This problem requires careful algorithm design and efficient implementation to handle all the constraints and achieve optimal performance.

## Question: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduling algorithm for a complex system. You are given a set of `N` tasks, each with the following attributes:

*   `taskId` (Integer): A unique identifier for the task (1 to N).
*   `duration` (Integer): The time (in arbitrary units) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline` (Integer): The latest time (in the same units as duration) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies` (List of Integers): A list of `taskIds` that must be completed before this task can be started. A task cannot start until all its dependencies are finished.

Your goal is to determine a schedule (an ordered list of `taskIds`) that completes all tasks while minimizing the number of tasks that miss their deadlines. If multiple schedules exist with the same number of missed deadlines, you must choose the schedule that minimizes the total lateness. Lateness of a task is defined as `max(0, completionTime - deadline)`.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   `N` (Integer): The number of tasks.
*   A list of `N` task descriptions, where each task description is a tuple: `(duration, deadline, dependencies)`. `dependencies` is a list of integers representing the taskIds.

**Output:**

Your function should return:

*   A list of integers representing the optimal task schedule (the ordered list of `taskIds`).
*   If it is impossible to complete all tasks (due to circular dependencies, for example), return an empty list `[]`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 30`
*   `1 <= duration <= 100` for each task.
*   `1 <= deadline <= 1000` for each task.
*   Task IDs are integers from `1` to `N`.
*   The dependency list for each task will contain valid task IDs.
*   The input will not be malformed.

**Example:**

```
N = 3
tasks = [
    (3, 10, []),  // Task 1: duration 3, deadline 10, no dependencies
    (5, 15, [1]),  // Task 2: duration 5, deadline 15, depends on Task 1
    (2, 12, [1])   // Task 3: duration 2, deadline 12, depends on Task 1
]

Optimal Schedule: [1, 3, 2]

Explanation:
- Task 1 completes at time 3 (meets deadline).
- Task 3 completes at time 5 (3 + 2) (meets deadline).
- Task 2 completes at time 10 (5 + 5) (meets deadline).
No tasks missed their deadline.
Other possible schedules include [1, 2, 3] which also completes all tasks on time. This schedule would also be a valid solution.
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following:

1.  **Correctness:** Does your algorithm produce a valid schedule that respects dependencies?
2.  **Missed Deadlines Minimization:** Does your algorithm minimize the number of tasks that miss their deadlines?
3.  **Lateness Minimization:** Among schedules with the same number of missed deadlines, does your algorithm minimize the total lateness?
4.  **Efficiency:** Given the constraints, is your algorithm reasonably efficient? An inefficient solution that times out for larger test cases will not be accepted. Consider the trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches.

**Hints:**

*   Think about topological sorting for handling dependencies.
*   Consider using dynamic programming or branch and bound techniques to explore possible schedules.
*   Be mindful of edge cases, such as tasks with no dependencies and tasks with very tight deadlines.
*   Circular dependencies should be handled gracefully, returning an empty list.

This problem requires careful consideration of dependencies, deadlines, and schedule optimization. A brute-force approach may not be efficient enough to solve all test cases within the time limit. Good luck!

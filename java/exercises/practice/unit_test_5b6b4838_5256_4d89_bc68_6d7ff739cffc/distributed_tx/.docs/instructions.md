## Question: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture. The system manages transactions that span multiple independent services. Due to network unreliability and service failures, atomicity and consistency are paramount.

**Scenario:**

Imagine an e-commerce platform where a customer places an order. This order involves multiple microservices:

*   **Order Service:** Creates the order record.
*   **Inventory Service:** Reserves the items from inventory.
*   **Payment Service:** Processes the payment.

A transaction must ensure that either all three operations succeed, or none of them do. If any service fails during the process, the entire transaction must be rolled back.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Implement a simplified DTC that supports two-phase commit (2PC).** The DTC acts as the coordinator and the microservices act as participants.
2.  **The DTC must handle service failures and network partitions.** Implement a timeout mechanism. If a participant doesn't respond within a specified timeout, the transaction should be rolled back.
3.  **Implement a recovery mechanism.** In case the DTC itself fails, it should be able to recover its state and resume the transaction processing upon restart.
4.  **Implement idempotent operations in participant services.** Ensure that a participant service can handle duplicate prepare or commit/rollback requests without side effects.
5.  **Implement a logging mechanism.** Log all the critical steps of the transaction (prepare, commit, rollback, timeouts, failures) with appropriate timestamps and transaction IDs for debugging and auditing purposes.

**Constraints:**

*   Assume that each microservice exposes a simple API with `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods. These methods return boolean values indicating success or failure.
*   Assume a simplified communication mechanism (e.g., direct HTTP calls).
*   Optimize for **throughput** and **latency**. Minimizing the time taken for a transaction to complete is critical.
*   Minimize the **impact on the participant services**. The DTC should not introduce significant overhead to the normal operation of the participant services.
*   The solution should be designed for **scalability**. The DTC should be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions.

**Input:**

The input to your DTC is a list of service endpoints (URLs for the Order, Inventory, and Payment Services) and a unique transaction ID.

**Output:**

The DTC should return a boolean value indicating whether the transaction was successfully committed (true) or rolled back (false).

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   What happens if the DTC fails after sending the prepare message but before receiving responses from all participants?
*   What happens if the DTC fails after receiving all prepare responses but before sending the commit/rollback messages?
*   How do you handle situations where a participant service is permanently unavailable?
*   How do you prevent the DTC from becoming a bottleneck?
*   How can you ensure that the logging mechanism doesn't impact performance?
*   Consider the trade-offs between strong consistency and availability in a distributed system.
*   How do you make sure that the transaction ID is unique across the distributed system?
*   How to prevent the DTC from getting stuck in a state of waiting for responses from unreachable services forever?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems principles, transaction management, concurrency, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

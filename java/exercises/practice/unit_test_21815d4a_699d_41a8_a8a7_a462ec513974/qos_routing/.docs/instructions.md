## Question: Optimized Network Routing with QoS Constraints

### Project Description

Imagine you are designing the core routing algorithm for a new generation of Internet routers. Unlike traditional routers that primarily focus on minimizing the path length (hop count) or latency, these routers must also guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) for different types of network traffic.

Specifically, you need to implement a routing algorithm that finds the optimal path between two nodes in a network, subject to multiple constraints:

1.  **Bandwidth:** The path must have a minimum available bandwidth to support the traffic flow. Each link in the network has a maximum bandwidth capacity and a current bandwidth usage.

2.  **Latency:** The path's total latency must be below a certain threshold. Each link in the network has an associated latency.

3.  **Packet Loss Probability:** The end-to-end packet loss probability along the path must be below a certain threshold. Each link has a packet loss probability. The packet loss probability of a path is calculated as:
    `1 - ((1 - p1) * (1 - p2) * ... * (1 - pn))`, where `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` are the packet loss probabilities of the individual links in the path.

4.  **Cost:** Each link has an associated cost. Among all paths that satisfy the bandwidth, latency, and packet loss probability constraints, you must choose the path with the minimum total cost.

### Input

Your program will receive the following input:

*   `numNodes`: The number of nodes in the network (numbered from 0 to `numNodes - 1`).
*   `edges`: A list of edges in the network. Each edge is represented as a tuple `(source, destination, bandwidthCapacity, bandwidthUsage, latency, packetLossProbability, cost)`.
*   `sourceNode`: The starting node for the path.
*   `destinationNode`: The ending node for the path.
*   `requiredBandwidth`: The minimum bandwidth required for the traffic flow.
*   `maxLatency`: The maximum allowed latency for the path.
*   `maxPacketLossProbability`: The maximum allowed packet loss probability for the path.

### Output

Your program should return a list of node indices representing the optimal path from `sourceNode` to `destinationNode` that satisfies all the constraints and minimizes the total cost. If no such path exists, return an empty list.

### Constraints

*   `1 <= numNodes <= 1000`
*   `0 <= number of edges <= numNodes * (numNodes - 1)`
*   `0 <= source, destination < numNodes`
*   `bandwidthCapacity >= bandwidthUsage >= 0`
*   `latency >= 0`
*   `0 <= packetLossProbability <= 1`
*   `cost >= 0`
*   The network may contain cycles.
*   There may be multiple edges between two nodes.

### Optimization Requirements

*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large networks (up to 1000 nodes and a dense connection of edges between them) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize the search for the optimal path.

### Edge Cases

*   Handle cases where no path exists between the source and destination nodes.
*   Handle cases where the source and destination nodes are the same.
*   Handle cases where the required bandwidth is greater than the capacity of any single link.
*   Handle cases with very small packet loss probabilities (potential for underflow errors).
*   Handle cases with floating-point imprecision when calculating the path's packet loss probability.

### Example

```
numNodes = 4
edges = [
    (0, 1, 100, 20, 10, 0.01, 5),
    (0, 2, 80, 30, 15, 0.02, 8),
    (1, 2, 70, 10, 5, 0.005, 3),
    (1, 3, 90, 0, 20, 0.015, 10),
    (2, 3, 60, 5, 12, 0.01, 6)
]
sourceNode = 0
destinationNode = 3
requiredBandwidth = 50
maxLatency = 40
maxPacketLossProbability = 0.03

Output: [0, 1, 3]
```

**Explanation:**

*   Path 0 -> 1 -> 3 satisfies the bandwidth (100 - 20 >= 50, 90 - 0 >= 50), latency (10 + 20 <= 40), and packet loss probability constraints (1 - (1 - 0.01) * (1 - 0.015) = 0.02485 <= 0.03) and has a total cost of 5 + 10 = 15.
*   Path 0 -> 2 -> 3 satisfies the bandwidth (80 - 30 >= 50, 60 - 5 >= 50), latency (15 + 12 <= 40), and packet loss probability constraints (1 - (1 - 0.02) * (1 - 0.01) = 0.0298 <= 0.03) and has a total cost of 8 + 6 = 14.
*   Therefore, path 0 -> 2 -> 3 is the optimal path.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal algorithms (like Dijkstra's or A\*), constraint satisfaction, and careful handling of floating-point calculations. The optimization requirement adds another layer of complexity, pushing candidates to think about efficient data structures and algorithm selection. Good luck!

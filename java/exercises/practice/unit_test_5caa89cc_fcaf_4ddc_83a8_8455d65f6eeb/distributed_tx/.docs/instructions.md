Okay, here is a challenging Java coding problem.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Manager**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a system involving multiple independent services. This DTM will be responsible for coordinating transactions that span across these services, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).

Imagine a scenario where you have several microservices, each responsible for managing a specific resource (e.g., User Service, Product Service, Order Service). A single business operation might require updates across multiple services. For example, placing an order might involve reserving inventory in the Product Service, creating an order record in the Order Service, and debiting the user's account in the User Service.

Your DTM will act as a central coordinator to ensure that either *all* of these operations succeed (commit) or *none* of them do (rollback).

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Definition:** Define a `Transaction` object that includes a unique transaction ID and a list of `Participant` objects.

2.  **Participant Interface:** Define a `Participant` interface with two methods: `prepare()` and `commit()`/`rollback()`.  `prepare()` should attempt to tentatively perform the operation and return `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.  `commit()` should permanently apply the changes, and `rollback()` should undo any tentative changes made during `prepare()`.  Participants should be able to handle prepare, commit, and rollback requests concurrently.

3.  **DTM Core Logic:** Implement the core DTM logic, which should include the following steps:

    *   **Start Transaction:** Assign a unique ID to a new transaction.
    *   **Register Participants:** Allow services to register participants with the DTM for a given transaction.
    *   **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:**
        *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):**  The DTM sends a `prepare()` request to all registered participants. If *any* participant fails to prepare, the transaction must be rolled back.
        *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):** If all participants successfully prepare, the DTM sends a `commit()` request to all participants. Otherwise, the DTM sends a `rollback()` request to all participants.
    *   **Transaction Completion:**  Once all participants have either committed or rolled back, the DTM should mark the transaction as complete.

4.  **Concurrency:** The DTM must be thread-safe and handle concurrent transaction requests gracefully.  Consider using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

5.  **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for the `prepare()` phase. If a participant does not respond within a reasonable timeframe, the DTM should consider the participant to have failed and initiate a rollback.

6.  **Idempotency:**  Participants should be designed to handle `commit()` and `rollback()` requests multiple times without causing unintended side effects (i.e., they should be idempotent).

7.  **Logging:** Implement basic logging to record transaction events (start, prepare, commit, rollback, completion).

**Constraints:**

*   **In-Memory:** The entire DTM and all transaction data must be stored in memory.
*   **No External Libraries:** You are restricted to using standard Java libraries.
*   **Scalability (Conceptual):** While the implementation is in-memory, consider how the design could be extended to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and participants.  Explain your thought process in comments.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   **Resource Management:** Implement appropriate resource management (e.g., releasing locks) after transaction completion.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Minimize Latency:**  Optimize the DTM's performance to minimize the latency of transaction commit/rollback operations.  Consider using concurrency effectively and avoiding unnecessary blocking operations.
*   **Minimize Resource Consumption:** Reduce the memory footprint and CPU usage of the DTM.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine three services: `UserService`, `ProductService`, and `OrderService`.  A "Place Order" transaction requires updates to all three services.  Your DTM should coordinate this transaction, ensuring that either the user's account is debited, the product inventory is reserved, and the order is created *or* none of these actions happen.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the DTM correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure ACID properties?
*   Concurrency: Does the DTM handle concurrent transactions correctly and efficiently?
*   Performance: How well does the DTM perform in terms of latency and resource consumption?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Error Handling: Does the DTM handle errors gracefully and provide informative logging?
*   Design: Is the design scalable and extensible?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and transaction management. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to design a challenging Java coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) for a microservice architecture. Imagine a scenario where multiple services need to participate in a single, atomic transaction. If any service fails to complete its part of the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

Your DTC will manage transactions across a cluster of services. Each service can perform operations that modify its local data. To ensure atomicity, the DTC must implement a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Management:** Implement methods to start a new transaction, commit a transaction, and rollback a transaction. Each transaction should have a unique transaction ID.

2.  **Service Registration:** Services can dynamically register with the DTC, providing their endpoint (e.g., URL or address).

3.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** Implement the 2PC protocol:
    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):** When a client requests to commit a transaction, the DTC sends a "prepare" message to all participating services. Each service must attempt to perform its operation and respond with either "prepared" (if successful and the operation is ready to be committed) or "aborted" (if the operation failed). The service must persist the prepared state, such as saving the changes in temporary tables or using write-ahead logging, ensuring the changes can be committed or rolled back. If any service responds with "aborted," the DTC must abort the entire transaction.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):** If all services respond with "prepared," the DTC sends a "commit" message to all services. If any service responded with "aborted" in Phase 1, the DTC sends a "rollback" message to all services.  Services must then either permanently commit their changes or roll back to their previous state, respectively. They must respond to the DTC with "committed" or "rolledback" upon completion.

4.  **Concurrency:** The DTC must handle concurrent transaction requests efficiently. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.

5.  **Failure Handling:** The DTC must be resilient to service failures. If a service fails to respond during either phase, the DTC should retry a certain number of times. If the service remains unresponsive, the DTC should abort the transaction (or consider a failover strategy if you want to add more complexity).

6.  **Transaction Log:** Maintain a transaction log to record the status of each transaction (started, prepared, committed, rolled back). This log should be persistent (e.g., written to disk) to allow the DTC to recover its state in case of a crash.

7.  **Scalability:** Consider the scalability of your design. While a fully distributed implementation is not required for this problem, think about how your design could be extended to handle a large number of services and transactions.

8.  **Optimization:** Strive for efficient resource utilization. Avoid unnecessary network calls and minimize the time spent in each phase of the 2PC protocol.

**Input/Output:**

*   **Input:** Requests to start, commit, and rollback transactions. Service registration requests.
*   **Output:** Responses indicating the success or failure of each operation. Log entries.

**Constraints:**

*   Assume a maximum number of participating services per transaction.
*   Assume a maximum transaction duration (before a timeout occurs).
*   Network communication is assumed to be unreliable (messages can be lost or delayed).

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the DTC correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity?
*   Concurrency: Does the DTC handle concurrent transactions safely and efficiently?
*   Failure Handling: Does the DTC handle service failures gracefully?
*   Performance: Is the DTC efficient in terms of resource utilization and transaction completion time?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Scalability Considerations: Does the design show awareness of scalability challenges?

**Bonus Challenges (Optional):**

*   Implement a more sophisticated failure recovery mechanism (e.g., using a backup DTC).
*   Implement a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Paxos or Raft) to ensure the reliability of the transaction log.
*   Provide a mechanism for services to "vote" on whether to commit or abort a transaction based on business logic.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and transaction management. It's designed to be challenging and open-ended, allowing for multiple valid approaches with different trade-offs. Good luck!

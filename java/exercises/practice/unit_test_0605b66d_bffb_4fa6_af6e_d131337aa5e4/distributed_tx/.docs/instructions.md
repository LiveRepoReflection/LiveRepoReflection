Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be LeetCode Hard level.

**Project Name:** `DistributedTransactionManager`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager for a system involving multiple independent services.  These services, each managing their own data, need to participate in atomic transactions.  The goal is to ensure that either all participating services commit their changes, or all rollback, maintaining data consistency across the system.

Your transaction manager will orchestrate two-phase commit (2PC) protocol among the involved services.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Service Abstraction:**  Assume you have an interface `Service` with the following methods:

    *   `boolean prepare(TransactionContext transactionContext)`:  Each service receives a `prepare` call with a `TransactionContext`. The service should attempt to prepare for the transaction (e.g., reserve resources, validate data). It should return `true` if preparation is successful, and `false` otherwise. The preparation should be idempotent, meaning that multiple calls to prepare with the same `TransactionContext` should have the same side-effects as a single call.
    *   `void commit(TransactionContext transactionContext)`:  If all services prepare successfully, each receives a `commit` call. The service should durably persist the transaction's changes. The commit should be idempotent.
    *   `void rollback(TransactionContext transactionContext)`: If any service fails to prepare, all participating services receive a `rollback` call. The service should revert any changes made during the prepare phase. The rollback should be idempotent.

2.  **TransactionContext:** Implement a `TransactionContext` class that includes a unique transaction ID (UUID).  This ID is used to correlate operations across services.

3.  **Transaction Manager:**  Implement a class `TransactionManager` with the following method:

    *   `boolean executeTransaction(List<Service> services)`:  This method takes a list of `Service` instances. The `TransactionManager` should:

        *   Generate a new `TransactionContext`.
        *   Invoke `prepare` on each service in the provided list *concurrently*.
        *   If *all* services return `true` from `prepare`, invoke `commit` on each service *concurrently*.  Return `true` to indicate successful transaction completion.
        *   If *any* service returns `false` from `prepare`, or if an exception occurs during the prepare phase, invoke `rollback` on each service *concurrently*. Return `false` to indicate transaction failure.
        *   Ensure proper cleanup of resources (e.g., threads).

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Concurrency:** The `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` calls on services must be executed concurrently to minimize transaction latency. Use appropriate concurrency mechanisms (e.g., ExecutorService, Futures, locks) to manage threads safely.
*   **Idempotency:**  The `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods *must* be idempotent. Services may receive these calls multiple times (due to network issues, retries, etc.). Your design must handle this gracefully.
*   **Timeouts:** Introduce a timeout for the `prepare` phase. If a service takes longer than a specified time (e.g., 5 seconds) to prepare, consider it a failure and initiate rollback on the other services.
*   **Exception Handling:**  Services may throw exceptions during `prepare`, `commit`, or `rollback`. Handle these exceptions gracefully, ensuring that all other services are rolled back (if necessary) and that no resources are leaked.  Log exceptions appropriately.
*   **Deadlock Avoidance:** Be mindful of potential deadlocks, especially if services acquire locks internally during preparation.  Consider techniques like lock ordering or timeouts to prevent deadlocks.
*   **Resource Management:** Design your solution to efficiently manage threads and other resources. Avoid creating excessive threads or leaking resources.
*   **Logging:** Implement basic logging (using a logger like `java.util.logging`) to track transaction progress, service responses, and any errors that occur.
*   **Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Locking:** Consider the trade-offs between optimistic and pessimistic locking strategies within the services' prepare methods.  Document your choice and justification.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize transaction latency by maximizing concurrency.
*   Efficiently manage resources (threads, memory).
*   The solution should be robust and resilient to failures.

**Real-World Considerations:**

This problem simulates a common scenario in distributed systems where data consistency is critical across multiple services.  Consider how your solution would scale to a large number of services and high transaction volume.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

There are several ways to implement the concurrency and exception handling in this problem.  The "best" solution will depend on factors such as code readability, maintainability, and performance.  Consider the trade-offs between different approaches.

This problem tests not only coding skills but also system design thinking, concurrency management, and error handling best practices. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging problem description for a high-level Java programming competition question, aiming for LeetCode Hard difficulty:

## Question: Distributed Transaction Manager

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, distributed transaction manager for a microservice architecture. Imagine a system where multiple independent services need to participate in a single, atomic transaction. A classic example is an e-commerce system where placing an order involves updating inventory, charging the customer, and creating a shipping record, all of which are handled by different services.

Your goal is to build a system that ensures either *all* of these operations succeed, or *none* of them do, even in the face of network failures, service crashes, or other unexpected errors.

**Specifically, you need to implement a "Two-Phase Commit" (2PC) protocol coordinator.**

**Services:**

Assume you have access to a set of independent services. Each service exposes a simple interface:

*   **`prepare(transactionId)`**: This method attempts to "prepare" the service for the transaction. It performs necessary checks (e.g., sufficient inventory, valid credit card) and reserves resources. If successful, it returns `true`. If it fails (e.g., insufficient inventory), it returns `false`. It is assumed that the service will remain in a prepared state until told to commit or rollback. The implementation must be idempotent, meaning that calling `prepare()` multiple times with the same `transactionId` will not alter the outcome.
*   **`commit(transactionId)`**: This method permanently applies the changes associated with the transaction. It should only be called if `prepare()` returned `true`. It is assumed that calling `commit()` is eventually successful, perhaps via retries (i.e. it is guaranteed to succeed). The implementation must be idempotent.
*   **`rollback(transactionId)`**: This method undoes any changes made during the `prepare()` phase. It should be called if `prepare()` failed for any service or if the coordinator decides to abort the transaction. It is assumed that calling `rollback()` is eventually successful, perhaps via retries (i.e. it is guaranteed to succeed). The implementation must be idempotent.

**Transaction Manager:**

Your task is to implement a `TransactionManager` class with the following methods:

*   **`beginTransaction()`**: Starts a new transaction and returns a unique `transactionId` (String).
*   **`enlistService(transactionId, service)`**: Adds a service to the transaction. The `service` argument is a reference to the interface described above.
*   **`commitTransaction(transactionId)`**: Attempts to commit the transaction. This method must implement the 2PC protocol:
    1.  Send a `prepare()` message to all enlisted services.
    2.  If all services successfully prepare (return `true`), send a `commit()` message to all services.
    3.  If any service fails to prepare (returns `false`), or if the coordinator times out waiting for a response, send a `rollback()` message to all services.
    4.  After sending `commit()` or `rollback()`, the transaction is considered finished and resources can be freed.
    5.  Return `true` if the transaction was successfully committed, `false` otherwise.
*   **`rollbackTransaction(transactionId)`**: Rolls back the transaction. This method should be called if you want to explicitly roll back the transaction before calling commitTransaction(). Note that you might need to roll back a transaction that has already been rolled back by another thread (idempotency!).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The `TransactionManager` must be thread-safe. Multiple transactions can be running concurrently.
*   **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for the `prepare()` phase. If a service does not respond within a specified time (e.g., 5 seconds), assume it has failed.
*   **Idempotency:** As mentioned above, the `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods on the services are assumed to be idempotent.  Your transaction manager *must* handle cases where a service might receive duplicate `commit()` or `rollback()` requests due to network issues or coordinator restarts.
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Services should be called asynchronously to maximize performance. Use Java's concurrency utilities (e.g., `ExecutorService`, `Future`) effectively.
*   **Logging:** Implement logging to track the progress of transactions (e.g., when a transaction starts, when a service is prepared, when a commit or rollback is initiated).  This is crucial for debugging and auditing.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to deal with service failures, network issues, and timeouts. Use appropriate exception handling and logging to ensure that failures are detected and handled gracefully.
*   **Optimizations:** Consider optimizations such as batching prepare requests, or implementing a more sophisticated consensus algorithm for the decision to commit or rollback (although a basic 2PC implementation is sufficient). This part is optional but can be taken into account during judging.
*   **Scalability:** While not strictly enforced in testing, consider the scalability of your design. How would your `TransactionManager` handle a large number of concurrent transactions and a large number of participating services?
*   **Testing:** You are expected to implement comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of your `TransactionManager`. Pay attention to edge cases, concurrency issues, and failure scenarios.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```java
TransactionManager tm = new TransactionManager();
String txId = tm.beginTransaction();
tm.enlistService(txId, inventoryService);
tm.enlistService(txId, paymentService);
tm.enlistService(txId, shippingService);

boolean committed = tm.commitTransaction(txId);

if (committed) {
  System.out.println("Transaction " + txId + " committed successfully.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Transaction " + txId + " failed.");
}
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness (passes all test cases)
*   Thread-safety
*   Robustness (handles failures gracefully)
*   Efficiency (performance and resource usage)
*   Code quality (readability, maintainability, design)
*   Completeness of unit tests
*   Scalability Considerations

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. It also demands careful attention to detail and the ability to write robust and well-tested code. Good luck!

## Question: Optimal Route Finder with Real-Time Traffic

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient route-finding service that operates in a dynamic environment with real-time traffic updates. The service must find the optimal route between two given locations on a road network, minimizing the estimated travel time.

The road network is represented as a directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent locations (intersections, landmarks). Each node has a unique ID (integer).
*   Edges represent road segments connecting two locations. Each edge has:
    *   A source node ID.
    *   A destination node ID.
    *   A base travel time (in seconds) under ideal (free-flow) conditions.
    *   A congestion factor representing the current traffic condition. This factor is a floating-point number greater than or equal to 1.0. A factor of 1.0 indicates no congestion (free-flow). A factor of 2.0 indicates that the travel time on that segment is doubled due to traffic.

The estimated travel time for a road segment is calculated as `base travel time * congestion factor`.

Your service should:

1.  **Ingest Road Network Data:** Efficiently load and store the road network graph from a data source (e.g., a file or database). The format will be provided during testing, but the implementation should be adaptable to different formats. The data source will be significantly large.

2.  **Real-Time Traffic Updates:** Handle a stream of real-time traffic updates. Each update specifies a road segment (source node ID, destination node ID) and its new congestion factor.  The update frequency could be very high.

3.  **Optimal Route Query:** Given a start location (node ID) and a destination location (node ID), find the route with the minimum estimated travel time. You should return an ordered list of node IDs representing the route, and the total estimated travel time.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Large Graph:** The road network can be very large (millions of nodes and edges). Memory usage must be carefully considered.
*   **Fast Queries:** Route queries must be executed quickly, even with frequent traffic updates. Pre-computation techniques are encouraged, but must be balanced against memory usage and update overhead.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** Traffic updates must be processed efficiently without significantly impacting query performance.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle disconnected graphs (no route exists), invalid node IDs, and other potential data inconsistencies gracefully.
*   **Heuristic Function:** Incorporate a heuristic function to potentially speed up the search (e.g., A\* search). The heuristic should be admissible (never overestimate the distance to the destination). A simple Euclidean distance calculation based on node coordinates will be provided as an option, but you are free to develop your own. If the graph is disconnected, the algorithm should still try to find the shortest path in the connected components.
*   **Algorithm Efficiency:** The underlying graph search algorithm must be efficient (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, A\* search).
*   **Multiple Valid Routes:** If multiple routes have the same minimum travel time, return any one of them.
*   **Avoid Negative Cycles**: The road network should not contain any negative cycles.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The route returned must be a valid path between the start and destination, and the calculated travel time must be accurate.
*   **Performance:** The route query time and the traffic update processing time will be measured. Solutions will be ranked based on their performance.
*   **Memory Usage:** Excessive memory usage will be penalized.
*   **Code Quality:** Code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem emphasizes the design and implementation of an efficient and scalable route-finding service in a dynamic environment. It requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

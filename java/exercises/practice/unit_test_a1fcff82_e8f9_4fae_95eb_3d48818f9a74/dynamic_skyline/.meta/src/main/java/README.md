# Dynamic Skyline Solution

This solution uses a combination of data structures to efficiently handle the skyline operations:

1. A TreeMap to track critical points in the skyline, where keys are x-coordinates (sorted naturally)
2. At each x-coordinate, another TreeMap maps heights to their counts
3. A HashMap to track buildings for easy removal

## Time Complexity

- `addBuilding`: O(log n) where n is the number of buildings
- `removeBuilding`: O(log n)
- `getSkyline`: O(n log n) in the worst case

## Space Complexity

- O(n) where n is the number of buildings

## Implementation Details

The key insight is to represent the skyline as a series of "critical points" where the height changes. Each building contributes two critical points: one at its left edge (where height increases) and one at its right edge (where height potentially decreases).

For each critical point, we maintain a map of heights to their counts. This allows us to efficiently determine the maximum height at any given x-coordinate, and also to handle multiple buildings with the same dimensions.

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to test a variety of skills, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkReconfiguration`

**Question Description:**

A large data center is structured as a network of interconnected servers. Each server represents a node, and the network connections between servers represent undirected edges.  Due to evolving workload demands, the network needs to be reconfigured to optimize data flow.

Initially, the network is considered stable, but not necessarily optimal.  You are given the initial network configuration as an adjacency list (or matrix - the choice is up to the solver and should be justified in their comments) represented as `List<List<Integer>> network`.  `network.get(i)` contains a list of server IDs directly connected to server `i`. Server IDs are integers from `0` to `N-1`, where `N` is the total number of servers.

The goal is to minimize the **maximum latency** experienced by any data packet traversing the network. Latency between two directly connected servers is assumed to be 1.  Latency between two non-directly connected servers is the minimum number of hops required to reach the destination (shortest path). The maximum latency is the longest of all shortest paths between all pairs of servers in the network.

To achieve this optimization, you are allowed to perform a limited number of edge swaps. An edge swap involves removing one existing edge and creating a new edge between two servers that were *not* previously directly connected. You are given a maximum number of edge swaps allowed, `K`.

Write a function `int optimizeNetwork(List<List<Integer>> network, int K)` that returns the *minimum possible maximum latency* achievable after performing at most `K` edge swaps.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Networks:** The number of servers, `N`, can be up to 100.  The number of initial edges can be large, potentially creating a dense graph.
*   **Limited Swaps:**  The number of allowed swaps, `K`, is relatively small (typically between 1 and 5).
*   **Connected Graph:** The initial network is guaranteed to be connected.
*   **Optimization Goal:** The primary goal is to minimize the *maximum* latency, not the average latency.  This requires careful consideration of worst-case scenarios.
*   **Efficiency:**  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.  The solution must be efficient. Consider the time complexity of your chosen algorithms.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Consider edge cases such as:
    *   `K = 0` (no swaps allowed)
    *   `K` is larger than the number of possible new edges.
    *   The initial network is already optimal (or close to optimal).
*   **Real-world plausibility:**  Consider what kinds of network topologies would be realistic in a data center, and if there are any implicit constraints that would make certain solutions more/less practical.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The solution must produce the correct minimum maximum latency for all valid inputs.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution must execute within a reasonable time limit, even for large networks.
*   **Code Clarity and Readability:** The code should be well-structured, commented, and easy to understand.
*   **Algorithm Design:** The choice of algorithms and data structures should be appropriate for the problem and justified in comments.
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** The solution must correctly handle all edge cases.

This problem encourages the use of graph algorithms (shortest path algorithms like Floyd-Warshall or Dijkstra), efficient search strategies (potentially involving heuristics or pruning), and careful consideration of edge cases and time complexity. It's designed to be a challenging but rewarding problem for experienced programmers. Good luck!

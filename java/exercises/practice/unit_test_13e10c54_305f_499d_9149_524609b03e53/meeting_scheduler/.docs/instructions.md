## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient meeting scheduler for a large enterprise. The enterprise has a complex organizational structure with various departments, teams, and individual employees. Each employee has a personal calendar managed externally and accessible through an API.

Given a set of employees, a desired meeting duration, and a scheduling horizon (a time range within which the meeting should be scheduled), your goal is to find the *optimal* meeting time that minimizes disruption to existing schedules while adhering to several constraints.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Employee Availability:** You have access to an API that provides the busy slots (time ranges when an employee is unavailable) for each employee within the scheduling horizon.
2.  **Minimum Attendance:** The meeting must be scheduled only if at least a specified minimum number of employees can attend the meeting within the chosen time slot.
3.  **Room Capacity:** Each meeting room has a limited capacity. If the number of attendees exceeds the capacity of any available room, the meeting cannot be scheduled. The system should select the smallest room that fits all attendees.
4.  **Meeting Cost:** Each employee has an associated "meeting cost" representing their importance or impact. Scheduling a meeting during a busy slot for an employee incurs a penalty equal to their meeting cost.
5.  **Fairness:** Minimize the variance in the number of busy slots across all attendees after the meeting is scheduled. This ensures that no employee is disproportionately impacted.
6.  **Preference for Regular Work Hours:** The scheduler should prefer scheduling meetings during regular work hours (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM), all other factors being equal.

**Input:**

*   `employees`: A list of employee IDs (integers).
*   `duration`: The duration of the meeting in minutes (integer).
*   `schedulingHorizonStart`: The start time of the scheduling horizon (timestamp or datetime object).
*   `schedulingHorizonEnd`: The end time of the scheduling horizon (timestamp or datetime object).
*   `minimumAttendance`: The minimum number of employees required to attend the meeting (integer).
*   `rooms`: A list of meeting rooms, each represented by its capacity (integer).
*   `employeeData`: A Map containing data for each employee. The keys are employee IDs, and the values are maps containing the following:
    *   `meetingCost`: The meeting cost of the employee (integer).
    *   `busySlots`: A list of time ranges (start time, end time) representing the employee's busy slots within the scheduling horizon.

**Output:**

*   The optimal meeting start time (timestamp or datetime object).
*   If no suitable meeting time can be found, return `null`.
*   The system should return the meeting room chosen for the meeting.

**Optimization Goal:**

Minimize the following cost function:

`TotalCost = (Sum of meeting costs for employees with busy slots) + (Fairness Variance) + (Penalty for scheduling outside regular hours)`

**Fairness Variance:** The variance of the number of busy slots each employee has after scheduling.
**Penalty for scheduling outside regular hours**: Large if outside work hours, 0 if inside.

**Constraints on Performance**
*   The API is rate limited. You can only make a limited number of API calls to retrieve the busy slots for employees within a given time period.
*   The Scheduler must find the "optimal" meeting time within a limited time frame and not exceed the API rate limit.

**Considerations:**

*   How do you efficiently represent and query time ranges?
*   How do you handle overlapping busy slots?
*   How do you efficiently calculate the cost function and find the optimal meeting time?
*   How do you handle the API rate limit? Consider caching or batching requests.
*   How do you approach this problem with scalability in mind (i.e. if the number of employees becomes very large)?

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, optimization techniques, and system design considerations. Good luck!

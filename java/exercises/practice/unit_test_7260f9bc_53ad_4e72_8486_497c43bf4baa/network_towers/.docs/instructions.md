Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to test advanced algorithmic knowledge and problem-solving skills, aiming for LeetCode Hard difficulty:

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkDeployment`

## Question Description

A telecommunications company is planning to deploy a 5G network in a region represented as a weighted, undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents a city, and each edge represents a potential connection between two cities with a specific cost (e.g., laying fiber optic cables).

The company has a limited budget (`B`) and needs to select a subset of cities to deploy 5G towers in.  The goal is to maximize the *coverage* of the network while staying within the budget.

Coverage is defined as follows:

*   **Direct Coverage:**  A city with a 5G tower directly covers itself.
*   **Indirect Coverage:** A city without a 5G tower is indirectly covered if it is within a certain distance (`D`) of *at least* `K` cities that *do* have 5G towers.  The distance between two cities is the shortest path distance between them in the graph (sum of edge weights along the path).

**Your Task:**

Write a Java program that takes as input:

1.  `N`: The number of cities (nodes) in the region. Cities are numbered from 0 to N-1.
2.  `edges`: A list of edges in the form `List<int[]> edges`, where each `int[]` represents an edge: `[city1, city2, cost]`.  `city1` and `city2` are the city indices, and `cost` is the cost of the connection between them.
3.  `B`: The total budget available for deploying 5G towers.
4.  `D`: The maximum distance for indirect coverage.
5.  `K`: The minimum number of neighboring cities with towers required for indirect coverage.
6.  `tower_cost`: The cost of building a 5G tower in a single city.

Your program should return a `Set<Integer>` representing the *optimal* set of cities (city indices) to deploy 5G towers in, such that the total cost of deploying the towers is within the budget `B`, and the total coverage (number of directly and indirectly covered cities) is maximized.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Graph Representation:** The graph can be dense or sparse. Choose an appropriate data structure to represent the graph efficiently.
*   **Shortest Paths:** Efficiently calculate the shortest path distances between all pairs of cities. Consider using algorithms like Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall.
*   **Optimization:** Finding the absolute optimal solution might be computationally expensive for larger graphs.  Focus on developing a reasonably efficient and effective heuristic or approximation algorithm.  Consider approaches like:
    *   Greedy algorithms (e.g., start with a small set of towers and iteratively add/remove towers based on coverage gain per cost).
    *   Local search algorithms (e.g., start with a random tower placement, then iteratively explore neighboring solutions by adding/removing/swapping towers).
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases such as:
    *   Empty graph (no cities).
    *   No possible solutions within the budget.
    *   Disconnected graph.
*   **Time Complexity:** Aim for the best possible time complexity given the constraints. Solutions with exponential time complexity are unlikely to pass.  Consider the trade-offs between solution quality and runtime.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially for large graphs.
*   **Multiple optimal solutions:** If multiple sets of cities result in the same maximum coverage, return any one of them.

**Example:**

```java
N = 5;
edges = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 4], [1, 2, 2], [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 1], [3, 4, 3]];
B = 10;
D = 4;
K = 2;
tower_cost = 3;

// Possible solution: {0, 4}
// Cost: 3 + 3 = 6 <= 10
// Coverage:
//   - Direct: 0, 4
//   - Indirect: 2 (within distance 4 of 0 and 4, K=2)
//   - Total: 3

// Another possible solution: {1, 2}
// Cost: 3 + 3 = 6 <= 10
// Coverage:
//   - Direct: 1, 2
//   - Indirect: 0 (within distance 4 of 1 and 2, K=2), 4 (within distance 4 of 1 and 2, K=2), 3 (within distance 5 of 1 and 2, K=2, so doesn't get covered)
//   - Total: 4 (This is a better solution)

//The function should return {1, 2}
```

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, graph algorithms, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

Okay, here is a challenging and sophisticated Java coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode's "Hard" difficulty.

**Problem Title: Distributed Task Scheduling with Resource Constraints**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a distributed system for executing a set of independent tasks. Each task requires a specific amount of CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. The system consists of `n` worker nodes, each with its own CPU, memory, and network bandwidth capacity.  A task can only be executed on a worker node if the node has sufficient resources to satisfy the task's requirements.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that optimally schedules these tasks across the worker nodes to minimize the overall completion time (makespan) of all tasks, subject to resource constraints and task dependencies.

**Input:**

*   `tasks`: A list of tasks. Each task is represented by a class/struct with the following attributes:
    *   `taskId`: A unique integer identifier for the task.
    *   `cpuRequired`: Integer representing CPU units required.
    *   `memoryRequired`: Integer representing memory units required.
    *   `networkBandwidthRequired`: Integer representing network bandwidth units required.
    *   `dependencies`: A list of `taskIds` that must be completed before this task can start.
    *   `estimatedExecutionTime`: Integer representing the estimated execution time of the task.

*   `workers`: A list of worker nodes. Each worker node is represented by a class/struct with the following attributes:
    *   `workerId`: A unique integer identifier for the worker node.
    *   `cpuCapacity`: Integer representing the total CPU units available.
    *   `memoryCapacity`: Integer representing the total memory units available.
    *   `networkBandwidthCapacity`: Integer representing the total network bandwidth units available.

**Output:**

A schedule representing the optimal assignment of tasks to worker nodes. The schedule should be a `Map<Integer, List<Task>>` where the key is the `workerId` and the value is a list of `Task` objects assigned to that worker, in the order they should be executed. If no feasible schedule exists that can complete all tasks, return an empty map.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

1.  **Resource Constraints:** Tasks can only be assigned to workers that have sufficient CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. A worker's resources are consumed while a task is executing on it.

2.  **Task Dependencies:** A task can only start executing after all its dependencies have been completed.

3.  **Optimization Goal (Makespan Minimization):** The primary goal is to minimize the makespan, which is the time when the last task finishes executing across all worker nodes.

4.  **Multiple Valid Solutions:** There may be multiple valid schedules that achieve the minimum makespan. Your algorithm should return one such optimal schedule.

5.  **Scalability:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle a large number of tasks (up to 1000) and worker nodes (up to 100).

6.  **Real-World Considerations:** Assume tasks can start as soon as their dependencies are met and a worker node has the required resources. Preemption is not allowed (once a task starts on a worker, it must complete).

7.  **Tie-Breaking:** When multiple tasks are ready to be scheduled, prioritize tasks with the longest estimated execution time (Longest Processing Time First). If execution times are equal, prioritize tasks with the most dependencies.

8.  **Feasibility:** If it is impossible to schedule all tasks given the resource constraints and dependencies, return an empty schedule.

**Example:**

```java
// Example Input (Simplified)
List<Task> tasks = List.of(
    new Task(1, 2, 4, 1, List.of(), 10),
    new Task(2, 1, 2, 2, List.of(1), 5),
    new Task(3, 3, 1, 1, List.of(2), 8)
);

List<Worker> workers = List.of(
    new Worker(1, 4, 8, 4),
    new Worker(2, 2, 4, 2)
);

// Expected Output (One possible optimal schedule)
Map<Integer, List<Task>> schedule = Map.of(
    1, List.of(tasks.get(0), tasks.get(2)), // Worker 1: Task 1 -> Task 3
    2, List.of(tasks.get(1))                // Worker 2: Task 2
);
```

**Hints and Potential Approaches:**

*   **Graph Representation:** Model the task dependencies as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
*   **Topological Sort:** Use topological sorting to determine the order in which tasks can be scheduled.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Explore heuristics for assigning tasks to workers, considering resource constraints and makespan minimization.  Consider variations of greedy algorithms, or more advanced techniques like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms (though the latter might be overkill).
*   **Backtracking:** In some cases, backtracking might be necessary to explore different scheduling options.
*   **Dynamic Programming:**  While not immediately obvious, explore if dynamic programming can be applied to optimize some aspect of the scheduling, possibly by pre-calculating optimal schedules for subsets of tasks.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

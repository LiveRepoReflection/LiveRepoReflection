## Project Name

**Distributed Rate Limiter with Adaptive Throttling**

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter system in Java. This system needs to protect a set of backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. The rate limiter should be:

*   **Distributed:** Able to handle requests originating from multiple clients and routed through multiple servers.
*   **Configurable:** Able to support different rate limits for different API endpoints or client types.
*   **Fault-tolerant:** Able to continue operating even if some components fail.
*   **Adaptive:** Able to dynamically adjust rate limits based on the observed performance of the backend services.
*   **Efficient:** Able to process requests with minimal latency overhead.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Rate Limit Definition:** The rate limiter should support defining rate limits based on:

    *   API Endpoint (e.g., `/users`, `/products`)
    *   Client ID (identifying the source of the request)
    *   A combination of API Endpoint and Client ID
    *   Global rate limits (applied to all requests)

    Rate limits should be specified as a maximum number of requests per time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour).

2.  **Request Processing:** When a request arrives at the rate limiter, the system should:

    *   Identify the appropriate rate limits based on the request attributes (API Endpoint, Client ID).
    *   Check if the request exceeds any of the applicable rate limits.
    *   If the request is within the limits, allow it to proceed to the backend service.
    *   If the request exceeds the limits, reject it with an appropriate error code (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).
    *   Ensure that the rate limiting logic is atomic and thread-safe across the distributed system.

3.  **Distributed Architecture:** The rate limiter should be deployed as a distributed system, with multiple rate limiter instances handling requests.  Consider using a distributed cache or database (e.g., Redis, Cassandra) to store rate limit counters and ensure consistency across instances.  Describe the chosen architecture and the rationale behind it.

4.  **Adaptive Throttling:** The rate limiter should monitor the performance of the backend services (e.g., response time, error rate). If the backend services are overloaded (e.g., response time exceeds a threshold, error rate increases), the rate limiter should automatically reduce the rate limits to protect the services.  When the backend services recover, the rate limits should be gradually increased back to their original values. The adaptation mechanism should be configurable and tunable. The adaptation should consider both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be designed to handle failures of individual rate limiter instances. If an instance fails, requests should be automatically routed to other healthy instances. The system should also be able to recover from failures of the distributed cache or database.

6.  **Optimization:**

    *   Minimize the latency overhead introduced by the rate limiter.
    *   Optimize the storage space used by the rate limiter.
    *   Design the system to handle a high volume of requests.

7.  **Edge Cases and Constraints:**

    *   Handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.
    *   Ensure that rate limits are enforced accurately, even with clock skew across different servers.
    *   Consider the impact of network latency on the rate limiting logic.
    *   Implement a mechanism to prevent abuse of the adaptive throttling feature.
    *   Handle scenarios where the backend services are temporarily unavailable.
    *   Ensure the system is thread-safe and handles race conditions correctly.

8.  **Report**
    *   Provide a design document explaining the architecture, algorithms, and data structures used.
    *   Describe the trade-offs made in the design.
    *   Discuss the scalability, performance, and fault tolerance of the system.
    *   Explain how the adaptive throttling mechanism works.
    *   Identify potential areas for improvement.

**Focus on the core logic and algorithms for rate limiting and adaptive throttling.  You don't need to implement a full-fledged production system, but your design should be realistic and address the key challenges of building a distributed rate limiter.**

## Question: Distributed Transaction Manager

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory, distributed transaction manager. This system is responsible for coordinating transactions across multiple independent services. Each service can perform operations that may modify its local data. To ensure data consistency across all services, the transaction manager must implement the **two-phase commit (2PC) protocol**.

**System Architecture:**

*   **Transaction Manager (TM):** The central component that coordinates transactions. It receives transaction requests from clients, orchestrates the prepare and commit/rollback phases, and communicates with the participating services.
*   **Services (Participants):** Independent services that perform operations as part of a transaction. Each service maintains its own local data and can vote to commit or rollback a transaction.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** The TM should be able to receive transaction requests from clients. Each request will contain a unique transaction ID and a list of operations to be performed on different services. An operation is represented by a service ID and a data payload (String for simplicity).

2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** Implement the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity.

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):**
        *   The TM sends a "prepare" message to all participating services, including the list of operations they need to execute locally.
        *   Each service attempts to tentatively execute the operations. If successful, it logs the changes in a local "undo" log (in-memory for this problem) and sends a "vote-commit" message back to the TM. If any operation fails or the service is unable to prepare (e.g., due to resource constraints), it sends a "vote-abort" message.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):**
        *   If the TM receives "vote-commit" messages from *all* participating services, it sends a "commit" message to all services.  Each service then makes the changes permanent.
        *   If the TM receives at least one "vote-abort" message, or if any service fails to respond within a reasonable timeout, it sends a "rollback" message to all services. Each service then uses the "undo" log to revert the tentative changes.

3.  **Concurrency:** The TM should be able to handle concurrent transaction requests. You need to ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions when managing transaction states and communicating with services.

4.  **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to deal with service failures, network issues, and other potential problems. The TM should be able to recover from failures and ensure data consistency.  Services might be temporarily unavailable. The TM should retry prepare requests for a certain number of attempts before aborting a transaction.

5.  **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for all communication steps (prepare, commit, rollback). If a service does not respond within a specified timeout, the TM should consider the service as failed and trigger a rollback.

6.  **Idempotency:** The services need to handle commit and rollback messages idempotently. The TM might send the same commit/rollback message multiple times due to network issues or retries.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be implemented in Java.
*   All communication between the TM and services should be simulated using in-memory data structures (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, BlockingQueue). You do not need to implement actual network communication.
*   Assume a fixed number of services and their corresponding service IDs.
*   The number of operations per transaction can be large.
*   The size of the data payload for each operation can be significant. Consider how this affects memory usage.
*   Implement a retry mechanism for prepare requests with a maximum number of retries and a backoff strategy (e.g., exponential backoff).
*   Assume that services never crash *during* the commit or rollback phases, only before they respond to a prepare request.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure data consistency.
*   Concurrency: The solution must handle concurrent transaction requests efficiently and safely.
*   Error Handling: The solution must handle service failures and network issues gracefully.
*   Performance: The solution should minimize the latency of transaction processing. Consider potential bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling.  A naive implementation will likely suffer from performance issues or race conditions. A successful solution will demonstrate a thoughtful design, efficient implementation, and robust error handling. Good luck!

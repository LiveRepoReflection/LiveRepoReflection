## Problem:  Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a scenario where multiple services need to update their local data as part of a single, atomic operation.  If any service fails to update its data, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

You are given `n` microservices, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `n-1`.  Each service has a local database.  A global transaction involves updating data in a subset of these services.

Your system must implement the following functionalities:

1. **Transaction Initiation:**  A client initiates a transaction by providing a list of service IDs involved in the transaction and the data update operation (represented as a string) to be performed by each service.

2. **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):**  Implement a simplified version of the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity.
    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):** The coordinator (your implementation) sends a "prepare" message containing the data update operation to all participating services. Each service attempts to apply the update *tentatively* (e.g., by writing to a staging area or shadow table).  If successful, the service sends back a "vote-commit" message to the coordinator. If the service fails (e.g., due to data validation errors, resource constraints, or network issues), it sends back a "vote-abort" message.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):**
        *   If the coordinator receives "vote-commit" messages from *all* participating services, it sends a "commit" message to all services.  Each service then *permanently* applies the tentatively staged update.
        *   If the coordinator receives at least one "vote-abort" message, or if any service fails to respond within a specified timeout, it sends a "rollback" message to all participating services.  Each service then discards the tentatively staged update.

3.  **Concurrency:** The coordinator should be able to handle multiple concurrent transactions.  You must ensure proper synchronization to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

4.  **Failure Handling:**  The system must handle service failures gracefully.  If a service fails to respond during the prepare phase or commit/rollback phase, the coordinator should assume the service will not commit and initiate a rollback for all other participants.

5.  **Data Persistence (Optional, Bonus):** Ideally, implement a mechanism to persist the coordinator's state (e.g., using a log file) so that it can recover from its own failures. This is a bonus requirement and not essential for a correct solution.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of services, `n`, will be between 1 and 100.
*   The number of participating services in a transaction will be between 1 and `n`.
*   The data update operation string will be no more than 256 characters.
*   You must provide a way to simulate service failures during testing.
*   The coordinator must handle concurrent transactions safely.

**Input:**

The input will be provided programmatically via method calls to your coordinator implementation. It will consist of:

*   A list of service IDs participating in the transaction.
*   The data update operation string.

**Output:**

Your coordinator implementation should return a boolean value indicating whether the transaction was successfully committed (`true`) or rolled back (`false`).

**Specific Requirements:**

*   Implement the `DistributedTransactionCoordinator` class with methods to initiate and manage transactions.
*   Assume that each service has a method called `prepare(transactionId, data)` which returns a boolean indicating whether the service successfully prepared.
*   Assume that each service has a method called `commit(transactionId)` which performs the permanent update.
*   Assume that each service has a method called `rollback(transactionId)` which discards the tentative update.
*   Assume that each service has a method called `isAlive()` which returns a boolean indicating whether the service is currently available.  This method is used for failure simulation.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling.  It's crucial to consider all possible failure scenarios and design a robust and reliable solution. Good luck!

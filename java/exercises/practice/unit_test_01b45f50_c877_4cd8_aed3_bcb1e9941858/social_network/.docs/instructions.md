Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be similar in difficulty to a LeetCode Hard problem, incorporating multiple aspects for increased complexity.

**Project Name:** `ScalableSocialNetworkGraph`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a scalable graph data structure to represent a social network. This data structure must support efficient retrieval of user connections and recommendations, even with billions of users and connections.

Specifically, you need to implement a class called `SocialNetworkGraph` that provides the following functionalities:

1.  **`addUser(long userId)`:**  Adds a new user to the social network. User IDs are unique positive integers. If the user already exists, this method should do nothing.

2.  **`addConnection(long userId1, long userId2)`:** Adds a bidirectional connection (friendship) between two users. If either user does not exist, create them first. If the connection already exists, this method should do nothing. The graph should not allow self-loops (a user connecting to themselves).

3.  **`removeConnection(long userId1, long userId2)`:** Removes the connection between two users. If either user or the connection does not exist, this method should do nothing.

4.  **`getFriends(long userId)`:** Returns a sorted list of the user's friends (connected users' IDs) in ascending order. If the user does not exist, return an empty list. This method needs to be optimized for speed.

5.  **`getMutualFriends(long userId1, long userId2)`:** Returns a sorted list of mutual friends (friends shared by both users) in ascending order. If either user does not exist, return an empty list. This method also needs to be optimized for speed.

6.  **`getRecommendedFriends(long userId, int recommendationCount)`:** Returns a sorted list of recommended friends for a given user, excluding existing friends and the user themselves.  Recommendations are based on the number of mutual friends a non-friend has with the user. The returned list should contain the `recommendationCount` users with the most mutual friends, sorted in descending order of mutual friend count. If there is a tie in the number of mutual friends, the user with the smaller ID should be ranked higher. If the user has fewer than `recommendationCount` possible recommendations, return all possible recommendations.  If the user does not exist, return an empty list. This method should also be optimized for speed.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:**  The data structure should be designed to handle a very large number of users (billions) and connections. Consider memory usage and algorithmic efficiency carefully.
*   **Efficiency:**  The `getFriends`, `getMutualFriends`, and `getRecommendedFriends` methods must be optimized for speed.  Naive implementations will likely time out on large datasets.  Think about appropriate data structures and algorithms for these operations.
*   **Memory Usage:**  Minimize memory consumption.  Consider using appropriate data types (e.g., `long` instead of `Integer` where appropriate) and data structures.
*   **Concurrency (Optional):** While not strictly required, consider how your solution could be made thread-safe or concurrent, anticipating that multiple threads might access and modify the graph simultaneously in a real-world social network application.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., non-existent users, empty friend lists, etc.).
*   **Sorting:** Result lists must be sorted as specified.
*   **`recommendationCount`:** is a positive integer.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Does your implementation produce the correct results for all test cases?
*   **Time Complexity:**  How efficiently do your methods perform, especially for large datasets?
*   **Space Complexity:**  How much memory does your solution consume?
*   **Code Quality:**  Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a good understanding of graph data structures, algorithms for graph traversal and analysis, and optimization techniques for handling large datasets. It also touches upon system design considerations related to scalability and concurrency. Good luck!

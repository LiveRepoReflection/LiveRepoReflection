`DistributedTransactionCoordinator`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed transaction coordinator for a simplified banking system. This system involves multiple independent bank services (simulated within a single Java application) that need to participate in atomic transactions.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a user wants to transfer funds from their account in Bank A to another user's account in Bank B. These banks are independent services. To ensure data consistency, the transfer must be atomic: either the funds are successfully debited from Bank A and credited to Bank B, or the entire operation is rolled back, leaving both accounts in their original states.

**Your Task:**

You need to implement a transaction coordinator that orchestrates these distributed transactions, adhering to the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.  Each bank service will implement a simple interface you define.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Bank Service Interface:** Define an interface `BankService` with methods for:
    *   `prepare(transactionId)`:  Indicates the bank service to prepare for a transaction. It performs necessary checks (e.g., sufficient funds) and reserves resources but does *not* commit anything permanently. Returns `true` if prepared successfully, `false` otherwise.
    *   `commit(transactionId)`:  Commits the transaction, making the changes permanent.
    *   `rollback(transactionId)`:  Rolls back the transaction, releasing any reserved resources and reverting to the original state.

2.  **Transaction Coordinator:** Implement a `TransactionCoordinator` class with methods for:
    *   `beginTransaction()`: Generates a unique transaction ID and starts a new transaction.
    *   `enlistBankService(transactionId, BankService bankService)`: Registers a bank service to participate in the specified transaction.
    *   `transfer(transactionId, fromBankService, fromAccountId, toBankService, toAccountId, amount)`: Executes the transfer operation. This method orchestrates the 2PC protocol:
        *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):**  Sends a `prepare()` request to all enlisted bank services for the given transaction.
        *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):** If all bank services successfully prepared, send a `commit()` request to all enlisted services. Otherwise, send a `rollback()` request to all enlisted services.
    *   `endTransaction(transactionId)`: Cleans up any resources associated with the transaction.

3.  **Concurrency:** The transaction coordinator must handle concurrent transactions safely and efficiently.  Consider using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.

4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.  If a bank service fails to prepare, commit, or rollback, the transaction coordinator must handle the failure gracefully and ensure data consistency (e.g., by retrying or logging the error).

5.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism. If a bank service doesn't respond within a reasonable time during the prepare phase, consider it a failure and initiate a rollback.

6.  **Idempotency:** Implement idempotency in the `commit()` and `rollback()` methods of the `BankService`. This means that if the transaction coordinator sends a commit/rollback request multiple times due to network issues, the bank service should be able to handle it correctly without causing any inconsistencies.

7.  **Optimizations (Important):**
    *   **Asynchronous Communication:**  Optimize the prepare phase by sending prepare requests to bank services concurrently using threads or an ExecutorService.  Waiting for each service sequentially will be too slow.
    *   **Logging:** Implement a basic logging mechanism to record transaction events (begin, prepare, commit, rollback, failures).  This will aid in debugging and auditing.

8.  **Simulated Bank Services:** You will also need to create some example implementations of the `BankService` interface to test your coordinator. These can be simple in-memory implementations.  Ensure they simulate potential failures (e.g., insufficient funds, network errors).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the transaction coordinator correctly implement the 2PC protocol and guarantee atomicity?
*   Concurrency: Does the coordinator handle concurrent transactions safely and efficiently?
*   Error Handling: Does the coordinator handle failures gracefully and maintain data consistency?
*   Performance: Is the prepare phase optimized using asynchronous communication?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Idempotency: Does the `BankService` implement idempotent commit/rollback operations?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java problem designed to test a wide range of skills, aiming for LeetCode Hard difficulty.

**Problem Title:** Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Simulation

**Problem Description:**

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) operates based on proposals and voting. Your task is to simulate the core logic of a simplified DAO, focusing on proposal submission, voting, and execution.

A DAO has a set of members, each identified by a unique integer ID, and an initial treasury of digital assets. Proposals can be submitted to the DAO to perform specific actions, such as transferring assets between accounts, adding new members, or modifying DAO parameters. Each proposal requires a quorum of votes to pass.

You are given the following:

*   A list of initial DAO member IDs.
*   An initial treasury balance (a long integer).
*   A series of proposals.

Each proposal has the following attributes:

*   `proposalId`: A unique integer identifying the proposal.
*   `proposerId`: The ID of the member who submitted the proposal.
*   `actionType`: An enum representing the type of action the proposal aims to perform (`TRANSFER_ASSETS`, `ADD_MEMBER`, `MODIFY_QUORUM`).
*   `actionDetails`: A string containing details specific to the action. The format of this string depends on the `actionType`.
    *   `TRANSFER_ASSETS`: `"recipientId,amount"` (e.g., `"123,1000"`).  Transfers `amount` from the DAO treasury to member `recipientId`.
    *   `ADD_MEMBER`: `"newMemberId"` (e.g., `"456"`). Adds `newMemberId` to the DAO's membership.
    *   `MODIFY_QUORUM`: `"newQuorumPercentage"` (e.g., `"60"`). Changes the quorum percentage to `newQuorumPercentage`.
*   `votes`: A map of member ID to a boolean value indicating their vote (true = yes, false = no). Only DAO members can vote.
*   `startTimestamp`: A long representing the unix timestamp when the voting started.
*   `endTimestamp`: A long representing the unix timestamp when the voting ended.

Your task is to implement a `DAO` class with the following methods:

1.  **`DAO(Set<Integer> initialMembers, long initialTreasury, int initialQuorumPercentage)`:** Constructor to initialize the DAO.  The `initialQuorumPercentage` represents the percentage of members that need to vote "yes" for a proposal to pass (e.g., 60 means at least 60% of the members must vote yes).

2.  **`boolean submitProposal(Proposal proposal, long currentTimestamp)`:** Submits a proposal to the DAO.
    *   A proposal is only valid if the proposer is a current member of the DAO.
    *   A proposal is only valid if the `startTimestamp` is in the past and `endTimestamp` is in the future with respect to the `currentTimestamp`.
    *   If the proposal is valid, process the votes and execute the proposal if it passes the quorum.
    *   Return `true` if the proposal is successfully submitted and processed (whether passed or failed), `false` otherwise.

3.  **`long getTreasuryBalance()`:** Returns the current treasury balance.

4.  **`Set<Integer> getMembers()`:** Returns a set containing the IDs of all current DAO members.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Concurrency:**  Assume that multiple threads can call `submitProposal` concurrently.  Implement appropriate synchronization to maintain data consistency.
*   **Invalid Actions:**  Handle cases where a proposal requests an invalid action (e.g., transferring more assets than available in the treasury, adding a member that already exists, setting an invalid quorum percentage (not between 0 and 100)). Invalid actions should cause the proposal to fail, even if it meets the quorum.
*   **Quorum Calculation:**  The quorum is calculated based on the *current* number of members at the *end* of the voting period, not at the beginning.
*   **Timeouts:** Voting period should be validated based on current Timestamp.
*   **Atomic Operations:** All operations within a successful proposal execution must be atomic. If any part of the execution fails, the entire proposal execution should be rolled back to maintain consistency.
*   **Large Scale:** Design your solution to handle a large number of members (up to 10<sup>6</sup>) and a high volume of proposals.  Consider the memory footprint and efficiency of your data structures.
*   **Integer Overflow:** Prevent integer overflow when calculating vote counts or transferring assets.
*   **Re-entrancy:** Prevent any potential re-entrancy issues that might arise from the interactions between different parts of the DAO.
*   **Treasury Limits:** Treasury balance can never be negative.
*   **Unordered Votes:** The votes in the proposal may not be ordered by member ID.
*   **Duplicate Votes:** A member might vote multiple times in the proposal. Consider only the most recent vote of each member.

**Example `Proposal` Class:**

```java
enum ActionType {
    TRANSFER_ASSETS,
    ADD_MEMBER,
    MODIFY_QUORUM
}

class Proposal {
    public int proposalId;
    public int proposerId;
    public ActionType actionType;
    public String actionDetails;
    public Map<Integer, Boolean> votes;
    public long startTimestamp;
    public long endTimestamp;

    public Proposal(int proposalId, int proposerId, ActionType actionType, String actionDetails, Map<Integer, Boolean> votes, long startTimestamp, long endTimestamp) {
        this.proposalId = proposalId;
        this.proposerId = proposerId;
        this.actionType = actionType;
        this.actionDetails = actionDetails;
        this.votes = votes;
        this.startTimestamp = startTimestamp;
        this.endTimestamp = endTimestamp;
    }
}
```

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and error handling, making it a challenging and realistic programming exercise. Good luck!

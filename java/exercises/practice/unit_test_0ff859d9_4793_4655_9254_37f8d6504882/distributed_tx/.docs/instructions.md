Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Manager

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager. Imagine a system where multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.), each residing on a different node, need to participate in a single, atomic transaction.  Either all services commit their changes, or all roll back, ensuring data consistency across the distributed system.

Your transaction manager will coordinate these services using a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol. You need to implement the core logic for coordinating these distributed transactions.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Participants (Resource Managers):** Assume you have a set of `ResourceManager` interfaces, each representing a service participating in the transaction.  These resource managers expose the following methods:

    *   `prepare(TransactionID transactionId)`:  The transaction manager calls this on each resource manager, asking it to prepare to commit the transaction. The resource manager should perform necessary checks (e.g., sufficient funds in a database account), and tentatively apply the changes (e.g., write to a write-ahead log), but *not* permanently commit them. It should return `true` if prepared successfully, `false` otherwise.  A ResourceManager *must* be idempotent in its prepare phase.
    *   `commit(TransactionID transactionId)`:  If all resource managers prepare successfully, the transaction manager calls this on each resource manager, instructing it to permanently commit the transaction. A ResourceManager *must* be idempotent in its commit phase.
    *   `rollback(TransactionID transactionId)`: If any resource manager fails to prepare, or if the transaction manager decides to abort the transaction for any reason, it calls this on each resource manager, instructing it to undo any changes made during the prepare phase. A ResourceManager *must* be idempotent in its rollback phase.
    *   `recover(TransactionID transactionId)`: (Important for fault tolerance!) Called during system startup to check if a transaction was left in an uncertain state (prepared but not committed/rolled back).  The resource manager should return the `TransactionState` (see below) of the given transaction.
    *   `TransactionState`: enum with values `PREPARED`, `COMMITTED`, `ROLLEDBACK`, `UNKNOWN`.

2.  **Transaction Manager:** You need to implement a `TransactionManager` class with the following methods:

    *   `begin()`: Starts a new transaction and returns a `TransactionID`.
    *   `enlist(TransactionID transactionId, ResourceManager resourceManager)`:  Adds a resource manager to the transaction.
    *   `commit(TransactionID transactionId)`:  Attempts to commit the transaction.  This involves the 2PC protocol. Returns `true` on success, `false` on failure.
    *   `rollback(TransactionID transactionId)`:  Rolls back the transaction.
    *   `recover()`:  **Fault Tolerance Requirement:** This method is called during transaction manager startup.  It should iterate through all resource managers and call their `recover()` method for all known `TransactionID`s.  Based on the recovered states, it should attempt to complete or rollback any in-flight transactions (transactions that were in the PREPARED state at the time of the crash). This is crucial for ensuring data consistency after a system failure.

3.  **TransactionID:** A simple class or interface representing a unique identifier for a transaction.  You can use `UUID`.

4.  **Concurrency:** Your `TransactionManager` must be thread-safe. Multiple transactions can be initiated and processed concurrently.

5.  **Logging:**  Implement basic logging for key events (transaction begin, prepare, commit, rollback, recovery). This will help in debugging and understanding the system's behavior.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Idempotency:**  The `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods of the `ResourceManager` *must* be idempotent. This is essential for handling failures during the 2PC protocol.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The `recover()` method is critical. Your implementation must be able to handle scenarios where the transaction manager crashes after some resource managers have prepared but before others have committed.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:**  Consider the possibility of deadlocks.  While you don't need to implement full deadlock detection and resolution, be aware of the potential issue and document your design choices regarding concurrency and locking.
*   **Resource Manager Failure:** Your Transaction Manager does *not* need to handle cases where Resource Managers fail and are unrecoverable. Assume resource managers can always be contacted (eventually) and are able to properly recover their state.
*   **Efficiency:** The `prepare` phase should be optimized. Avoid unnecessary locking or blocking operations.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the transaction manager correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does the `recover()` method correctly handle system crashes and ensure data consistency?
*   Concurrency:  Is the `TransactionManager` thread-safe and can handle concurrent transactions?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Logging: Does the logging provide sufficient information for debugging and understanding the system's behavior?
*   Efficiency: Is the solution reasonably efficient, minimizing unnecessary overhead?

This problem combines elements of distributed systems, concurrency, and fault tolerance, requiring a deep understanding of transactional principles and careful implementation to achieve a robust and efficient solution. Good luck!

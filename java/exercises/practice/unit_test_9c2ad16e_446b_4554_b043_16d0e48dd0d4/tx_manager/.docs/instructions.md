Okay, here is a challenging Java coding problem:

## Project Name

`DistributedTransactionManager`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed transaction manager. This system will be responsible for ensuring the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties of transactions that span multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.).

Specifically, implement a simplified Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. The system should support:

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** A client initiates a transaction. The transaction manager assigns a unique transaction ID (TID).
2.  **Resource Registration:** Participants (services involved in the transaction) register with the transaction manager, providing their unique participant ID (PID) and a method to prepare and commit/rollback the transaction. Each participant must be idempotent in their prepare, commit, and rollback operations.
3.  **Prepare Phase:** When the client signals to commit the transaction, the transaction manager sends a `PREPARE` message to all registered participants. Participants execute their local prepare logic and respond with either `VOTE_COMMIT` or `VOTE_ABORT`.
4.  **Commit/Rollback Phase:**
    *   If all participants vote to commit (`VOTE_COMMIT`), the transaction manager sends a `COMMIT` message to all participants. Participants execute their local commit logic.
    *   If any participant votes to abort (`VOTE_ABORT`), or if the transaction manager times out waiting for responses during the prepare phase, the transaction manager sends a `ROLLBACK` message to all participants. Participants execute their local rollback logic.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The transaction manager needs to be reasonably fault-tolerant. Implement mechanisms to handle participant failures and transaction manager crashes. Assume participants persist their prepare state.
6.  **Logging:** Maintain a transaction log to track the state of each transaction. This log should be used to recover the transaction manager's state after a crash. The log should include at a minimum TID, PIDs of the participants and the decisions made during the prepare phase.

**Constraints:**

*   **Concurrency:** The transaction manager must handle concurrent transactions.
*   **Scalability:**  While this is a simplified version, consider the scalability implications of your design.
*   **Idempotency:** You MUST ensure participants can handle duplicate commit/rollback requests without adverse effects.
*   **Timeouts:** Implement reasonable timeouts for all operations (e.g., waiting for participant responses).  If a timeout occurs during the prepare phase, the transaction should be rolled back.
*   **No distributed consensus algorithms (like Paxos or Raft) are allowed for this simplified version.** Assume a single, reliable transaction manager.
*   **Simplicity:**  Focus on the core 2PC logic. Avoid over-engineering.
*   **Participants are dumb.** They only know how to prepare, commit, and rollback when instructed by the transaction manager. They do not communicate amongst themselves.

**Requirements:**

*   Provide clear interfaces for participants to register and interact with the transaction manager.
*   Provide a mechanism for clients to initiate transactions and signal commit/rollback.
*   Implement proper logging and recovery mechanisms.
*   Design your system to handle potential participant failures during the commit/rollback phase. The transaction manager should retry sending commit/rollback messages to failed participants after a timeout period.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Participant crashes *after* voting to commit but *before* receiving the commit message.
*   Transaction manager crashes *after* sending the commit message but *before* all participants have committed.
*   Participant crashes during prepare phase.
*   Network partitions preventing communication between the transaction manager and some participants. (Simulate this with delays).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the latency of the commit protocol.  While perfect optimization isn't required, consider strategies to improve performance.
*   Minimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Logging should not become a bottleneck.

**Real-world Practical Scenarios:**

Imagine a scenario where you're booking a flight and a hotel.  The flight booking service and the hotel booking service are independent.  A distributed transaction ensures that either both bookings succeed or both fail, preventing inconsistent states (e.g., a flight booked but no hotel).

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Think about the data structures you'll use to store transaction state.
*   Consider how you'll handle concurrent access to these data structures.
*   Design your logging mechanism to be efficient and reliable.

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The core commit/rollback logic should be reasonably efficient (e.g., avoid O(n^2) operations where possible).

**Multiple Valid Approaches with Different Trade-offs:**

*   You could use in-memory data structures for transaction state, trading off durability for performance.
*   You could use a more robust logging mechanism (e.g., write-ahead logging) for increased durability, at the cost of increased complexity.
*   You could implement different retry strategies for failed participants (e.g., exponential backoff).

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

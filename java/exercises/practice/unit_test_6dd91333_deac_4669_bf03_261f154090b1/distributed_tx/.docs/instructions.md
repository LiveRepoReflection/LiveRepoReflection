## The Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a scenario where multiple microservices need to update their local databases as part of a single, atomic transaction.  If any of the services fail to update, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

Your DTC should implement the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. Assume a simplified messaging system exists for communication between the DTC and the participating microservices (participants).

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** The DTC receives a transaction request containing a unique transaction ID and a list of participating microservice endpoints (URLs).

2.  **Phase 1: Prepare Phase:**
    *   The DTC sends a "PREPARE" message to each participant, including the transaction ID.
    *   Each participant attempts to perform its part of the transaction (e.g., update its database).
    *   Each participant responds with either a "VOTE_COMMIT" or "VOTE_ABORT" message to the DTC, along with the transaction ID. The participant must persist its vote decision locally, before sending it to DTC.  If a participant crashes before voting, it should recover its decision upon restart based on the persisted vote.
    *   A participant can only vote "VOTE_ABORT" during the PREPARE phase.

3.  **Phase 2: Commit/Abort Phase:**
    *   If the DTC receives "VOTE_COMMIT" from *all* participants, it enters the COMMIT phase and sends a "COMMIT" message to all participants, including the transaction ID.
    *   If the DTC receives "VOTE_ABORT" from *any* participant, or if any participant fails to respond within a specified timeout, it enters the ABORT phase and sends an "ABORT" message to all participants, including the transaction ID.
    *   Each participant, upon receiving a "COMMIT" message, permanently commits its changes. Upon receiving an "ABORT" message, each participant rolls back any changes it made during the prepare phase. Both outcomes need to be persisted.

4.  **Error Handling and Fault Tolerance:**
    *   Implement appropriate timeouts for participant responses. If a timeout occurs in the PREPARE phase, treat it as a "VOTE_ABORT". If the DTC crashes after sending out "COMMIT" or "ABORT" messages but before receiving acknowledgements, upon restart, it must resend the same decision to ensure eventual consistency.
    *   Handle network errors and other potential exceptions gracefully.
    *   The DTC should maintain a log of transactions and their states to recover from crashes.

5.  **Concurrency:** The DTC should be able to handle multiple concurrent transactions.

6.  **Durability:** Ensure transaction state is persisted to disk, such that the DTC can recover and resume operations after a restart.

**Constraints:**

*   The messaging system is unreliable. Messages can be lost or delayed.
*   Participants can crash and recover.
*   The DTC can crash and recover.
*   Assume that participants are idempotent with respect to commit and abort operations. They can safely receive and execute the same "COMMIT" or "ABORT" message multiple times.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the latency of transaction completion. Consider strategies for parallelizing operations where possible.
*   Minimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O).

**Real-World Practical Scenarios:**

*   Consider a scenario where a user is placing an order in an e-commerce system. The order service, payment service, and inventory service all need to update their databases as part of the order placement transaction.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Think about the data structures you'll need to manage transaction states, participant information, and logs.
*   Consider the scalability of your DTC design. How would it handle a large number of concurrent transactions and participants?

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The DTC should be able to handle a reasonable number of concurrent transactions with acceptable performance.  O(n) or better, where n is the number of participants, should be aimed for in core operations.

**Multiple Valid Approaches with Different Trade-offs:**

*   There are multiple ways to implement the DTC and the 2PC protocol. Some approaches may prioritize performance, while others prioritize simplicity or fault tolerance.  Consider the trade-offs of different design choices.

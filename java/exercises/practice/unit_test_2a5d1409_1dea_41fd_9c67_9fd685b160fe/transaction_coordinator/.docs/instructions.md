Okay, here's your challenging Java programming competition problem.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) for a microservices architecture.  Several independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) need to participate in atomic transactions. Atomicity means that either all operations across these services succeed (commit), or all operations are rolled back (abort), even in the presence of failures. Your DTC should implement a simplified version of the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

**System Architecture:**

*   **Participants:** A set of distributed services (simulated in-memory). Each service can perform a single operation within a transaction (e.g., update a database record, enqueue a message). Services register themselves with the DTC.
*   **Transaction Requestor:** A client initiates a transaction by sending a request to the DTC. The request specifies the services involved and the operations to be performed on each service.
*   **DTC (Your Task):** The Distributed Transaction Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the transaction across all participating services. It implements the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity.

**Simplified Two-Phase Commit Protocol:**

1.  **Transaction Start:** The client sends a transaction request to the DTC. The DTC assigns a unique transaction ID (TXID) to the transaction.
2.  **Prepare Phase:** The DTC sends a "prepare" message to each participating service, along with the TXID and a description of the operation to be performed.
3.  **Service Response:**
    *   Each service attempts to perform the operation.
    *   If the service succeeds, it enters a "prepared" state, logs the operation (for potential rollback), and sends a "vote-commit" message back to the DTC, along with the TXID.
    *   If the service fails (due to any reason, e.g., data conflict, resource unavailability), it sends a "vote-abort" message back to the DTC, along with the TXID. The service doesn't need to explicitly roll back at this stage, it just signals a failure.
4.  **Commit/Abort Decision:**
    *   **Commit:** If the DTC receives "vote-commit" messages from *all* participating services, it decides to commit the transaction.
    *   **Abort:** If the DTC receives *at least one* "vote-abort" message, or if any service fails to respond within a specified timeout, it decides to abort the transaction.
5.  **Commit/Abort Phase:**
    *   The DTC sends a "commit" or "abort" message to all participating services, along with the TXID.
    *   Upon receiving a "commit" message, each service permanently applies the operation that it had prepared.
    *   Upon receiving an "abort" message, each service rolls back the operation that it had prepared (if it hasn't already).
6.  **Completion:** Each service sends an "ack" message to the DTC upon completing the commit or rollback.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Implement the DTC:**  Create a `DistributedTransactionCoordinator` class that manages the transaction lifecycle.
2.  **Service Interface:** Define a simple interface `TransactionParticipant` for services to implement.  This interface should have methods for `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback`.
3.  **Transaction Request:** Create a `TransactionRequest` class that encapsulates the information needed to initiate a transaction (service names, operations to perform).
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to deal with service failures, network issues, and timeouts.  The DTC must be able to handle situations where services become unavailable during the transaction process.
5.  **Concurrency:** The DTC must be thread-safe and able to handle multiple concurrent transaction requests. Consider using appropriate synchronization mechanisms.
6.  **Logging:** Implement basic logging to track the progress of transactions and any errors that occur. This is crucial for debugging and auditing.
7.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for the prepare phase. If a service doesn't respond within the timeout, the transaction should be aborted.
8.  **Idempotency (Crucial):** Your design *must* ensure that the commit and rollback operations are idempotent. This means that if a service receives a commit or rollback message multiple times (due to network issues or DTC retries), it should only apply the operation once.  Think carefully about how to achieve this.

**Constraints:**

*   Simulate the distributed services in memory.  You don't need to connect to real databases or message queues.  Use simple data structures (e.g., `Map`, `List`) to represent the state of the services.
*   Assume a relatively small number of services (e.g., less than 10).
*   Focus on the core 2PC logic and error handling.  You don't need to implement advanced features like transaction recovery or distributed locking.
*   Optimize for *correctness* and *robustness* over raw performance. However, avoid obviously inefficient solutions.
*   The implementation should be as simple as possible given the constraints and requirements. Avoid over-engineering.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine three services: a user service, an order service, and an inventory service. A transaction might involve creating a new user account, placing an order for that user, and decrementing the inventory count for the ordered items.  If any of these operations fail, the entire transaction must be rolled back.

**Bonus Points:**

*   Implement a retry mechanism for failed commit/abort operations.
*   Implement a simple recovery mechanism to handle DTC failures.  If the DTC crashes and restarts, it should be able to resume any in-flight transactions.
*   Provide a mechanism for manually forcing a commit or abort of a transaction in exceptional circumstances.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem:

**Title: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Resource Constraints**

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduling algorithm for a distributed computing system. The system consists of a cluster of machines, each with limited resources (CPU cores, memory). You are given a set of tasks to execute. Each task has the following properties:

*   `id`: Unique identifier for the task (String).
*   `cpu_cores`: The number of CPU cores required to execute the task (integer).
*   `memory`: The amount of memory (in GB) required to execute the task (integer).
*   `dependencies`: A set of task `id`s that must be completed before this task can start (Set<String>). A task cannot start until all of its dependencies are finished.
*   `execution_time`: The time (in seconds) it takes to execute the task if allocated its required resources (integer).

You are also given a list of machines, each described by:

*   `id`: Unique identifier for the machine (String).
*   `cpu_cores`: The total number of CPU cores available on the machine (integer).
*   `memory`: The total amount of memory (in GB) available on the machine (integer).

**Objective:**

Your goal is to design an algorithm that schedules the tasks onto the machines to minimize the overall makespan (the time when the last task finishes executing). The scheduler must adhere to the following constraints:

1.  **Resource Constraints:** A task can only be assigned to a machine if the machine has sufficient CPU cores and memory available.
2.  **Dependency Constraints:** A task can only start executing after all its dependencies have been completed.
3.  **Non-Preemption:** Once a task starts executing on a machine, it cannot be interrupted (preempted) until it completes.
4.  **Machine Capacity:** A Machine can execute multiple tasks at the same time, as long as the total resource requirements do not exceed available capacity.

**Input:**

*   A `List<Task>` representing the set of tasks.
*   A `List<Machine>` representing the cluster of machines.

**Output:**

*   An `int` representing the minimum makespan achieved by your task scheduling algorithm.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The number of tasks and machines can be large (up to 1000).
*   The execution time of tasks can vary significantly.
*   Dependencies can create complex task graphs (potentially cyclic). You should detect and handle cyclic dependencies gracefully (e.g., by throwing an exception or returning -1 to indicate an invalid task graph).
*   The algorithm should be as efficient as possible, both in terms of time and space complexity.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   Multiple optimal solutions might exist. Your algorithm should find one of the optimal solutions.
*   Think about how to efficiently represent the task dependencies and the resource availability on each machine.
*   Consider different scheduling strategies (e.g., greedy, priority-based, backtracking). Analyze the trade-offs between these strategies in terms of performance and complexity.
*   Your solution should be robust and handle various edge cases, such as empty task lists, empty machine lists, tasks with no dependencies, and machines with no resources.
*   Consider edge cases where no schedule is possible, such as when a task requires more resources than any machine can provide, or when there are cyclic dependencies.

This problem requires you to combine knowledge of graph algorithms (for dependency resolution), resource allocation strategies, and potentially dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to achieve the best possible makespan. Good luck!

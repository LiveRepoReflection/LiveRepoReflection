`DistributedRateLimiter`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter with the following specifications:

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a large-scale microservices architecture.  Each service needs to be protected from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. A centralized rate limiter is not feasible due to scalability and potential single point of failure issues. Therefore, you need a distributed rate limiter that can handle requests across multiple instances of the same service.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Functionality:** Implement a rate limiter that allows a configurable number of requests (`maxRequests`) within a specified time window (`timeWindowInSeconds`).

2.  **Distribution:** The rate limiter must work correctly across multiple instances of a service.  This implies that the state of request counts needs to be shared and consistent across all instances.

3.  **Granularity:**  The rate limiter should be able to limit requests based on a unique identifier, such as a user ID or API key (`clientId`).  Different clients may have different rate limits.

4.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter should be highly efficient, minimizing latency and resource consumption. Avoid unnecessary network calls and computations.

5.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple clients simultaneously.

6.  **Data Storage:**  Choose an appropriate data store for maintaining the request counts. Consider trade-offs between different data stores like Redis (in-memory data structure store), a relational database, or a custom solution. Justify your choice.

7.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be resilient to failures.  Consider how to handle temporary network issues or data store unavailability. Implement reasonable fallback mechanisms, such as allowing all requests temporarily or using a local cache with eventual consistency.

8.  **Atomic Operations:** Ensure that incrementing request counts is an atomic operation to prevent race conditions and ensure accurate rate limiting.

9. **Time Synchronization:** Given that it is a distributed system, consider potential time synchronization issues. How does your design accommodate slight time drifts between the different service instances?

**Input:**

*   `clientId`: A string representing the unique identifier for the client making the request.
*   `maxRequests`: An integer representing the maximum number of requests allowed within the time window.
*   `timeWindowInSeconds`: An integer representing the duration of the time window in seconds.

**Output:**

*   A boolean value: `true` if the request is allowed (i.e., within the rate limit), `false` otherwise.

**Constraints:**

*   Minimize external dependencies. If you use external libraries, explain your choices and their impact.
*   Optimize for performance and scalability. Your solution should handle a large number of requests per second with low latency.
*   Assume the `clientId` is a non-empty string.
*   `maxRequests` will be a positive integer.
*   `timeWindowInSeconds` will be a positive integer.
*   Consider the cost of your data storage solution and optimize data retention. Do you need to persist data indefinitely, or can you expire older records?
*   The solution should be stateless as much as possible.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement rate limiting based on weighted requests (e.g., different API endpoints have different costs).
*   Implement different rate limiting algorithms (e.g., Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window Counter, Sliding Window Counter).
*   Add metrics and monitoring to track the effectiveness of the rate limiter.
*   Handle burst traffic gracefully.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems principles, concurrency, data structures, and algorithms. A well-designed solution will need to consider trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance. Good luck!

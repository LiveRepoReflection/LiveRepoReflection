## The Quantum Network Optimization Problem

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and optimizing a quantum communication network. This network consists of `N` quantum nodes interconnected by quantum channels. Each quantum channel has a certain fidelity, representing the reliability of quantum information transfer. Furthermore, each node has a limited quantum memory capacity.

The network needs to support `K` quantum communication requests (QCRs). Each QCR requires establishing a quantum entangled connection (a "quantum path") between a source node and a destination node. Each quantum path is composed of one or more quantum channels.

The fidelity of a quantum path is the product of the fidelities of all the quantum channels constituting that path. The capacity of a node is the total number of QCRs that can be routed through that node.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that maximizes the overall network utility, which is defined as the sum of the fidelities of all established quantum paths, while respecting the quantum memory capacity constraints of each node.

**Specifically, you are given:**

*   `N`: The number of quantum nodes, numbered from 0 to N-1.
*   `K`: The number of quantum communication requests.
*   `channels`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, f)` represents a quantum channel between node `u` and node `v` with fidelity `f` (0 < `f` <= 1). The channels are bidirectional (i.e., if (u,v,f) exists, (v,u,f) also exists)
*   `requests`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(source, destination)` represents a quantum communication request between `source` and `destination` nodes.
*   `nodeCapacities`: An array of length `N`, where `nodeCapacities[i]` represents the maximum number of QCRs that can be routed through node `i`.

**Your task is to implement a function that:**

Takes `N`, `K`, `channels`, `requests`, and `nodeCapacities` as input.
Returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a quantum path for a corresponding QCR. Each quantum path should be a list of node indices, representing the sequence of nodes in the path from the source to the destination. If a QCR cannot be satisfied due to network limitations, return an empty list `[]` for that request.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Maximization of Overall Network Utility:** The primary goal is to maximize the sum of the fidelities of all established quantum paths.

2.  **Quantum Memory Capacity Constraints:** The number of QCRs routed through each node must not exceed its quantum memory capacity.

3.  **Path Selection:** For each QCR, you need to find a path from the source to the destination.  If multiple paths exist, you should choose the path that maximizes the path fidelity while considering the node capacity constraints.

4.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle networks with up to `N = 100` nodes and `K = 200` requests.  Naive solutions (e.g., brute-force) will likely time out.

5.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle cases where no path exists between a source and destination node.
    *   Handle cases where the network is disconnected.
    *   Handle cases where a QCR cannot be satisfied even if a path exists due to node capacity constraints.

6.  **Optimality:** While finding the absolute optimal solution might be computationally infeasible for larger networks, the algorithm should strive to find a solution that is as close to optimal as possible within reasonable time constraints. You can use heuristics or approximation algorithms to achieve this.

7.  **Fidelity Calculation:** The fidelity of a path is calculated by multiplying the fidelities of all the channels that constitute the path.

8.  **Node Usage:** A node is considered to be used by a QCR if it is part of the path for that QCR. Both the source and destination nodes are considered part of the path.

**Example:**

Let's consider a simplified example:

*   `N = 4` (Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3)
*   `K = 2`
*   `channels = [(0, 1, 0.9), (1, 2, 0.8), (2, 3, 0.7), (0, 3, 0.6)]`
*   `requests = [(0, 3), (1, 3)]`
*   `nodeCapacities = [2, 2, 2, 2]`

A possible valid output could be:

`[[0, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`

Explanation:

*   The first QCR (0 to 3) is routed directly through the channel (0, 3) with fidelity 0.6.
*   The second QCR (1 to 3) is routed through the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 with a fidelity of 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.

The overall network utility is 0.6 + 0.56 = 1.16.  Other valid solutions might exist with different utility values.

**This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (pathfinding), optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints to achieve a good solution within reasonable time limits.**

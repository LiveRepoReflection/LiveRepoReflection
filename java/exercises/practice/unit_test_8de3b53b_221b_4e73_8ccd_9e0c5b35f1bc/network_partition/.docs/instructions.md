Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be akin to a LeetCode Hard level question, focusing on algorithmic efficiency, data structures, and real-world constraints:

**Problem Title:** Network Partition for High-Availability

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a system to ensure high availability in a distributed network. The network consists of `N` nodes, labeled from `0` to `N-1`.  Each node represents a server and the connections between them represent communication channels. The network's topology can be represented as an undirected graph.

Due to potential failures, you need to partition the network into multiple independent sub-networks (components). When a network is partitioned, each node must belong to exactly one component. A component is considered independent if there is **no** communication channel between any two nodes belonging to different components.

Your goal is to find the **minimum number of nodes** you need to remove to disconnect the network into at least `K` independent components. Removing a node effectively removes all edges connected to that node.  You *cannot* remove edges directly without removing nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100` (Number of nodes)
*   `0 <= E <= N * (N - 1) / 2` (Number of edges)
*   `1 <= K <= N` (Minimum number of independent components required)
*   The graph is undirected and may contain cycles, but it does not contain self-loops or parallel edges.
*   Node removal cost is uniform (each node removal has a cost of 1).

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

1.  The first line contains two integers, `N` and `K`, representing the number of nodes and the minimum number of independent components required, respectively.
2.  The next `E` lines each contain two integers, `u` and `v`, representing an edge between node `u` and node `v`.

**Output:**

Print a single integer, representing the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to partition the network into at least `K` independent components. If it is impossible to partition the network into at least `K` components, print `-1`.

**Example:**

```
Input:
5 2
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4

Output:
1

Explanation:
Removing node '1' will partition the network into two components: {0} and {2, 3, 4}.

Input:
5 3
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4

Output:
2

Explanation:
Removing nodes '1' and '3' will partition the network into three components: {0}, {2}, and {4}.

Input:
3 4
0 1
1 2

Output:
-1

Explanation:
You cannot partition a network of 3 nodes into 4 components.
```

**Complexity Expectations:**

*   The problem requires an efficient solution to pass all test cases.  A naive solution will likely result in a timeout.
*   Consider using advanced graph algorithms and optimization techniques to achieve the required performance.  Think about how you can efficiently explore different node removal combinations.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness of the solution.
*   Efficiency of the solution (time complexity).
*   Adherence to the constraints.
*   Handling of edge cases (e.g., impossible scenarios).

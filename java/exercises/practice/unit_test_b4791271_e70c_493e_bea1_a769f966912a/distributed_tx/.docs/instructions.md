## Problem: Distributed Transaction Manager

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager. This manager will coordinate transactions across multiple independent services. Assume these services provide basic ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees *within* themselves but require external coordination for transactions spanning multiple services.

**Scenario:**

Imagine an e-commerce system with several microservices: `InventoryService`, `PaymentService`, `ShippingService`, and `OrderService`.  A customer places an order, which involves:

1.  Reserving items in the `InventoryService`.
2.  Processing the payment through the `PaymentService`.
3.  Creating an order record in the `OrderService`.
4.  Scheduling shipment in the `ShippingService`

All these steps should ideally happen within a single atomic transaction. If any step fails, all previous steps must be rolled back.

**Your Task:**

Implement a `TransactionManager` class that can orchestrate distributed transactions using the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol. The `TransactionManager` should:

1.  **Register Participants:** Allow services (e.g., `InventoryService`, `PaymentService`) to register as participants in a transaction. Each participant must provide two methods: `prepare()` and `commit()`/`rollback()`. The `prepare()` method should tentatively perform its part of the transaction and return a boolean indicating success or failure. The `commit()` method should permanently apply the changes, and the `rollback()` method should undo the changes made by the `prepare()` phase.

2.  **Start Transaction:** Provide a method to start a new transaction.

3.  **Execute Transaction:** Provide a method to execute the transaction. This method should:

    *   Call the `prepare()` method on all registered participants.
    *   If *all* `prepare()` calls succeed, call the `commit()` method on all participants.
    *   If *any* `prepare()` call fails, call the `rollback()` method on all participants.
    *   Handle potential exceptions during `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` calls gracefully, ensuring that all participants are eventually either committed or rolled back.

4.  **Concurrency Handling:**  The `TransactionManager` must be thread-safe. Multiple transactions may be initiated and executed concurrently. Implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

5.  **Idempotency:** Implement measures to handle potential network issues/failures. The `commit()` and `rollback()` operations may be called multiple times. Ensure that they are idempotent â€“ that is, calling them multiple times has the same effect as calling them once.

6.  **Transaction Timeout:** Implement a transaction timeout. If the transaction doesn't complete (either commit or rollback) within a specified time, automatically rollback the transaction.

7.  **Recovery Mechanism:** Consider a simple recovery mechanism. If the `TransactionManager` crashes mid-transaction, it should be able to determine, upon restart, whether to commit or rollback the partially completed transaction.  Assume you can persist minimal transaction metadata to disk (e.g., transaction ID, participants, transaction state) before each phase.

**Constraints:**

*   Use Java concurrency primitives (e.g., `Lock`, `Condition`, `ExecutorService`, `Future`) for thread safety and concurrency.
*   Assume that the network is unreliable and that service calls may fail. Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate.
*   Optimize for throughput. The `TransactionManager` should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent transactions.
*   Assume all service interactions are synchronous.
*   The services themselves are black boxes; you cannot modify them. You can only interact with them through their `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a deadlock detection mechanism. If a transaction is waiting for a resource held by another transaction, and that other transaction is waiting for a resource held by the first transaction, detect this deadlock and break it (e.g., by rolling back one of the transactions).
*   Implement a distributed lock service that the participants can use to acquire locks on resources before participating in a transaction.

This problem tests your understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, exception handling, and fault tolerance. It requires careful consideration of various edge cases and performance optimizations. Good luck!

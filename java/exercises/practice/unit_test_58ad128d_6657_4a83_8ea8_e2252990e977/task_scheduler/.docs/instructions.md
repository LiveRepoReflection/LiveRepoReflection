## Question: Distributed Task Scheduling with Resource Constraints

### Question Description

You are designing a distributed task scheduling system for a large-scale data processing platform. The system needs to schedule independent tasks across a cluster of machines, taking into account resource constraints and network topology.

**System Overview:**

*   **Tasks:** Each task `T` is characterized by:
    *   `taskId`: A unique identifier for the task.
    *   `resourceRequirements`: A map of resource type (e.g., "CPU", "Memory", "Disk") to the amount required (integer).
    *   `dataSize`: The size of the input data required for the task (in bytes).
    *   `priority`: An integer representing the task's priority (higher value means higher priority).
    *   `dependencies`: A set of `taskId`s that must be completed before this task can start.

*   **Machines:** The cluster consists of `N` machines. Each machine `M` is characterized by:
    *   `machineId`: A unique identifier for the machine.
    *   `availableResources`: A map of resource type (e.g., "CPU", "Memory", "Disk") to the amount available (integer).
    *   `location`: A string representing the machine's geographic location (e.g., "US-East", "Europe-West").

*   **Network:** The network between machines is represented by a cost matrix. `networkCost[i][j]` represents the cost (e.g., latency, bandwidth) of transferring data between machine `i` and machine `j`.  If `i == j`, `networkCost[i][j] = 0`. Assume the cost matrix is symmetric (i.e., `networkCost[i][j] == networkCost[j][i]`). Transferring data between machines at different locations has a network transfer cost.

**Scheduling Requirements:**

1.  **Resource Feasibility:** A task can only be scheduled on a machine if the machine has sufficient available resources to meet the task's requirements.

2.  **Dependency Fulfillment:** A task can only start executing after all its dependencies have been completed.

3.  **Data Locality:** If a task requires data that is currently located on a different machine than the one it's scheduled on, the data must be transferred.  The cost of this data transfer is determined by the `dataSize` of the task and the `networkCost` between the machines.

4.  **Priority Scheduling:** Tasks with higher priority should be scheduled before tasks with lower priority.  If two tasks have the same priority, you can break the tie arbitrarily.

5.  **Minimizing Total Cost:** The primary goal is to minimize the total cost of scheduling all tasks. The total cost is the sum of:
    *   Data transfer costs (if data needs to be transferred).
    *   An integer cost for each time unit a task waits before being scheduled. This cost is equal to the task's `priority`.

**Your Task:**

Implement a task scheduler that takes a list of tasks, a list of machines, and the network cost matrix as input, and returns a schedule. The schedule should be represented as a map where the key is the `taskId` and the value is the `machineId` on which the task is scheduled.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of tasks and machines can be large (up to 1000 each).
*   The resource requirements of tasks and the available resources of machines can vary significantly.
*   The network cost matrix can represent a complex network topology.
*   The scheduler must be efficient and return a valid schedule within a reasonable time (e.g., a few seconds).
*   Assume that task execution time is negligible and can be ignored. You are only concerned with minimizing the cost of data transfer and waiting time.
*   Assume that there is a central registry that will handle the task dependency management for you. It can notify you when a task dependency has been fulfilled.

**Input:**

*   `tasks`: A list of task objects.
*   `machines`: A list of machine objects.
*   `networkCost`: A 2D array representing the network cost matrix (N x N, where N is the number of machines).

**Output:**

*   A map where the key is the `taskId` and the value is the `machineId` on which the task is scheduled. If a task cannot be scheduled, it should not be present in the output map.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Not all tasks can be scheduled due to resource constraints.
*   Tasks with circular dependencies (though you can assume this will *not* be in the input data).
*   Machines with very limited resources.
*   High network costs that discourage data transfer.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism to handle task failures and reschedule them.
*   Consider dynamic resource allocation, where machines can acquire or release resources over time.
*   Implement a distributed locking mechanism to prevent race conditions when updating machine resources.

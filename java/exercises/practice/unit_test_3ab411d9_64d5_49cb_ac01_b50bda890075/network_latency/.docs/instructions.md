Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be difficult and complex, incorporating advanced data structures, edge cases, optimization, and real-world considerations.

**Project Name:** `NetworkLatencyOptimization`

**Question Description:**

A large distributed system consists of a network of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a server, and the connections between nodes represent network links. Each network link has an associated latency (a non-negative integer representing the time it takes for a packet to travel across the link).  The network is represented as a directed graph where nodes are uniquely identified by an integer.

Your task is to design a system that can efficiently handle a high volume of real-time latency queries between any two nodes in the network.  The system must not only determine the *minimum* latency path but also be robust to network changes. Links can be added, removed, or their latencies can change dynamically.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **`Network(int nodeCount)`:** Constructor that initializes the network with a specified number of nodes (numbered 0 to `nodeCount - 1`). Initially, there are no links between any nodes.

2.  **`addLink(int source, int destination, int latency)`:**  Adds a directed link from the `source` node to the `destination` node with the given `latency`. If a link already exists between these nodes, update its latency to the new value. Throw `IllegalArgumentException` if `source` or `destination` are out of bounderies or `latency` is negative.

3.  **`removeLink(int source, int destination)`:** Removes the directed link from the `source` node to the `destination` node. If no such link exists, the operation has no effect. Throw `IllegalArgumentException` if `source` or `destination` are out of bounderies.

4.  **`getMinLatency(int source, int destination)`:**  Calculates and returns the minimum latency path (shortest path) between the `source` and `destination` nodes. If no path exists, return `-1`. Throw `IllegalArgumentException` if `source` or `destination` are out of bounderies.

5.  **`getNodesReachableWithinLatency(int source, int maxLatency)`:** Returns a `Set<Integer>` containing all nodes reachable from the `source` node with a total path latency not exceeding `maxLatency`. The set should include the source node itself if `maxLatency` is non-negative.  Nodes should be returned in ascending order. Throw `IllegalArgumentException` if `source` is out of bounderies or `maxLatency` is negative.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Node IDs:** Node IDs are integers ranging from 0 to `nodeCount - 1`.
*   **Latency:** Link latencies are non-negative integers.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of nodes and links (e.g., up to 10,000 nodes and a significantly larger number of links).
*   **Efficiency:** `getMinLatency` and `getNodesReachableWithinLatency` methods must be implemented efficiently. A naive implementation (e.g., recomputing shortest paths from scratch for every query) will likely time out in test cases.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** The system must handle dynamic updates to the network topology (adding and removing links) efficiently, without requiring a full recomputation of all shortest paths after each update.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as disconnected graphs, self-loops (links from a node to itself), and invalid node IDs.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of nodes and links.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a combination of data structures and algorithms to achieve the required performance. Some potentially useful approaches include:
    *   Adjacency lists or adjacency matrices to represent the graph.
    *   Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search for shortest path computation (with appropriate optimizations).
    *   Caching or precomputation of shortest paths to improve query performance.  Consider when to invalidate the cache due to network topology changes.
    *   Heaps (priority queues) for efficient selection of nodes during shortest path search.

*   Pay attention to the complexity of your algorithms for each operation. Aim for solutions with logarithmic or sublinear time complexity where possible.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and system design principles. Good luck!

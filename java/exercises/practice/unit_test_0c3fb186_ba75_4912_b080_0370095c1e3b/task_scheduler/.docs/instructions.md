Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem, designed to be LeetCode Hard difficulty, focusing on efficiency and complex data structures:

**Problem Title:  Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines**

**Problem Description:**

You are given a set of `N` tasks to schedule on a single processor. Each task `i` has the following attributes:

*   `id`: A unique integer identifier for the task (1 to N).
*   `duration`: An integer representing the time required to execute the task.
*   `deadline`: An integer representing the time by which the task must be completed.  If the task is not completed by its deadline, a penalty is incurred.
*   `penalty`: An integer representing the penalty incurred if the task is not completed by its deadline.
*   `dependencies`: A list of task `id`s that must be completed *before* this task can be started. This represents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task dependencies.

Your goal is to find a schedule (an ordered list of task `id`s) that minimizes the total penalty incurred due to missed deadlines.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Valid Schedule:** The schedule must respect all task dependencies. A task cannot be started until all its dependencies are completed.
2.  **Single Processor:** Only one task can be executed at any given time.
3.  **Non-Preemptive:** Once a task is started, it must be completed without interruption.
4.  **Optimization:** You must find a schedule that minimizes the *total* penalty.
5.  **Large Input:** `N` can be up to 10,000.  The `duration`, `deadline`, and `penalty` values can also be large.  Naive solutions (e.g., brute-force) will time out.
6.  **DAG Guarantee:** The input graph of task dependencies is guaranteed to be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This ensures that a valid schedule exists.
7.  **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If multiple schedules achieve the minimum penalty, any one of them is acceptable.
8.  **Zero-Based Indexing:** The returned schedule should be a list (or array) of task `id`s (represented as integers), not indices.
9.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where a task has no dependencies, all tasks have the same deadline, some tasks have very large durations, and some tasks have zero penalties.
10. **Efficiency:** The solution should strive for optimal time complexity. Aim for a solution better than O(N^2).  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms (e.g., topological sort, priority queues, dynamic programming).

**Input:**

A list of `Task` objects, where the `Task` class is defined as:

```java
class Task {
    int id;
    int duration;
    int deadline;
    int penalty;
    List<Integer> dependencies; // List of task IDs that must be completed before this task

    public Task(int id, int duration, int deadline, int penalty, List<Integer> dependencies) {
        this.id = id;
        this.duration = duration;
        this.deadline = deadline;
        this.penalty = penalty;
        this.dependencies = dependencies;
    }
}
```

**Output:**

A `List<Integer>` representing the ordered list of task IDs in the optimal schedule.

**Example:**

```java
List<Task> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
tasks.add(new Task(1, 2, 5, 10, new ArrayList<>()));
tasks.add(new Task(2, 3, 7, 5, Arrays.asList(1)));
tasks.add(new Task(3, 1, 6, 20, Arrays.asList(1)));
tasks.add(new Task(4, 4, 10, 2, Arrays.asList(2, 3)));

// Expected output (one possible optimal schedule): [1, 3, 2, 4]
// This schedule may or may not be optimal, and the optimal schedule
// may vary depending on your solution's logic. The point is to 
// minimize the total penalty.
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, sorting, and potentially some form of dynamic programming or greedy approach to find the optimal schedule within the time constraints. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Java coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator (similar to a two-phase commit protocol) for a system of distributed key-value stores.  Imagine a scenario where multiple independent key-value stores (nodes) exist across a network. A client needs to perform atomic transactions that modify data across these nodes. Atomicity means all changes succeed, or none do.

Your system must guarantee ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for transactions spanning multiple nodes.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:** A client initiates a transaction by sending a request to the coordinator. The request contains a unique transaction ID (UUID) and a list of operations to be performed. Each operation specifies:
    *   The target node (identified by its unique ID, e.g., a URL or IP address).
    *   The key to be modified.
    *   The type of operation (PUT, DELETE).
    *   The value for PUT operations.

2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:** Implement a 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity:

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):** The coordinator sends a "prepare" message to all participating nodes, asking them to tentatively execute the assigned operations. Nodes perform the operations in a temporary staging area, log the changes persistently (simulated or in-memory), and respond with either "ACK" (prepared) or "NACK" (abort). Nodes should handle scenarios where the key might not exist, or other exceptions arise during the operation. If a node sends a "NACK", include a reason code (e.g., "KeyNotFound", "InsufficientResources").

    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Abort Phase):**
        *   If the coordinator receives "ACK" from all participating nodes, it sends a "commit" message to all nodes.  Nodes then permanently apply the changes from their staging area and acknowledge the commit.
        *   If the coordinator receives at least one "NACK" (or a timeout occurs while waiting for responses), it sends an "abort" message to all nodes.  Nodes then discard the changes from their staging area and acknowledge the abort.

3.  **Concurrency Control:** Implement basic concurrency control to prevent conflicting transactions from interfering with each other.  Use a lock (e.g., a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` in Java) at the coordinator level to serialize transaction initiation. For simplicity, you can assume that transactions only conflict if they involve the same keys on the same node.  Nodes do not need to implement their own locking mechanisms.

4.  **Failure Handling:** The system must be resilient to node failures and network issues:

    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for all communication between the coordinator and nodes. If a node doesn't respond within a specified time, consider the transaction as failed and initiate an abort.

    *   **Idempotency:**  Design the system such that commit and abort operations are idempotent.  If a node receives a commit/abort message multiple times (e.g., due to network duplicates), it should apply the operation only once.

    *   **Coordinator Recovery (Optional, but highly encouraged):** Implement a mechanism for the coordinator to recover from a crash.  The coordinator should persist transaction logs (e.g., to a file) to determine the status of in-flight transactions upon restart. After recovery, the coordinator should replay any unfinished commit or abort decisions.

5.  **API:** Implement the following API:

    *   `begin(transactionId)`: Initiates a new transaction.
    *   `put(transactionId, nodeId, key, value)`: Adds a PUT operation to the transaction.
    *   `delete(transactionId, nodeId, key)`: Adds a DELETE operation to the transaction.
    *   `commit(transactionId)`: Attempts to commit the transaction.  Returns `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.
    *   `abort(transactionId)`: Aborts the transaction.
    *   `registerNode(nodeId, nodeAddress)`: Registers a node with the coordinator.

6.  **Optimization Considerations:**

    *   **Asynchronous Communication:** Use asynchronous communication (e.g., using Java's `CompletableFuture`) to improve performance. The coordinator should not block while waiting for responses from nodes.

    *   **Batching (Optional):** Consider batching multiple operations destined for the same node into a single message to reduce network overhead.

**Constraints:**

*   Nodes are assumed to be unreliable and can fail at any time.
*   Network communication can be unreliable, with messages potentially being lost or duplicated.
*   The number of nodes and the size of the key-value stores can be large.
*   Minimize the latency of successful commits.
*   Assume that node IDs are unique.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness (ACID properties are guaranteed).
*   Robustness (Handles node failures, network issues, and timeouts).
*   Performance (Latency of commits, throughput of transactions).
*   Code quality (Readability, maintainability, adherence to best practices).
*   Completeness (Implementation of all required features).
*   Coordinator Recovery (bonus).

This problem is designed to be very challenging, requiring a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency control, failure handling, and performance optimization. It also allows for multiple valid approaches, each with its own trade-offs.  Good luck!

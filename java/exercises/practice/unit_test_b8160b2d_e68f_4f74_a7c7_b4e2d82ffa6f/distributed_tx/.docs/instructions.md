## Problem: Distributed Transaction Manager

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture. The system involves multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) and needs to ensure atomicity across operations performed on these services. This means that a transaction should either commit successfully across all participating services, or roll back completely, leaving no partial updates.

**Scenario:**

Imagine an e-commerce platform where a user places an order. This order involves several microservices:

1.  **Order Service:** Creates a new order record.
2.  **Inventory Service:** Decreases the quantity of ordered items.
3.  **Payment Service:** Processes the user's payment.
4.  **Shipping Service:** Schedules the shipment.

A successful order transaction requires all four services to complete their respective operations. If any service fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Coordination:** Implement a central DTM that can initiate, coordinate, and finalize distributed transactions. The DTM should use the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol (or any other distributed transaction protocol) to manage the transaction lifecycle.

2.  **Service Registration:** Services must be able to register with the DTM to participate in transactions. When registering, services should provide:
    *   A unique service identifier.
    *   Endpoints for the DTM to invoke the `prepare` and `commit/rollback` operations. These operations may be simulated for ease of implementation.

3.  **Transaction Initiation:** The DTM should provide an API to initiate a new transaction. This API should accept a list of participating service identifiers.

4.  **Prepare Phase:** When a transaction starts, the DTM should invoke the `prepare` operation on each participating service. Each service should attempt to perform its operation and indicate success (ready to commit) or failure (abort) to the DTM. The `prepare` operation should be idempotent, meaning it can be called multiple times without changing the outcome.

5.  **Commit/Rollback Phase:**
    *   If all services successfully prepare, the DTM should invoke the `commit` operation on each service.
    *   If any service fails to prepare, the DTM should invoke the `rollback` operation on all services.
    *   The `commit` and `rollback` operations should also be idempotent and handle potential network failures gracefully.

6.  **Concurrency and Scalability:** The DTM should be designed to handle concurrent transactions efficiently. Explore approaches to minimize locking and maximize throughput.  Consider how the DTM could be scaled horizontally to support a large number of transactions and services.

7.  **Failure Handling:** The DTM must be resilient to failures. It should be able to recover from crashes and continue coordinating transactions. Consider how the DTM state (transaction status, participant information) is persisted to ensure durability.

8.  **Optimizations:**
    *   Implement an optimization to improve performance. Examples include:
        *   **Read-only optimization:** If a service is read-only, skip the prepare phase.
        *   **Last agent optimization:** Elect a last agent to perform the commit.
        *   **Parallel Prepare:** Invoke prepare operations on services concurrently.

9.  **Edge Cases:** Handle the following edge cases:
    *   Service unavailable during prepare, commit, or rollback.
    *   DTM crashes during transaction coordination.
    *   Network partitions.

**Constraints:**

*   **Language:** Java
*   **External Libraries:** Minimize the use of external libraries, but you can use libraries for networking, concurrency, and persistence (e.g., a simple file-based persistence). Avoid full-fledged distributed transaction frameworks (like JTA).
*   **Performance:** Aim for a design that minimizes latency and maximizes throughput.
*   **Scalability:** Consider the scalability implications of your design. How would your DTM handle a large number of services and transactions?

**Deliverables:**

1.  Well-documented Java code implementing the DTM and a sample service.
2.  A design document outlining the architecture, data structures, algorithms, and failure handling mechanisms.
3.  A discussion of the trade-offs made in your design, particularly regarding performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
4.  Demonstrate your DTM working with at least 3 simulated services.

This problem emphasizes a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, transaction management, concurrency, and failure handling. It requires careful design and implementation to meet the stringent requirements. Good luck!

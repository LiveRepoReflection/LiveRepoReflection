## Question: Distributed Transaction Manager

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture. The DTM must ensure the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across multiple services participating in a single transaction.

Imagine a scenario where a user wants to transfer funds from their account in `Service A` to another user's account in `Service B`. Both services have their own independent databases. To ensure the transfer happens correctly, either both services must successfully update their databases, or neither should. This requires a distributed transaction.

Your DTM will operate using the 2-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.  The coordinator (your DTM) orchestrates the transaction across the participants (the microservices).

**Specifically, you must implement the following functionality:**

1.  **Transaction Coordination:** The DTM receives a request to initiate a distributed transaction involving `Service A` and `Service B`. The request specifies the operation to be performed on each service (e.g., debit from account X in Service A, credit to account Y in Service B), including the account IDs and the amount to transfer.

2.  **Prepare Phase:** The DTM sends a "prepare" message to each participating service, asking if it can perform the operation. Each service must respond with either a "commit" (meaning it's ready to commit the changes) or an "abort" (meaning it cannot commit the changes, e.g., due to insufficient funds, database errors, etc.). The service should *tentatively* perform the requested operation in this phase, logging its actions in a way that allows it to either commit or rollback the changes later.

3.  **Commit/Abort Phase:**

    *   If *all* services respond with "commit" in the prepare phase, the DTM sends a "commit" message to all services.  Upon receiving the "commit" message, each service must permanently apply the changes it tentatively made in the prepare phase.
    *   If *any* service responds with "abort" in the prepare phase, the DTM sends an "abort" message to all services. Upon receiving the "abort" message, each service must rollback any changes it tentatively made in the prepare phase.

4.  **Failure Handling:** The DTM and the services must handle failures gracefully. This includes:

    *   **Service Failure during Prepare:**  If a service fails to respond to the "prepare" message within a reasonable timeout, the DTM must treat it as an "abort" and initiate the rollback process.
    *   **DTM Failure:** If the DTM fails after sending "prepare" messages but before sending "commit" or "abort" messages, upon recovery, the DTM must query the status of each participant and proceed accordingly (commit if all prepared, abort if any aborted or did not prepare).
    *   **Service Failure during Commit/Abort:** If a service fails after receiving a "commit" or "abort" message but before permanently applying or rolling back the changes, upon recovery, the service must consult a persistent log to determine the final outcome of the transaction (commit or abort) and apply it accordingly.

5.  **Concurrency:**  The DTM must handle concurrent transaction requests correctly.  Transactions should be isolated from each other (ideally using snapshot isolation at the service level, though you are not required to implement the snapshot isolation logic in this problem).

### Constraints and Requirements:

*   **Languages:** Java
*   **Data Structure:** You can use any appropriate data structures. Be prepared to justify your choices. Focus on efficient data structures.
*   **Persistence:**  You *must* implement a durable log for *both* the DTM and the services. This log should be used for recovery after failures. Consider using a simple file-based log, but justify your choice if you use something else. The log should be append-only.
*   **Communication:**  You can simulate communication between the DTM and the services using in-memory method calls. Real-world systems would use network communication (e.g., gRPC, REST), but for this problem, keep it simple.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling.  Log all errors and ensure that the system recovers gracefully from failures.
*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement a fully scalable system, consider the design choices that would impact scalability in a real-world implementation.  Comment on these trade-offs in your code.
*   **Timeout:** Implement appropriate timeouts for all operations (e.g., prepare phase, commit phase).
*   **Deadlock:** Consider the possibility of deadlocks (e.g., two transactions trying to access the same resources in different orders). Although you don't have to *solve* the deadlock problem, you should *detect* it and log a warning.
*   **Optimization:**  Optimize for minimizing the time a transaction takes to complete.

### Evaluation Criteria:

*   **Correctness:**  Does the DTM correctly ensure ACID properties across multiple services?
*   **Robustness:** Does the system handle failures gracefully and recover correctly?
*   **Concurrency:** Does the system handle concurrent transactions correctly and provide isolation?
*   **Design:** Is the design well-structured, modular, and maintainable?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the implementation efficient in terms of resource usage and transaction latency?
*   **Documentation:** Is the code well-documented and easy to understand?
*   **Justification:** Are the design choices (data structures, algorithms, persistence strategy) justified?

This is a challenging problem that requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, transaction management, and Java programming. Good luck!

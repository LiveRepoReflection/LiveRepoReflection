Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be complex and require careful consideration of efficiency and data structures.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Manager**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a system where multiple services need to participate in a single, atomic transaction. If one service fails to commit its changes, the entire transaction must be rolled back across all participating services.

Your DTM will manage the transaction lifecycle using the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.  You will simulate the participating services with simple data stores in memory.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction ID Generation:**  The DTM must generate unique transaction IDs for each new transaction.

2.  **Service Registration:**  Services can register with the DTM, providing a unique service ID and a callback interface (simulated with an abstract class/interface) for the `prepare` and `commit/rollback` phases. The callback will receive a transaction ID and data to be prepared/committed/rolled back.

3.  **Transaction Initiation:**  A client can initiate a distributed transaction by providing a list of participating service IDs and data to be processed by each service.

4.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Implementation:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):**  The DTM sends a `prepare` request (via the callback) to each participating service, along with the transaction ID and the data for that service. The service must attempt to prepare the transaction (e.g., write the data to a temporary location).  The service returns a boolean indicating success (`true`) or failure (`false`).
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):**
        *   If all services successfully prepare, the DTM sends a `commit` request (via the callback) to each service. The service then finalizes the transaction (e.g., moves the data from the temporary location to its final destination).
        *   If any service fails to prepare, the DTM sends a `rollback` request (via the callback) to all services. The service then undoes any changes made during the prepare phase.

5.  **Concurrency Handling:**  The DTM must handle concurrent transactions gracefully.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores) to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

6.  **Failure Handling:**
    *   **Service Failure:**  If a service fails to respond to a `prepare` or `commit/rollback` request (simulate this with a timeout), the DTM should attempt to retry the request a limited number of times. If the service remains unavailable, the DTM should roll back the transaction for all other participating services.
    *   **DTM Failure:**  Consider how the system would recover if the DTM itself fails mid-transaction. (You don't need to implement full crash recovery, but document your design considerations for handling DTM failures).

7.  **Optimization:**  Minimize the latency of the transaction process. Consider using asynchronous communication where appropriate.

8.  **Data Store Simulation:**  Instead of connecting to actual databases, simulate each service's data store with an in-memory data structure (e.g., a `HashMap`).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of participating services in a single transaction can vary.
*   The data being passed to each service can be of any type (use generics).
*   Implement a reasonable timeout mechanism for service responses.
*   Minimize blocking operations.
*   Provide a clear and concise API for clients to initiate transactions.

**Example Usage Scenario:**

Imagine a scenario where transferring money between bank accounts requires updates to both the source and destination accounts. Each bank account is managed by a separate microservice. A distributed transaction would ensure that either both accounts are updated (money is transferred), or neither account is updated (the transfer fails).

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the DTM correctly implement the 2PC protocol and handle all edge cases?
*   Concurrency: Does the DTM handle concurrent transactions safely and efficiently?
*   Failure Handling: Does the DTM gracefully handle service failures?
*   Performance: Is the DTM optimized for low latency?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Design Considerations: How well does the design address potential DTM failures and scalability issues?

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and exception handling. Good luck!

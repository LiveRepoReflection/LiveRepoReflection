Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem description.

## Project Name

`OptimalNetworkPlacement`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing an algorithm to determine the optimal placement of a given number of network nodes within a pre-existing infrastructure. The goal is to minimize the average latency experienced by users accessing a set of services.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're a network architect for a large cloud provider. You have a network represented as an undirected graph. The nodes in the graph represent physical locations (data centers, edge servers) and the edges represent network connections between them. Each edge has a weight representing the latency of communication between the connected locations.

You need to deploy `K` new network nodes within this existing infrastructure. These new nodes will host critical services that many users across the network need to access. Your objective is to find the `K` locations in the graph to place these nodes such that the average latency from each existing node (representing a user) to its nearest service node is minimized.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: An adjacency list representing the network graph. The keys of the adjacency list are node IDs (integers), and the values are lists of `Edge` objects. An `Edge` object contains the destination node ID and the latency (a double) of the connection.

```java
class Edge {
    int destination;
    double latency;

    public Edge(int destination, double latency) {
        this.destination = destination;
        this.latency = latency;
    }
}

Map<Integer, List<Edge>> graph;
```

*   `numExistingNodes`: The number of existing nodes representing users. These nodes are numbered from `0` to `numExistingNodes - 1`.

*   `K`: The number of new network nodes to place.

**Output:**

*   A `List<Integer>` containing the node IDs of the `K` locations where the new network nodes should be placed to minimize the average latency.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (up to 10,000 nodes).
*   The number of new nodes `K` can be relatively small (e.g., 1 to 10) compared to the graph size.
*   Latency values are positive doubles.
*   You must place the `K` new nodes at *existing* nodes in the graph; you cannot create new locations.
*   Your solution must be efficient enough to handle large graphs within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Correctness:** Does your algorithm correctly find a set of `K` nodes that minimizes the average latency?
2.  **Efficiency:** How efficiently does your algorithm run, especially with large graphs? Solutions with significantly better time complexity will be prioritized.
3.  **Optimization:** How close is your solution to the absolute optimal placement?  Finding the true global optimum might be computationally infeasible, so a good approximation is acceptable.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a graph with 5 nodes, `numExistingNodes = 5`, and you need to place `K = 1` new node.  The optimal location would be the node that, on average, is closest to all other nodes.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall) to calculate distances between nodes.
*   Think about how to efficiently iterate through possible combinations of `K` nodes.  Brute-force is unlikely to be efficient enough for large graphs.
*   Explore approximation algorithms or heuristics to find a near-optimal solution within the time constraints.  Consider greedy approaches.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases and handle them gracefully (e.g., disconnected graphs).

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of efficiency. Good luck!

`DistributedRateLimiter`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter. This rate limiter needs to handle a high volume of requests across multiple servers, ensuring that no single user or service exceeds a predefined request limit within a given time window.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a popular online service with millions of users. To protect your infrastructure from abuse, denial-of-service attacks, and unintentional overload, you need to implement a rate limiter. This rate limiter should be distributed across multiple servers in your cluster, providing a consistent and reliable way to control the rate at which users (identified by a unique user ID) or services (identified by a unique service ID) can make requests.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Rate Limiting Rules:** The rate limiter must support configurable rate limiting rules. Each rule specifies:
    *   A unique identifier for the rule.
    *   The target (either a specific user ID or a service ID, or a wildcard to apply to all).
    *   The request limit (maximum number of requests allowed).
    *   The time window (in seconds) during which the request limit applies.

2.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must function correctly across multiple servers. This means that if a user makes requests that are handled by different servers, the rate limiter should still accurately track and enforce the rate limits.

3.  **Consistency:** The rate limiter should provide strong consistency. If a request is allowed by the rate limiter on one server, subsequent requests from the same user within a short time frame should also be consistently allowed (unless the rate limit is exceeded).

4.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter must be highly efficient, capable of handling a high volume of requests with minimal latency. Optimize for read (checking if a request should be allowed) operations.

5.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple users and services.

6.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter architecture should be scalable to accommodate increasing traffic and the addition of more servers to the cluster.

7.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be resilient to failures. If one server fails, the rate limiter should continue to function correctly on the remaining servers.

8.  **Dynamic Rule Updates:** The rate limiter must support dynamic updates to the rate limiting rules. You should be able to add, modify, or remove rules without requiring a restart of the rate limiter service.

9. **Granularity**: The rate limiter should be able to handle different levels of granularity. For example, it should be able to limit requests per user, per service, or globally (across all users and services).

10. **Atomic increment:** The system must increment the counter for each request atomically.

**Implementation Details:**

You are free to choose the underlying data structures and algorithms for your rate limiter. However, consider the following:

*   A distributed cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached) can be used to store the request counts and timestamps.
*   Consider using a combination of data structures for optimal performance, e.g., a sliding window with a sorted set or a fixed window with a counter.
*   Explore different strategies for handling race conditions and ensuring atomicity.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of users and services can be very large (millions or billions).
*   The time window for rate limiting can vary from seconds to hours.
*   The request rate can be very high (thousands or millions of requests per second).
*   Minimize memory footprint per user/service.

**Your Task:**

Implement the `DistributedRateLimiter` class with the following methods:

*   `DistributedRateLimiter(configuration)`: Constructor. Takes a configuration object that specifies the connection details for the distributed cache and other relevant parameters.
*   `add_rule(rule_id, target, limit, window)`: Adds a new rate limiting rule.
*   `update_rule(rule_id, limit, window)`: Updates an existing rate limiting rule.
*   `remove_rule(rule_id)`: Removes a rate limiting rule.
*   `is_allowed(target_id, rule_id)`: Checks if a request from the given `target_id` (user ID or service ID) is allowed based on the specified `rule_id`.  This method should return `true` if the request is allowed and `false` otherwise. Importantly, this function *must* atomically update the request count in the cache if the request is allowed.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to automatically expire old request counts from the cache to reduce memory usage.
*   Add metrics and monitoring to track the performance of the rate limiter (e.g., request rate, latency, error rate).
*   Provide a simple API for managing and monitoring the rate limiter.
*   Consider the scenario of multiple rules applying to the same target and implement a prioritization mechanism.

This problem is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, caching, and algorithm design. Good luck!

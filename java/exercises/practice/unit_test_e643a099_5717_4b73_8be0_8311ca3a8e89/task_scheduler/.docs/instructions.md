Okay, here is a challenging Java coding problem designed with the considerations you've requested.

## Problem Title:  Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

### Problem Description

You are given a set of tasks to execute. Each task has the following attributes:

*   **`id`**: A unique integer identifier for the task.
*   **`duration`**: An integer representing the time (in arbitrary units) required to complete the task.
*   **`deadline`**: An integer representing the time by which the task must be completed. A deadline of `X` means the task must be completed *on or before* time `X`.
*   **`dependencies`**: A list of task `id`s that must be completed before this task can start.  A task cannot begin execution until *all* of its dependencies are finished.

Your goal is to determine the **minimum total lateness** achievable by scheduling these tasks.  Lateness of a task is defined as `max(0, completionTime - deadline)`. The total lateness is the sum of the lateness of all tasks.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as a list of tasks. Each task will be represented by its `id`, `duration`, `deadline`, and `dependencies`.

**Output:**

Your program should return a single integer representing the minimum total lateness achievable by scheduling all tasks. If it's impossible to complete all tasks before their deadlines due to dependencies or time constraints, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= Number of tasks <= 1000`
*   `1 <= duration <= 1000`
*   `1 <= deadline <= 10000`
*   Task `id`s are unique and within the range `[1, Number of tasks]`.
*   Dependencies are valid task `id`s.  A task cannot depend on itself, and there are no circular dependencies. However, the dependency graph might not be a single, connected component.
*   The dependency graph can be dense, with tasks having many dependencies.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should aim for optimal time complexity. Naive brute-force approaches will likely time out.  Consider using dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and/or heuristics to optimize your solution.
*   Minimize memory usage where possible.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   Tasks with no dependencies.
*   Tasks with very tight deadlines.
*   Dependency chains that severely limit scheduling options.
*   Disjoint sets of tasks (tasks that don't depend on each other).
*   Input data might be malformed (e.g., invalid task IDs in dependencies). Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., throw an exception or return an error code). For the sake of simplicity, you can assume the input data is always valid for the purpose of calculating total lateness, but you should still check for potential errors that could lead to incorrect results.
*   Some tasks might have the same deadline.

**Example:**

Let's say you have the following tasks:

*   Task 1: `duration = 2, deadline = 5, dependencies = []`
*   Task 2: `duration = 3, deadline = 7, dependencies = [1]`
*   Task 3: `duration = 1, deadline = 6, dependencies = [2]`

One possible schedule is:

1.  Task 1 (starts at 0, finishes at 2)
2.  Task 2 (starts at 2, finishes at 5)
3.  Task 3 (starts at 5, finishes at 6)

Lateness:

*   Task 1: `max(0, 2 - 5) = 0`
*   Task 2: `max(0, 5 - 7) = 0`
*   Task 3: `max(0, 6 - 6) = 0`

Total lateness: 0

Another possible schedule is:

1. Task 1 (starts at 0, finishes at 2)
2. Task 3 (starts at 2, finishes at 3)
3. Task 2 (starts at 3, finishes at 6)

Lateness:

*   Task 1: `max(0, 2 - 5) = 0`
*   Task 2: `max(0, 6 - 7) = 0`
*   Task 3: `max(0, 3 - 6) = 0`

Total lateness: 0

**Clarifications:**

*   You can assume that tasks can be executed sequentially (one task at a time).
*   Preemption is not allowed (once a task starts, it must run to completion).
*   The tasks must all be completed if possible to do so.

This problem requires careful consideration of task dependencies, deadlines, and optimization techniques to find the schedule that minimizes total lateness. Good luck!

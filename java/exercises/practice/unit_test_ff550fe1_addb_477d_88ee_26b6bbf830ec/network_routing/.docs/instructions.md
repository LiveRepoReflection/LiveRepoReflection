## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing system for a large-scale Content Delivery Network (CDN). The CDN consists of a network of interconnected servers (nodes) distributed geographically. When a user requests content, the CDN needs to determine the best server to serve the content from, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

The network topology is represented as a weighted, undirected graph. Each node represents a server, and each edge represents a network connection between two servers. The weight of an edge represents the latency (in milliseconds) of the connection.

Given a set of content requests, your task is to design an algorithm and implement a system that efficiently routes each request to the best available server.

**Input:**

1.  **Network Topology:** A list of edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(server1, server2, latency)`. `server1` and `server2` are unique integer identifiers for the servers, and `latency` is a positive integer representing the latency of the connection.
2.  **Server Capacities:** A map of server identifiers to their current processing capacity (number of requests that can be handled concurrently).
3.  **Content Requests:** A list of content requests, where each request is represented as a tuple `(user_location, content_id)`. `user_location` is a server identifier representing the user's closest server, and `content_id` is a string representing the unique identifier of the content being requested.
4.  **Content Location:** A map of content identifiers to a list of server identifiers which holds a cached copy of the content.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of servers can be very large (up to 10,000).
*   The number of edges can be very large (up to 50,000).
*   The number of content requests can be very large (up to 100,000).
*   Server capacities can change dynamically.
*   Latency values can vary significantly.
*   Minimize average latency for all content requests.
*   Distribute the load evenly across the servers.
*   The same content might be located on multiple servers.
*   If no server has the content, the request fails and should be recorded as dropped.

**Output:**

A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the routing decision for a content request. Each tuple should be in the format `(request_id, server_id, status)`. `request_id` is the index of the content request in the input list, `server_id` is the identifier of the server to which the request is routed, and `status` is a string indicating whether the request was successfully served (`"served"`) or dropped (`"dropped"`).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Minimize Average Latency:** The primary goal is to minimize the average latency experienced by users.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute the content requests across servers to prevent overloading any single server.
*   **Dynamic Server Capacities:** The routing algorithm must be able to adapt to changes in server capacities. This could be simulated by periodically updating the server capacities between batches of requests.
*   **Scalability:** The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle a large number of servers and content requests.

**Considerations:**

*   You can use any standard graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm) or heuristics.
*   Consider using caching strategies to improve performance.
*   Think about how to handle edge cases, such as disconnected servers or content not being available on any server.
*   Discuss the trade-offs between different approaches in terms of latency, load balancing, and scalability.
*   How would you handle a scenario where the content location data becomes stale?
*   How would you handle a scenario where a server fails mid-processing?
*   How would you incorporate real-time network congestion data into your routing decisions?

This problem requires careful consideration of algorithm design, data structure selection, and optimization techniques. The solution should be efficient, scalable, and robust to handle the constraints and edge cases described above. Good luck!

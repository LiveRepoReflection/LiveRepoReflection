## Question: Distributed Transaction Manager

### Description:

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a microservices architecture.  Imagine a system where multiple independent services need to update their databases as part of a single, atomic operation. If *any* of the services fail to update successfully, *all* of the updates must be rolled back, ensuring data consistency across the entire system.

Your DTM will coordinate transactions across these services using the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Coordination:** Your DTM must be able to initiate and manage distributed transactions. It needs to track which services are participating in a given transaction.

2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Implementation:**  Implement the 2PC protocol. This involves a "prepare" phase where the DTM asks all participating services if they *can* commit, and a "commit" or "rollback" phase based on the responses received.

3.  **Service Interaction:** Your DTM must interact with external services via a simple, well-defined API. Assume each service exposes two endpoints:
    *   `/prepare/{transactionId}`:  The DTM calls this to ask the service to prepare for the commit.  The service should attempt to perform the required update but *not* commit it permanently. It should respond with `200 OK` if it successfully prepared or a `500 Internal Server Error` if it failed.  The service *must* hold any locks or resources until the DTM tells it to commit or rollback.
    *   `/commit/{transactionId}`: The DTM calls this to tell the service to permanently commit the update. The service should commit the changes and release any held resources. It should respond with `200 OK` if successful or a `500 Internal Server Error` if it failed.
    *   `/rollback/{transactionId}`: The DTM calls this to tell the service to rollback the update. The service should revert any changes and release any held resources. It should respond with `200 OK` if successful or a `500 Internal Server Error` if it failed.

4.  **Concurrency and Thread Safety:** The DTM must be able to handle multiple concurrent transaction requests. Ensure your implementation is thread-safe.

5.  **Failure Handling:** The DTM must be resilient to failures. Consider the following scenarios:
    *   A service fails to respond during the prepare phase.
    *   A service fails to respond during the commit or rollback phase.
    *   The DTM itself crashes and restarts.
    *   Network partitions or delays prevent timely communication.

    You need to implement appropriate retry mechanisms, timeouts, and logging to handle these failures gracefully.  If a service fails to respond, the DTM must attempt to retry a reasonable number of times before giving up.  The number of retries and timeouts should be configurable.  If the DTM crashes, it needs to be able to recover its state and resume ongoing transactions.

6.  **Transaction Logging and Recovery:** Implement transaction logging to disk. The log should contain sufficient information to reconstruct the state of ongoing transactions in case of DTM failure. On startup, the DTM should read the log and recover any incomplete transactions. Consider scenarios where a service might have committed, but the DTM failed before recording this in its log.

7.  **Optimistic Concurrency Control:**  Assume that the individual services use optimistic concurrency control (e.g., versioning) to detect and handle conflicts during the prepare phase. The prepare call to a service can fail if the data it expected to update has been modified by another transaction in the meantime.

8. **Deadlock Prevention:** Assume each service can potentially have deadlocks internally or externally. The DTM should have a mechanism to timeout in case of global deadlock.

**Input:**

The DTM will receive transaction requests as a list of service URLs that need to participate in the transaction. For example:

```
[
  "http://service1.example.com",
  "http://service2.example.com",
  "http://service3.example.com"
]
```

**Output:**

The DTM should return a success/failure indication for each transaction.  It should also provide detailed logs of its operations, including the outcome of each 2PC phase for each service.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement a fully distributed DTM, consider the design implications for scaling up the system to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and participating services.  Document any bottlenecks or limitations in your design.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for performance.  The 2PC protocol inherently involves multiple network calls, so minimize latency where possible.  Consider techniques like asynchronous communication and parallel processing of service responses.
*   **Idempotency:** Ensure that all service interactions are idempotent.  The DTM might need to retry commit or rollback operations multiple times, so services must be able to handle duplicate requests without adverse effects.
*   **Configuration:** The retry count, timeouts, and log file location should be configurable.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and fault tolerance. It's a complex problem, but a solid implementation of the core requirements will be highly valuable. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java problem designed to test a wide range of skills, suitable for a high-level programming competition.

**Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator.  In a distributed system, transactions might span multiple services.  To ensure data consistency, we need a mechanism to either commit all operations across the services involved in a transaction, or roll back all operations if any part of the transaction fails.

Your system must manage a set of distributed transactions. Each transaction involves a set of participating services. Each service participating in a transaction can either successfully perform its part of the transaction or fail.

**Core Functionality:**

1.  **Transaction Initiation:**  A client initiates a new transaction with a unique transaction ID. The client specifies the participating services for this transaction.

2.  **Service Registration:** Each service must register itself with the coordinator, providing a unique service ID and a callback mechanism (e.g., a URL or method reference) that the coordinator can use to trigger commit or rollback operations.

3.  **Prepare Phase:**  Once a transaction is initiated, the coordinator sends a "prepare" message to each participating service.  Each service attempts to perform its part of the transaction and responds to the coordinator with either a "prepared" (success) or "abort" (failure) message.  The prepare phase must be idempotent. A service might receive the prepare message multiple times, and it must only perform the preparation once.

4.  **Commit/Rollback Phase:**
    *   If all services respond with "prepared," the coordinator sends a "commit" message to each service. Each service then permanently commits its changes.
    *   If any service responds with "abort," or if the coordinator times out waiting for a response from any service, the coordinator sends a "rollback" message to each service. Each service then undoes any changes made during the prepare phase.
    *   The commit/rollback phase must also be idempotent. A service might receive the commit/rollback message multiple times.

5.  **Transaction Completion:** After all participating services have successfully committed or rolled back, the transaction is considered complete. The coordinator should maintain a log of completed transactions and their outcome (committed or rolled back).

6. **Concurrency:** Multiple transactions may be happening in parallel, your coordinator must handle concurrent transactions correctly and efficiently.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:**  Your coordinator should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and services. Consider how data is stored and accessed. Aim for good performance characteristics.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The coordinator itself might crash.  Design your system so that it can recover from a crash without losing transaction state. This will require persistence of transaction metadata.
*   **Idempotency:**  As mentioned above, the prepare, commit, and rollback operations at the service level *must* be idempotent.
*   **Timeout:** The coordinator must implement a timeout mechanism. If a service does not respond to a "prepare" message within a specified time, the coordinator should treat the service as having failed and initiate a rollback.
*   **Service Unavailability:**  Services might become unavailable (e.g., due to network issues). The coordinator should handle service unavailability gracefully, potentially retrying operations or marking the transaction for rollback if a service remains unavailable for an extended period.
*   **Logging:**  Maintain a persistent log of all transaction events (initiation, prepare messages sent, responses received, commit/rollback decisions, completion). This log should be designed for efficient querying and analysis.
*   **Resource Management:** The coordinator should efficiently manage resources (e.g., threads, memory) to avoid resource exhaustion under high load.

**Specific Instructions:**

*   Implement the core transaction coordinator logic in Java.
*   Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to meet the performance and scalability requirements.
*   Consider using a persistent storage mechanism (e.g., a relational database, NoSQL database, or file system) to store transaction metadata and logs.
*   Implement proper error handling and logging.
*   Design your code to be modular and testable.
*   Provide clear documentation of your design choices and implementation details.
*   Minimize any external library dependancies outside the java standard library if at all possible.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness:  Does the coordinator correctly handle all transaction scenarios, including successful commits, rollbacks, timeouts, and service unavailability?
*   Scalability:  How well does the coordinator scale to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and services?
*   Fault Tolerance:  Can the coordinator recover from crashes without losing transaction state?
*   Performance:  What is the throughput and latency of the coordinator under different load conditions?
*   Code Quality:  Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Design:  Is the design of the coordinator well-thought-out and appropriate for the requirements?
*   Completeness:  Does the implementation address all the specified constraints and requirements?
*   Efficiency: How well does the code use system resources.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems principles, concurrency, data structures, algorithms, and Java programming. It rewards a well-designed, efficient, and robust solution. Good luck!

## Question: Optimized Distributed Task Scheduling

### Question Description

You are building a distributed system for processing a large number of independent tasks. Each task has a specific execution time and a deadline. The system consists of `N` worker nodes, each with limited processing capacity. Your goal is to schedule the tasks across the worker nodes to minimize the *maximum lateness* of any task.

**Task Definition:**

Each task `i` is represented by a tuple: `(execution_time_i, deadline_i)`.

*   `execution_time_i`: The time required to execute the task on any worker node.
*   `deadline_i`: The time by which the task must be completed.

**Worker Node Definition:**

You have `N` identical worker nodes. Each node can execute only one task at a time.

**Scheduling Constraints:**

1.  A task must be assigned to exactly one worker node.
2.  A worker node can only execute one task at a time.
3.  A task cannot be preempted (once started, it must run to completion).
4.  The tasks assigned to a worker node are executed in the order they are scheduled.

**Lateness Definition:**

The lateness of a task `i` is defined as: `lateness_i = completion_time_i - deadline_i`. If `completion_time_i` is less than `deadline_i`, then `lateness_i` is negative.

**Objective:**

Minimize the maximum lateness across all tasks. The maximum lateness is defined as: `max_lateness = max(lateness_1, lateness_2, ..., lateness_M)`, where `M` is the total number of tasks.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of worker nodes (an integer).
*   `tasks`: A list of task tuples `[(execution_time_1, deadline_1), (execution_time_2, deadline_2), ..., (execution_time_M, deadline_M)]`.

**Output:**

An integer representing the minimum possible maximum lateness achievable by scheduling the tasks across the worker nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 10`
*   `1 <= M <= 1000` (number of tasks)
*   `1 <= execution_time_i <= 100`
*   `1 <= deadline_i <= 10000`

**Optimization Requirements:**

Your solution should be highly optimized for time complexity. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out. Consider using efficient data structures and algorithms to explore the solution space.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**

*   Tasks with very tight deadlines might force some lateness.
*   The order in which tasks are assigned to workers significantly impacts the maximum lateness.
*   Consider sorting the tasks based on some criteria to improve scheduling efficiency.
*   The number of tasks can be significantly larger than the number of worker nodes, making optimal allocation challenging.
*   Be mindful of integer overflow if calculating completion times.

**Example:**

```
N = 2
tasks = [(50, 100), (30, 150), (20, 60), (40, 80)]

Possible Schedule (not necessarily optimal):

Worker 1: (20, 60) -> Completion Time: 20, Lateness: -40
          (50, 100) -> Completion Time: 70, Lateness: -30

Worker 2: (40, 80) -> Completion Time: 40, Lateness: -40
          (30, 150) -> Completion Time: 70, Lateness: -80

Max Lateness = max(-40, -30, -40, -80) = -30

```

**Challenge:**

Develop an efficient algorithm to find the schedule that minimizes the maximum lateness. Aim for a solution that can handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes within the given constraints. Your solution will be judged based on its correctness, efficiency, and ability to handle edge cases.

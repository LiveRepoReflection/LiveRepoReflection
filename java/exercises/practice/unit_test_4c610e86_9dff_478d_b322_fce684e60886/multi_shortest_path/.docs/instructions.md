Okay, here's a hard-level coding problem for a programming competition, designed to be challenging and sophisticated, incorporating several elements you requested.

**Project Name:** `Multi-SourceShortestPath`

**Question Description:**

You are given a directed graph represented as an adjacency list.  Each node in the graph represents a city, and each directed edge represents a one-way road between cities. Each road has an associated cost (a positive integer) representing the time it takes to travel that road.

Additionally, you are given a list of *K* "source cities". Your task is to find, for *every* city in the graph, the minimum cost to reach that city from *any* of the *K* source cities.

**Specifics:**

*   **Input:**
    *   `n`: An integer representing the number of cities (nodes in the graph), numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
    *   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, cost)` represents a directed edge from city `u` to city `v` with a cost of `cost`.
    *   `sources`: A list of integers representing the *K* source cities.
*   **Output:**
    *   A list of integers, where the *i*-th element represents the minimum cost to reach city *i* from any of the *K* source cities. If a city is unreachable from any of the source cities, the corresponding element should be `-1`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= K <= n`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= cost <= 10^4`
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   The graph may be disconnected.
*   A city can be a source city multiple times.
*   Your solution should be optimized for time complexity. Naive approaches will likely time out.
*   Consider the case when the graph is very large and sparse.
*   Consider potential integer overflow issues when calculating costs.
*   There may be multiple edges between two cities.
*   The number of edges will be such that any reasonable graph can be represented.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 3), (1, 3, 6), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 4), (4, 1, 1)]
sources = [0, 4]

Output:
[0, 5, 3, 5, 4]
```

**Explanation:**

*   City 0 is a source, so the cost to reach it is 0.
*   City 1 can be reached from city 0 (cost 5) or city 4 (cost 1), so the minimum cost is 1.
*   City 2 can be reached from city 0 (cost 3).
*   City 3 can be reached from city 0 (0->2->3, cost 5), so the minimum cost is 5.
*   City 4 is a source, so the cost to reach it is 4.

This problem requires efficient graph traversal and careful handling of edge cases. The need to find shortest paths from multiple sources to all other nodes pushes the difficulty level higher.  Good luck!

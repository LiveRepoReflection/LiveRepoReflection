### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a fault-tolerant, distributed key-value cache. This cache will be used by a high-throughput system that requires low latency and high availability. The system consists of `N` cache nodes, where `N` can be a large number.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Basic Key-Value Operations:** Implement the following operations:

    *   `put(key, value, expiry)`: Stores a key-value pair in the cache with a specified expiry time (in seconds). The key is a string, the value is a byte array, and the expiry is a non-negative integer.
    *   `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a key. Returns `null` if the key is not found or has expired.
    *   `delete(key)`: Removes a key-value pair from the cache.

2.  **Distribution:** The cache should be distributed across `N` nodes. Implement a consistent hashing mechanism to distribute keys across the nodes. The distribution should be designed to minimize key movement when nodes are added or removed.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** Implement a replication strategy to ensure data is not lost if a node fails. Each key-value pair should be replicated on `R` nodes, where `R < N`.  `R` should be configurable.

4.  **Consistency:**  Implement a read repair mechanism. When a `get(key)` operation returns stale data from one replica, the system should automatically update the stale replica with the latest value. Ensure your solution considers potential race conditions during concurrent reads and writes.

5.  **Expiry:** Implement a mechanism to expire keys automatically. Expired keys should be evicted from the cache nodes. Consider the efficiency of your expiry mechanism, as it needs to scale to a large number of keys.

6.  **Concurrency:** The cache must be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent `put`, `get`, and `delete` operations.

**Constraints:**

*   **Memory Limit:** Each cache node has a limited amount of memory.  Implement an eviction policy (e.g., Least Recently Used (LRU)) to ensure the cache does not exceed its memory limit.
*   **Network Latency:** Network latency between nodes is non-negligible. Design your solution to minimize the number of network calls required for each operation.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale to a large number of nodes and a high volume of requests.
*   **Data Size:** Values can be large (up to 1MB).
*   `N` can vary from 3 to 1000
*   `R` can vary from 2 to `N-1`

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The cache must correctly implement the specified operations and meet the consistency and fault tolerance requirements.
*   **Performance:** The cache should provide low latency and high throughput for `put`, `get`, and `delete` operations.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to a large number of nodes and a high volume of requests without significant performance degradation.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be able to tolerate node failures without data loss.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be memory-efficient and minimize network calls.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for adding and removing nodes dynamically without significant downtime.
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the health and performance of the cache nodes.
*   Explore different replication strategies (e.g., chain replication) and their trade-offs.

This problem requires a strong understanding of distributed systems concepts, data structures, and algorithms. It challenges the solver to consider various trade-offs between consistency, performance, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be difficult and incorporate several complexities.

**Problem Title: Optimized Data Stream Routing**

**Problem Description:**

You are designing a high-throughput data routing system.  Incoming data streams arrive at a central routing node. Each data stream is characterized by a unique `streamId` (a positive integer), a `priority` (a non-negative integer, where lower values indicate higher priority), and a `dataSize` (a positive integer representing the amount of data in MB). The system needs to route these streams to one of several output channels.

You are given:

*   `numChannels`: The number of output channels available (numbered 0 to `numChannels` - 1).
*   `streams`: A list of `Stream` objects, each representing an incoming data stream.

```java
class Stream {
    int streamId;
    int priority;
    int dataSize;

    // Constructor and getters (omitted for brevity)
    public Stream(int streamId, int priority, int dataSize) {
        this.streamId = streamId;
        this.priority = priority;
        this.dataSize = dataSize;
    }

    public int getStreamId() {
        return streamId;
    }

    public int getPriority() {
        return priority;
    }

    public int getDataSize() {
        return dataSize;
    }
}
```

Your task is to implement a routing algorithm that assigns each stream to an output channel, subject to the following constraints and objectives:

1.  **Priority Inversion Prevention:** Higher priority streams MUST NOT be delayed by lower priority streams already being processed. A channel can only accept a new stream if either the channel is empty, or the new stream's priority is *strictly* higher than the lowest priority stream *currently* being processed in that channel.  Note that a single channel can process multiple streams concurrently.
2.  **Channel Capacity:** Each channel has a maximum capacity, `channelCapacity`, defined in MB. The sum of the `dataSize` of all streams assigned to a channel cannot exceed this capacity.
3.  **Fairness:** While perfect fairness is not always possible, the algorithm should strive to distribute the workload (total `dataSize`) as evenly as possible across all channels. Minimize the maximum difference in total `dataSize` between any two channels.
4.  **Minimizing Reassignments:** Once a stream is assigned to a channel, you want to minimize the amount of times you need to reassign this stream, if reassignment is necessary.

Your function should return a `Map<Integer, Integer>`, where the key is the `streamId` and the value is the channel number (0 to `numChannels` - 1) to which that stream has been assigned.  Return an empty map if no valid assignment is possible.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numChannels <= 100`
*   `1 <= streams.size() <= 1000`
*   `1 <= stream.streamId <= 100000` (stream IDs are unique)
*   `0 <= stream.priority <= 100`
*   `1 <= stream.dataSize <= 500`
*   `1000 <= channelCapacity <= 5000`

**Optimization Requirements:**

The solution must be efficient enough to handle a large number of streams and channels within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider the time complexity of your algorithm.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   Not all streams can be assigned due to capacity or priority conflicts.
*   A single stream's `dataSize` exceeds the `channelCapacity`.
*   A large number of streams with the same priority.
*   Significant variation in `dataSize` and `priority` across streams.

**Example:**

```java
int numChannels = 3;
int channelCapacity = 2000;
List<Stream> streams = List.of(
    new Stream(1, 10, 500),
    new Stream(2, 5, 800),
    new Stream(3, 15, 300),
    new Stream(4, 2, 700),
    new Stream(5, 8, 600)
);

Map<Integer, Integer> assignment = solve(numChannels, channelCapacity, streams);

// Possible valid output:
// {1=0, 2=1, 3=0, 4=2, 5=1}  (This is just one example, other valid assignments may exist)
```

**Clarifications:**

*   If a stream cannot be assigned to *any* channel while satisfying the constraints, that stream should *not* be included in the returned `Map`.
*   You must provide a *valid* assignment, even if it's not perfectly fair. The "fairness" requirement is for optimization, not correctness.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithmic strategies, and optimization techniques to achieve a correct and efficient solution. Good luck!

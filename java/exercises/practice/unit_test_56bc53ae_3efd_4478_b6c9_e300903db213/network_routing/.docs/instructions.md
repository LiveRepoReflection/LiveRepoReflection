## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a complex network. The network consists of `N` nodes (numbered 0 to N-1) and `M` bidirectional edges. Each edge connects two nodes and has an associated latency (a non-negative integer) and a bandwidth (a positive integer).

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology, a source node `S`, a destination node `D`, a minimum required bandwidth `B`, and a maximum acceptable latency `L`, finds the path between `S` and `D` that maximizes the available bandwidth while satisfying the given latency constraint.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 1000).
*   `edges`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, latency, bandwidth)` represents a bidirectional edge between node `u` and node `v` with the specified latency and bandwidth.  0 <= u, v < N.  0 <= latency <= 100. 1 <= bandwidth <= 1000.  There can be multiple edges between the same two nodes.
*   `S`: The source node (0 <= S < N).
*   `D`: The destination node (0 <= D < N).
*   `B`: The minimum required bandwidth (1 <= B <= 1000).
*   `L`: The maximum acceptable latency (0 <= L <= 10000).

**Output:**

*   Return the maximum achievable bandwidth among all valid paths (paths from S to D with at least B bandwidth on each edge and a total latency no more than L). If no such path exists, return -1.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The network may not be fully connected.
*   There might be multiple paths between the source and destination.
*   The path must satisfy *both* the minimum bandwidth requirement `B` *and* the maximum latency constraint `L`.
*   If multiple paths satisfy the constraints, choose the path with the highest *minimum bandwidth* along the path. This means the path's overall bandwidth is limited by the edge with the lowest bandwidth in that path, and you want to maximize this lowest bandwidth.
*   Prioritize paths with fewer hops (edges) if multiple paths have the same maximum achievable bandwidth.
*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle large networks (up to 1000 nodes and a significant number of edges).
*   Be mindful of potential integer overflow issues when calculating the total latency.
*   Think about how to represent the network efficiently for pathfinding.
*   Ensure your solution handles edge cases gracefully, such as when the source and destination are the same node, or when no path exists.
*   There can be multiple edges between the same node.

**Example:**

```
N = 4
edges = [(0, 1, 10, 500), (0, 2, 5, 200), (1, 2, 3, 300), (1, 3, 20, 800), (2, 3, 15, 400)]
S = 0
D = 3
B = 350
L = 40

Expected Output: 400

Explanation:
There are two possible paths from 0 to 3 that satisfy the bandwidth constraint B=350:
1) 0 -> 1 -> 3: Latency = 10 + 20 = 30, Bandwidth = min(500, 800) = 500
2) 0 -> 2 -> 3: Latency = 5 + 15 = 20, Bandwidth = min(200, 400) = 200
3) 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3: Latency = 10 + 3 + 15 = 28, Bandwidth = min(500, 300, 400) = 300

Because B=350, path 2 is invalid as bandwidth is 200 < 350.
Since path 1 and 3 are both valid paths, we chose path 1 as bandwidth is 500 > 300.
Since the Latency 30 < L=40, the solution is 500.

```

**Challenge:**

This problem requires careful consideration of both bandwidth and latency constraints, as well as efficient pathfinding techniques.  A naive solution will likely result in timeouts for larger test cases.  Think about which graph algorithms are best suited for this type of constrained optimization problem.

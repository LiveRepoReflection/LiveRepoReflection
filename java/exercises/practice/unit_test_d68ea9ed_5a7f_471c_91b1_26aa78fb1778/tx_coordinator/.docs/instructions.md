Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be akin to a LeetCode Hard difficulty question:

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator (DTC).  This DTC will manage transactions across multiple participating services (databases, queues, etc.).  The goal is to ensure atomicity â€“ either all services commit their changes or all roll back, even in the face of failures.

Each service is represented by a simple interface:

```java
interface Service {
    String getName(); // Unique identifier for the service
    boolean prepare(String transactionId, String data); // Attempt to prepare for commit. Returns true on success, false on failure.
    void commit(String transactionId); // Commit the prepared changes.
    void rollback(String transactionId); // Rollback any prepared changes.
}
```

Your `DistributedTransactionCoordinator` class must provide the following functionality:

1.  **`begin()`:** Starts a new transaction, generating a unique transaction ID.

2.  **`enlist(String transactionId, Service service, String data)`:** Enlists a service in the transaction.  The `data` parameter represents the specific changes that the service will perform within this transaction. The coordinator must call `service.prepare()` *before* the commit phase.

3.  **`commit(String transactionId)`:** Attempts to commit the transaction.  This involves the following steps:

    *   **Prepare Phase:**  For each enlisted service, the coordinator calls `service.prepare(transactionId, data)`. If *any* service returns `false` from `prepare()`, the transaction must be rolled back.
    *   **Commit Phase:** If all services successfully prepare, the coordinator calls `service.commit(transactionId)` for each service.
        * Log each commit and rollback actions performed by the DTC for auditing purpose

4.  **`rollback(String transactionId)`:** Rolls back the transaction.  This involves calling `service.rollback(transactionId)` for each enlisted service.
    * Log each commit and rollback actions performed by the DTC for auditing purpose

5.  **`getTransactionStatus(String transactionId)`:** Returns a string representing the transaction's status ("ACTIVE", "COMMITTED", "ROLLED_BACK").

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Concurrency:** The DTC must handle concurrent transactions safely. Multiple threads can call `begin()`, `enlist()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` simultaneously.
*   **Idempotency:** The `commit()` and `rollback()` methods on the `Service` interface should be idempotent.  That is, calling them multiple times with the same `transactionId` should have the same effect as calling them once.
*   **Service Failure Simulation:** Implement a mechanism to simulate service failures *during the prepare or commit phases*. This could be a flag on the `Service` implementation that, when set, causes the `prepare()` or `commit()` method to throw an exception or return `false` (for `prepare()`).  Your DTC must gracefully handle these failures, ensuring that all other participating services are rolled back.
*   **Timeouts:**  If a service takes too long to respond to a `prepare()`, `commit()`, or `rollback()` call, the DTC should consider it a failure and roll back the transaction.  Implement a timeout mechanism (e.g., using `Future` and `get(timeout, TimeUnit)`)
*   **Deadlock Prevention**: Design the DTC to avoid potential deadlocks when multiple transactions are running concurrently and enlisting the same services in different orders.
*   **Resource Management**: Pay attention to resource management, especially related to thread pools and potential memory leaks.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   **Minimize Latency:** Design the commit and rollback phases to be as efficient as possible, potentially using parallelism where appropriate (but ensuring correctness under concurrency).
*   **Scalability:**  Consider how your design would scale to a large number of participating services and concurrent transactions.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   **Logging:** Implement a simple logging mechanism to record the progress of transactions, including the services enlisted, the prepare results, and the commit/rollback actions.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle exceptions and errors gracefully, ensuring that the DTC remains in a consistent state.

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, transaction management principles, and error handling. It encourages thinking about real-world distributed systems challenges and trade-offs. Good luck!

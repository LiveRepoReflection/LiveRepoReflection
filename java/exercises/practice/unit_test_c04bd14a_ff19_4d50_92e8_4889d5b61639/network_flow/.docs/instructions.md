Okay, here's a hard-level Java coding problem, designed to be challenging and sophisticated.

**Project Name:** `NetworkFlowOptimizer`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the flow of data through a complex network. The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n-1`, and `m` directed edges. Each edge has a capacity, representing the maximum amount of data that can flow through it. Some nodes are designated as "source" nodes, which generate data, and others are designated as "sink" nodes, which consume data.

Your goal is to determine the maximum possible flow of data from the source nodes to the sink nodes, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity Constraint:** The flow through any edge cannot exceed its capacity.
2.  **Flow Conservation:** For every node (except source and sink nodes), the total inflow must equal the total outflow.
3.  **Multiple Sources and Sinks:** The network can have multiple source and sink nodes.
4.  **Node bandwidth limits**: Each node has a maximum bandwidth. The sum of incoming or outgoing flow cannot exceed this bandwidth.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= n <= 100).
*   `m`: The number of edges in the network (0 <= m <= n*(n-1) - no parallel edges).
*   `edges`: A 2D integer array representing the edges. Each row `edges[i]` contains three integers: `u`, `v`, and `capacity`, representing a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with the given capacity (0 <= u, v < n, 1 <= capacity <= 1000).
*   `sources`: An integer array containing the indices of the source nodes (0 <= source < n).
*   `sinks`: An integer array containing the indices of the sink nodes (0 <= sink < n).
*   `nodeBandwidths`: An integer array of size n. Each `nodeBandwidths[i]` represents the bandwidth limit for node `i` (1 <= nodeBandwidths[i] <= 5000).

**Output:**

*   The maximum possible flow from the source nodes to the sink nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   There may be multiple paths between any two nodes.
*   The same node can not be both source and sink.
*   The total number of sources and sinks is at least 1.
*   All inputs are valid and within the stated ranges.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle networks with up to 100 nodes and hundreds of edges.  Consider algorithmic complexity.
*   Memory usage should be kept to a minimum.

**Example:**

```
n = 6
m = 10
edges = {{0, 1, 16}, {0, 2, 13}, {1, 2, 10}, {1, 3, 12}, {2, 1, 4}, {2, 4, 14}, {3, 2, 9}, {3, 5, 20}, {4, 3, 7}, {4, 5, 4}}
sources = {0}
sinks = {5}
nodeBandwidths = {50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50}

Output: 23 (Maximum Flow)
```

**Clarifications:**

*   You need to implement the function that finds the maximum flow. You don't need to handle input/output or other auxiliary tasks.
*   Assume that the input is always valid.

This problem requires knowledge of network flow algorithms (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic's algorithm) and efficient implementation to handle the given constraints. The node bandwidth limitations add an extra layer of complexity and require careful consideration during the algorithm's design. Good luck!

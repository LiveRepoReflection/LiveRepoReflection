Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated.

**Problem Title: Distributed Transaction Manager**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager (DTM) for a system that involves multiple independent services. These services communicate over a network and need to perform atomic operations that span across them.

Imagine a scenario where you have two services: `AccountService` and `InventoryService`. When a user makes a purchase, you need to atomically:

1.  Debit the user's account in `AccountService`.
2.  Reduce the inventory of the purchased item in `InventoryService`.

If either of these operations fails, both operations must be rolled back, ensuring data consistency across the system.

**Your task is to implement a DTM that can coordinate these distributed transactions.**

**Requirements:**

1.  **Transaction Coordination:** The DTM must be able to start a transaction, register participating services, instruct them to perform their respective actions, and then either commit or rollback the transaction based on the outcome of all participating services.

2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:** Implement the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity. This involves:

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):** The DTM sends a "prepare" message to all participating services. Each service attempts to perform its action and, if successful, responds with a "vote commit" message. If the service fails, it responds with a "vote abort" message.
    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback Phase):** If the DTM receives "vote commit" from all services, it sends a "commit" message to all services. Otherwise, if any service voted to abort, the DTM sends a "rollback" message to all services.
3.  **Service Interface:** Define a clear interface for services to interact with the DTM. This interface should include methods for:

    *   Preparing for a transaction (receiving the "prepare" message).
    *   Committing a transaction (receiving the "commit" message).
    *   Rolling back a transaction (receiving the "rollback" message).
4.  **Concurrency:** The DTM must handle multiple concurrent transactions efficiently.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.
5.  **Failure Handling:** The DTM must be resilient to failures. Consider the following scenarios:

    *   **Service Failure:** A service might crash after voting to commit but before receiving the final commit message. The DTM should handle this gracefully, potentially by re-sending the commit message after the service recovers.
    *   **DTM Failure:** The DTM might crash during the transaction process. Upon recovery, the DTM should be able to determine the state of ongoing transactions and complete them appropriately (either by committing or rolling back).  Consider using a persistent log to record transaction states.
6.  **Optimization:**  Minimize the latency of the 2PC protocol. Consider the impact of network communication on performance and explore ways to reduce the number of messages exchanged.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   You do not need to implement actual network communication. You can simulate network communication using in-memory method calls or message queues.
*   Focus on the core logic of the DTM and the 2PC protocol. You don't need to build a fully production-ready system.
*   Services should have methods to simulate success or failure.
*   Consider the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance when designing your solution.
*   The system should be designed to be horizontally scalable (i.e. easy to add more services).
*   You can use appropriate data structures and algorithms to implement the DTM efficiently. Consider using a graph to represent dependencies between services and transactions.
*   Document your design choices and the rationale behind them.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and data structures. It also requires careful consideration of failure scenarios and optimization techniques. Good luck!

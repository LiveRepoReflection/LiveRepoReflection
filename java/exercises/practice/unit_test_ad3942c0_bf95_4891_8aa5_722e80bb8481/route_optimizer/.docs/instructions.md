Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition.

**Project Name:** `OptimalRoutePlanner`

**Question Description:**

A large logistics company, "GlobalTransit," faces a complex challenge in optimizing its delivery routes. They operate in a vast, interconnected network of cities. Each city has a varying demand for goods, and the cost of transporting goods between any two cities is not uniform and can fluctuate due to factors such as fuel prices, road conditions, and time of day.

GlobalTransit needs a system to determine the most cost-effective routes for delivering goods from a central depot to all other cities in their network, while also considering the constraints of vehicle capacity and delivery time windows.

**Specifically, you are tasked with implementing a route planning algorithm that meets the following requirements:**

1.  **Input:**
    *   A weighted directed graph representing the city network.
        *   Nodes represent cities. One node will be designated as the depot.
        *   Edges represent transportation routes between cities. Each edge has a cost (a floating-point number) and a transit time (an integer).
    *   A list of cities with their respective demand for goods (an integer).
    *   A vehicle capacity (an integer) representing the maximum amount of goods a single vehicle can carry.
    *   A maximum route duration (an integer) representing the maximum time a vehicle can spend on a single route.
    *   A global cost multiplier (a floating-point number) that should be applied to the total cost calculated.

2.  **Constraints:**
    *   Each city's demand must be fully satisfied.
    *   A vehicle's total load on any route must not exceed its capacity.
    *   The total transit time of any route must not exceed the maximum route duration.
    *   A city can be visited by multiple vehicles if necessary to fulfill its demand.
    *   Goods must be delivered from the depot to each city. All routes must start and end at the depot.

3.  **Output:**
    *   A list of routes. Each route should specify:
        *   The sequence of cities visited (including the depot at the beginning and end).
        *   The total cost of the route (considering edge costs and the global cost multiplier).
        *   The total amount of goods delivered on the route.
        *   The total transit time of the route.
    *   The routes should be designed to minimize the total cost across all routes.

4.  **Optimization:**
    *   The primary goal is to minimize the total cost of all routes.
    *   Consider efficiency. The algorithm should be able to handle networks with thousands of cities and routes.
    *   Consider providing a result within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., a few minutes for large datasets).

5.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle cases where no feasible solution exists (e.g., insufficient vehicle capacity, unreachable cities, too short duration to fulfill all demand). In such cases, the program should return a specific error code or throw an exception.
    *   Handle cases where the depot has no outgoing edges.
    *   Handle zero demand for a city.

6.  **Advanced Considerations (for extra points):**
    *   Implement a multi-threading strategy to explore multiple route combinations in parallel.
    *   Incorporate a local search optimization technique (e.g., simulated annealing, tabu search) to refine the initial solution and escape local optima.
    *   Dynamically adjust the global cost multiplier based on the number of vehicles used. The goal is to penalize solutions using a large number of vehicles.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must satisfy all constraints and deliver the required goods to each city.
*   Cost Minimization: The solution will be compared against other submissions to determine which achieves the lowest total cost.
*   Efficiency: The execution time and memory usage of the solution will be considered, especially for large datasets.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   Handling of Edge Cases: The solution should gracefully handle all specified edge cases.
*   Advanced Features (if implemented): Solutions incorporating multi-threading or local search optimization will be given bonus points.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (shortest path, possibly some variant of Dijkstra's or A\*), optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints and edge cases. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Java coding problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

`DistributedTransactionCoordinator`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for a system consisting of multiple independent services. The goal is to ensure atomicity and consistency across these services when performing operations that require changes in multiple services.

Each service exposes an interface for `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` operations within a transaction. The DTC orchestrates these operations to guarantee either all services successfully commit the transaction, or all services roll back any changes.

Specifically, you need to implement the following:

1.  **Transaction ID Generation:**  A mechanism to generate unique transaction IDs (UUIDs).

2.  **Transaction Management:**  A central component (the DTC) that manages the lifecycle of distributed transactions.  The DTC should:
    *   Initiate a transaction, assigning it a unique ID.
    *   Register participating services for a given transaction. Each service will be registered with the DTC along with its `prepare`, `commit`, and `rollback` interfaces (you can represent these as functional interfaces/lambdas in Java).
    *   Orchestrate the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol:
        *   **Prepare Phase:**  Send the `prepare()` command to all registered services.  The DTC should collect the responses from each service. Each service should return `true` for prepared successfully, or `false` otherwise.
        *   **Commit/Rollback Phase:**
            *   If all services respond positively to the `prepare()` command, the DTC sends the `commit()` command to all services.
            *   If any service responds negatively (or fails to respond within a timeout), the DTC sends the `rollback()` command to all services.

3.  **Concurrency Handling:**  The DTC must be able to handle multiple concurrent transactions. Ensure thread safety.

4.  **Timeout Handling:**  Implement timeouts for both the `prepare()` and `commit/rollback()` phases. If a service doesn't respond within the allotted time, consider it a failure and initiate rollback for all participants.

5.  **Error Handling:**  Handle potential exceptions that may arise during the transaction lifecycle (e.g., network errors, service failures).

6.  **Idempotency:** Services should ideally implement their prepare, commit and rollback actions in an idempotent manner.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The number of participating services in a transaction can vary.
*   Services can fail at any point during the transaction lifecycle.
*   Network latency between the DTC and services can be significant.
*   The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement the DTC using Java.
*   Focus on correctness, concurrency, and fault tolerance.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficiency.
*   Provide clear and concise code with comments.
*   Demonstrate the usage of your DTC with a simple example involving mock services (e.g., a banking system where transferring funds requires updates to two different account services).

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Minimize the overall transaction time.
*   Reduce the load on participating services.
*   Design for scalability to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and services.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and exception handling. It also necessitates careful design to ensure robustness and performance. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Java coding problem designed to be LeetCode "Hard" level, focusing on algorithm design, data structures, and efficiency:

**Problem Title:**  Parallel Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Resource Constraints

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a task scheduler for a high-performance computing cluster.  The system needs to execute a set of independent tasks, each with dependencies on other tasks. These tasks must be scheduled on a cluster with a limited number of available resources.

Specifically, you are given:

*   `n`:  The number of tasks, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `dependencies`: A list of dependencies represented as a 2D integer array where `dependencies[i] = [task_a, task_b]` means `task_b` depends on `task_a` (i.e., `task_a` must complete before `task_b` can start). The dependencies are guaranteed to form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   `resources`: An integer representing the total number of available resource units in the cluster.
*   `taskResources`: An integer array of length `n`, where `taskResources[i]` denotes the number of resource units required to execute `task i`.
*   `taskExecutionTimes`: An integer array of length `n`, where `taskExecutionTimes[i]` denotes the execution time (in arbitrary time units) of `task i`.

Your goal is to write a function that calculates the **minimum** makespan (total completion time) for executing all `n` tasks, adhering to the dependencies and resource constraints. The tasks can be executed in parallel if dependencies and resources allow.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= dependencies.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2` (Maximum possible dependencies in a DAG).
*   `1 <= resources <= 100`
*   `1 <= taskResources[i] <= resources` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `1 <= taskExecutionTimes[i] <= 100` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
*   The dependencies guarantee there are no cycles.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The goal is to minimize the makespan. Inefficient algorithms that perform exhaustive searches are unlikely to pass within a reasonable time limit.
*   Consider using dynamic programming, topological sorting, or greedy approaches combined with careful resource management to achieve optimal or near-optimal solutions.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

*   No dependencies: All tasks are independent and can run in parallel.
*   Chain dependencies: Tasks form a linear chain (task 1 depends on task 0, task 2 depends on task 1, etc.).
*   Tasks with zero dependencies but requiring all resources, effectively serializing execution.
*   Tasks with high resource needs but short execution times versus tasks with low resource needs but long execution times.

**Example:**

```
n = 4
dependencies = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
resources = 10
taskResources = [3, 4, 2, 5]
taskExecutionTimes = [2, 3, 1, 4]

Output: 7
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Tasks 0, 1, and 2 can start immediately (Task 0, Task 1 and Task 2 have no dependencies).
2.  We could start Task 0 and Task 1 in parallel.
3.  Task 0 finishes at time 2, Task 1 finishes at time 3.  Since task 0 and Task 1 run in parallel, the resource usage will be 3 + 4 = 7 <= 10.
4.  Task 2 can start at time 0 and finishes at time 1. Since Task 2 runs in parallel, the resource usage will be 2 <= 10.
5.  Task 3 can start after both Task 1 and Task 2 are complete. Task 1 finishes at time 3 and Task 2 finishes at time 1. Task 3 will start at time 3.
6.  Task 3 finishes at time 3 + 4 = 7.
7.  Therefore, the makespan is 7.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking, careful resource management, and an understanding of dependency relationships. Good luck!

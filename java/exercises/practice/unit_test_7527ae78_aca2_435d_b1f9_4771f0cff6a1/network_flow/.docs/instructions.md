## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and optimizing a data distribution network for a large-scale content delivery network (CDN). The network consists of data centers (nodes) connected by communication links (edges), each with a limited bandwidth capacity. Your goal is to efficiently route data from a single source data center to multiple destination data centers, maximizing the total amount of data delivered while respecting the bandwidth constraints of the links.

Specifically, you are given:

*   `n`: The number of data centers, numbered from 0 to n-1.
*   `edges`: A list of directed edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(u, v, capacity)`. This indicates a link from data center `u` to data center `v` with a maximum bandwidth capacity of `capacity`.
*   `source`: The index of the source data center.
*   `destinations`: A list of indices representing the destination data centers.

Your task is to implement a function `max_flow(n, edges, source, destinations)` that calculates the maximum possible total data flow from the source to all specified destinations. The data flow to each destination contributes to the total data flow.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   The network can contain cycles.
*   Multiple edges can exist between two nodes, even in the same direction.
*   The capacity of each edge is a non-negative integer.
*   The number of nodes (`n`) can be large (up to 1000).
*   The number of edges can also be large (up to 10000).
*   The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Naive algorithms will likely time out.
*   You should aim for an algorithm with a good worst-case time complexity. Consider algorithms like Edmonds-Karp or Dinic's algorithm, and their associated space and runtime implications.
*   Ensure that your solution handles edge cases such as:
    *   Empty network (no edges).
    *   Source and destination are the same node.
    *   No path exists between the source and any of the destinations.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The solution should be optimized for performance. The test cases will include large networks, so an inefficient solution might exceed the time limit. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize the computational cost. Also, consider any possible integer overflow issues when calculating flow.

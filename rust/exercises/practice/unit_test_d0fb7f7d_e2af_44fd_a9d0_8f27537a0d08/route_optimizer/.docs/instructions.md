Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be on par with a LeetCode Hard difficulty. It involves graph algorithms, optimizations, and real-world considerations.

**Problem Title:** Autonomous Vehicle Route Optimization under Dynamic Constraints

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you're building the routing system for a fleet of autonomous vehicles operating in a large, dynamic urban environment. Your goal is to design a highly efficient and robust route planning algorithm that can handle real-time constraints.

The city is represented as a directed graph. Each node represents an intersection, and each directed edge represents a road segment between intersections. Each road segment has a base travel time (in seconds).

However, the travel time along a road segment isn't static. It can be affected by real-time events like traffic congestion, road closures, or special events.  Therefore, each road segment also has a "congestion factor" which can vary over time. The effective travel time is calculated as `base_travel_time * congestion_factor`. The congestion factor is always >= 1.0.

Furthermore, certain intersections (nodes) might have "restricted access periods" due to construction, deliveries, or other reasons.  During these periods, autonomous vehicles are not allowed to enter the intersection. You're given a list of time intervals for each intersection when it's restricted.

Your task is to write a function that, given a starting intersection, a destination intersection, a departure time (in seconds from the start of the day), the graph representation, and the dynamic constraint information, finds the *minimum travel time* to reach the destination.

**Input:**

*   `start_node: usize`: The index of the starting intersection.
*   `end_node: usize`: The index of the destination intersection.
*   `departure_time: u64`: The departure time (in seconds since the start of the day).
*   `graph: &Vec<Vec<(usize, u64, f64)>>`: A vector of vectors representing the directed graph. `graph[i]` contains a list of tuples `(neighbor, base_travel_time, initial_congestion_factor)` representing the road segments originating from intersection `i`.
*   `congestion_updates: &Vec<(usize, usize, u64, f64)>`: A vector of congestion updates. Each tuple `(start_node, end_node, timestamp, congestion_factor)` represents a change in the congestion factor on the road segment from `start_node` to `end_node` occurring at `timestamp`.  There can be multiple updates for the same edge at different timestamps.
*   `restricted_access: &Vec<(usize, Vec<(u64, u64)>)>`: A vector of restricted access periods for intersections. Each tuple `(node, intervals)` represents an intersection and a list of time intervals `(start_time, end_time)` (in seconds) when the intersection is inaccessible. The `start_time` and `end_time` are inclusive.

**Output:**

*   `Option<u64>`: The minimum travel time (in seconds) to reach the destination, or `None` if no route exists.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of intersections (`n`) can be up to 10,000.
*   The number of road segments (`m`) can be up to 50,000.
*   The number of congestion updates can be up to 100,000.
*   The number of restricted access periods can be up to 5,000.
*   The `departure_time`, `base_travel_time`, `start_time`, and `end_time` are non-negative integers that can be represented by `u64`.
*   The `congestion_factor` is a floating-point number greater than or equal to 1.0.
*   You must consider the time-dependent nature of the graph (congestion and restricted access).
*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle large graphs and a significant number of updates within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).
*   Assume that the congestion factor remains constant between updates.
*   Assume that the input data is valid (e.g., `start_node` and `end_node` are within the graph bounds).

**Example:**

(A simplified example to illustrate the concept)

```
start_node = 0
end_node = 2
departure_time = 0

graph = vec![
    vec![(1, 10, 1.0)], // Node 0 -> Node 1, base time 10, congestion 1.0
    vec![(2, 15, 1.0)], // Node 1 -> Node 2, base time 15, congestion 1.0
    vec![],
];

congestion_updates = vec![
    (0, 1, 5, 2.0), // Node 0 -> Node 1, at time 5, congestion changes to 2.0
];

restricted_access = vec![
    (2, vec![(20, 30)]), // Node 2 is restricted from time 20 to 30
];
```

In this example, the optimal path is 0 -> 1 -> 2.

*   Travel from 0 to 1: Departure at time 0. Congestion updates at time 5. So from 0 to 5 congestion will be 1.0, and from 5 onwards it will be 2.0. Arrival at Node 1 will be at time 10 (since 10 < 5 is false, we use the congestion 2.0, 10*1.0).
*   Travel from 1 to 2: Departure from Node 1 will be at time 10. Arrival at Node 2 will be at time 25 (15*1.0).
*   Since restricted access to node 2 happens from time 20 to 30, arrival time (25) lies within this interval, so we have to wait until time 30 to move forward.
*   Since there is no further movement, the final arrival time is 30 and the total travel time is 30.

**Key Considerations for Solving:**

*   **Efficient Graph Traversal:**  Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search (if you can devise a suitable heuristic) are good starting points.  However, you need to adapt them to handle the time-dependent edge weights.
*   **Data Structures for Congestion Updates:**  Consider how to efficiently query the congestion factor for a given edge at a given time. A sorted data structure (e.g., a binary search tree or a sorted vector) could be helpful.
*   **Handling Restricted Access:**  You need to check for restricted access periods at each intersection you might enter and potentially delay your departure time accordingly.
*   **Optimization:**  Given the large constraints, optimization is crucial. Consider using techniques like:
    *   Early stopping: If the current shortest path estimate to the destination is already longer than a known path, you can prune the search.
    *   Heaps:  Use a min-heap to efficiently select the next node to explore in Dijkstra's algorithm.
    *   Avoiding unnecessary calculations: Only recalculate edge weights when the congestion factor changes.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. It simulates a real-world scenario where constraints are dynamic and efficiency is paramount. Good luck!

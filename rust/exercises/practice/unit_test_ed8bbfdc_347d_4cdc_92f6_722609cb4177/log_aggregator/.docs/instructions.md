Okay, here is a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode "Hard" level problem, focusing on algorithmic efficiency, advanced data structures, and handling edge cases.

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Log Aggregation

**Description:**

You are designing a system for aggregating transaction logs from a distributed microservice architecture.  Each microservice generates transaction logs, and these logs need to be periodically aggregated into a central data store for analysis and auditing. However, the logs are generated asynchronously and can arrive out of order due to network latency and microservice restarts. The logs arrive with timestamps indicating their actual occurrence time.

Your task is to implement a system that efficiently aggregates these out-of-order transaction logs, ensuring that the final aggregated log is in chronological order based on the transaction timestamps.  You need to handle a massive volume of logs arriving from thousands of microservices concurrently.  Memory usage is a critical concern, as you're dealing with potentially billions of logs.  The system must also be resilient to microservice failures, which can result in duplicate log entries.

**Input:**

The system receives a stream of `LogEntry` structs via a channel. Each `LogEntry` contains the following fields:

*   `timestamp`: `u64` (Unix timestamp in milliseconds representing when the transaction occurred)
*   `service_id`: `u32` (Unique identifier for the microservice that generated the log)
*   `transaction_id`: `u64` (Unique identifier for the transaction, allowing for de-duplication)
*   `log_message`: `String` (The actual log message)

**Output:**

The system should output a vector of `LogEntry` structs, sorted in ascending order by `timestamp`. The output must contain only unique log entries (identified by `transaction_id`). The system should produce a final aggregated and ordered log efficiently.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** The system must handle a very high volume of incoming log entries (millions per second).
2.  **Memory Efficiency:**  Minimize memory usage to avoid out-of-memory errors when dealing with a massive number of log entries.  Consider using techniques like bounded data structures or external sorting if appropriate.
3.  **De-duplication:**  Eliminate duplicate log entries based on the `transaction_id`.
4.  **Chronological Ordering:** The final output must be strictly sorted by the `timestamp` field.
5.  **Concurrency:**  The system must be thread-safe and handle concurrent log entries from multiple sources.
6.  **Latency:** Aim for minimal latency in producing the final aggregated log.
7.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be designed such that no data is lost in case of abrupt termination of the aggregation process. This might involve checkpointing or similar mechanisms.
8.  **Bounded Delay:** You can assume there is a maximum delay (e.g. 1 hour) for logs to arrive. Logs arriving more than 1 hour late can be discarded.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Choosing the right data structures to balance insertion, deletion, and sorting efficiency.
*   Employing parallel processing to speed up sorting and de-duplication.
*   Utilizing techniques like bloom filters to efficiently check for duplicates before inserting into the main data structure.
*   Considering a multi-stage aggregation process where logs are initially aggregated in smaller chunks and then merged.

This problem requires a careful balance of data structures, algorithms, and concurrency to achieve optimal performance and scalability. Good luck!

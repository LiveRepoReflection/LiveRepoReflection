## Problem: Decentralized Trust Network Analysis

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a system to analyze a decentralized trust network. This network represents relationships between users in a distributed system where trust is not centrally managed. Each user maintains a local view of the network, storing trust scores for a subset of other users. These trust scores are directional and represent the degree to which one user trusts another.

The system receives streams of trust assertions. Each assertion is a tuple `(user_id_a, user_id_b, trust_score)`, indicating that user `user_id_a` trusts user `user_id_b` with the given `trust_score`. Trust scores are floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive, where 0.0 means no trust and 1.0 means complete trust.

Your goal is to efficiently answer queries about the "trust path" between any two users in the network. A trust path is a sequence of users `[user_1, user_2, ..., user_n]` such that there exists a trust assertion from `user_1` to `user_2`, from `user_2` to `user_3`, and so on, until `user_n`.  The "trust value" of a path is the *minimum* trust score along that path.

**The main problem you must solve is to find the highest possible trust value among *all* possible trust paths between a given source and destination user.**

**Constraints:**

1.  **Scale:** The system must handle a large number of users (up to 1 million) and trust assertions (up to 100 million).
2.  **Real-time Updates:** Trust assertions arrive in a continuous stream and must be incorporated into the network data structure efficiently. The system must be able to answer queries accurately even as the network is being updated.
3.  **Memory Usage:** Memory usage should be optimized. You cannot store all possible paths between all pairs of users.
4.  **Query Performance:** Queries for the highest trust path value between two users must be answered as quickly as possible, ideally in sub-second time even for distant users.
5.  **Dynamic Network:** The network is dynamic. Trust assertions can be added *and removed*. A removal is indicated by a tuple `(user_id_a, user_id_b, None)`, where `None` represents that the trust relationship between `user_id_a` and `user_id_b` should be removed.
6.  **Concurrency:** The system will be accessed concurrently by multiple threads adding trust assertions and querying for trust paths. Your data structures must be thread-safe.
7. **Floats:** Due to floating-point precision issues, trust values returned should be accurate to at least 4 decimal places.

**Input:**

*   A stream of trust assertions, each represented as a tuple `(user_id_a: u32, user_id_b: u32, trust_score: Option<f64>)`. `trust_score` is `Some(f64)` for additions and `None` for removals.
*   Queries, each represented as a tuple `(source_user_id: u32, destination_user_id: u32)`.

**Output:**

*   For each query, output the highest trust value (f64) among all possible trust paths between the source and destination users. If no path exists, output 0.0.

**Example:**

```
// Stream of Trust Assertions:
(1, 2, Some(0.8))
(2, 3, Some(0.9))
(1, 3, Some(0.5))  // Direct path from 1 to 3

// Query:
(1, 3)

// Output:
0.8 // Path 1 -> 2 -> 3 has trust value min(0.8, 0.9) = 0.8.  Path 1 -> 3 has trust value 0.5.  The maximum is 0.8.

// Another assertion
(2, 3, None) // remove trust from 2 -> 3

// Query:
(1, 3)

// Output:
0.5
```

**Considerations:**

*   How will you represent the trust network to efficiently handle updates and queries?
*   Which algorithm will you use to find the highest trust path value?
*   How will you optimize your solution to meet the performance requirements?
*   How will you handle concurrency and ensure data consistency?
*   What data structures offer the best trade-offs between memory usage and query performance? Consider specialized graph structures or indexes.
*   How can you design your system to be resilient to errors and handle large-scale data?

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, concurrency, and optimization techniques. A naive solution will likely be too slow or consume too much memory. Good luck!

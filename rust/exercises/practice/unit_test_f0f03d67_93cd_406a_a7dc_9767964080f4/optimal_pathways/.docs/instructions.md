Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed for a high-level programming competition, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world considerations.

**Project Name:** `OptimalPathways`

**Question Description:**

A large logistics company is optimizing its delivery network. The network consists of `n` distribution centers (nodes) connected by various routes (edges). Each route has a travel time (in minutes), a cost (in USD), and a maximum weight capacity (in kilograms).

The company needs to ship a specific amount of goods (in kilograms) from a source distribution center `s` to a destination distribution center `d`. The goods *must* be shipped in their entirety; partial shipments are not allowed.

Furthermore, the company operates under a strict SLA (Service Level Agreement). The shipment *must* arrive at the destination within a given time limit `t` (in minutes).

**Your Task:**

Write a Rust function that determines the *minimum cost* to ship the goods from the source `s` to the destination `d` within the time limit `t`, while respecting the weight capacities of the routes.  If it's impossible to ship the goods within the constraints, return `None`.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of distribution centers (nodes).  Nodes are numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a route: `(source_node, destination_node, travel_time, cost, weight_capacity)`.
*   `s`: The source distribution center (node index).
*   `d`: The destination distribution center (node index).
*   `t`: The maximum allowed travel time (in minutes).
*   `goods_weight`: The total weight of the goods to be shipped (in kilograms).

**Output:**

*   `Option<u64>`: The minimum cost (in USD) to ship the goods from `s` to `d` within the time limit and weight capacity constraints. Return `None` if no such path exists.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Large Input Sizes:**  `n` can be up to 1000, and the number of edges can be up to 5000. Aim for an efficient algorithm.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no path exists, the source and destination are the same, the goods are too heavy for any route, or the time limit is impossible to meet.
*   **Optimization:** The goal is to minimize *cost*, subject to the time and weight constraints. Multiple paths might exist that satisfy the constraints; choose the cheapest one.
*   **Weight Capacity:** Ensure that the goods' weight does not exceed the `weight_capacity` of any edge along the chosen path.
*   **Non-Negative Values:**  All travel times, costs, and weight capacities are non-negative integers.
*   **Directed Graph:** The graph is directed.  An edge from `A` to `B` does not imply an edge from `B` to `A`.
*   **Multiple Edges:** There can be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.
*   **Cycles:** The graph may contain cycles.  Be careful to avoid infinite loops.

**Example:**

```rust
// Example graph:
// 0 --(10, 5, 100)--> 1 --(20, 10, 50)--> 2
//  \--------------------(30, 15, 75)------>/
let n = 3;
let edges = vec![
    (0, 1, 10, 5, 100),
    (1, 2, 20, 10, 50),
    (0, 2, 30, 15, 75),
];
let s = 0;
let d = 2;
let t = 40;
let goods_weight = 40;

// Expected output: Some(25)  (path 0 -> 1 -> 2 is cheaper than 0 -> 2)
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal (potentially Dijkstra's or A\*), constraint satisfaction, and optimization techniques. The large input sizes necessitate careful algorithm selection and implementation to avoid timeouts. Good luck!

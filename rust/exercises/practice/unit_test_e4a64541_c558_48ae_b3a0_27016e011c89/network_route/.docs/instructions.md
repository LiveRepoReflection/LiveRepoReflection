Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Rust coding problem. Here it is:

**Project Name:** `OptimizedNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a highly optimized network routing algorithm for a data center. The data center consists of `N` servers, uniquely identified by integers from `0` to `N-1`.  Servers are interconnected via bidirectional network links. The network topology can be represented as a weighted, undirected graph, where servers are nodes and links are edges. The weight of each edge represents the latency (in milliseconds) of sending data across that link.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology and a set of routing requests, determines the optimal path for each request to minimize the average latency across all requests.

**Input:**

*   `N: usize`: The number of servers in the data center.
*   `edges: Vec<(usize, usize, u32)>`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents a bidirectional network link between server `u` and server `v` with latency `w`.  `u` and `v` are server IDs (0 to N-1), and `w` is the latency (in milliseconds) of the link.  Assume no duplicate edges are provided (i.e., no two tuples exist with the same `u` and `v` values).
*   `requests: Vec<(usize, usize)>`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(src, dest)` represents a routing request. `src` is the source server ID, and `dest` is the destination server ID.  Each request needs to be fulfilled by finding a path from `src` to `dest`.

**Output:**

*   `Vec<Vec<usize>>`: A vector of vectors.  The i-th vector in the output represents the optimal path (sequence of server IDs) for the i-th request in the `requests` input.  The path must start with the source server ID and end with the destination server ID. If no path exists for a request, return an empty vector (`Vec::new()`) for that request.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Large Scale:** The number of servers `N` can be up to 10,000. The number of edges can be up to 50,000. The number of requests can be up to 10,000.
2.  **Latency Minimization:** The primary objective is to minimize the *average* latency across all routing requests. For a single request, the latency of a path is the sum of the latencies of the edges along that path.
3.  **Time Limit:** Your solution must execute within a strict time limit (e.g., 10 seconds). This necessitates efficient algorithms and data structures.
4.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where:
    *   A server cannot reach the destination server for a particular request.
    *   The graph is disconnected.
    *   The input graph contains cycles.
    *   Source and destination are the same for a request.

5.  **Optimization Considerations:** Consider these optimizations:
    *   **Pre-computation:**  Can you pre-compute any information about the graph to speed up the routing process for multiple requests? (e.g., all-pairs shortest paths, centrality measures).  Think about the trade-offs between pre-computation time and per-request routing time.
    *   **Algorithm Choice:**  Carefully select an appropriate pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra, A*, Floyd-Warshall).  Dijkstra or A* will likely be suitable for individual requests, but all-pairs algorithms might be beneficial if the number of requests is high.
    *   **Data Structures:** Use efficient data structures to represent the graph and priority queues (if needed) to optimize algorithm performance.  Consider using `HashMap` and `BinaryHeap`.
6.  **Rust Specifics:** The solution should be idiomatic Rust, making effective use of Rust's features like ownership, borrowing, and error handling. The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable. Avoid unnecessary cloning.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1.  **Correctness:** Does your solution find valid paths for all requests and return empty vectors when no path exists?
2.  **Average Latency:** How close is your solution to the optimal average latency across all requests?  Solutions with lower average latency will score higher.
3.  **Runtime Performance:** Does your solution execute within the time limit, especially for large input sizes?
4.  **Code Quality:** Is your code well-structured, readable, and idiomatic Rust?

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

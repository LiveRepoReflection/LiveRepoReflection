Okay, here's a challenging problem for a Rust programming competition, designed to be "LeetCode Hard" level.

**Project Name:** `NetworkPartitioning`

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are designing the core of a distributed database system. A key challenge is to efficiently manage data consistency and availability when network partitions occur. A network partition is when some nodes in the system can no longer communicate with other nodes, effectively splitting the system into isolated groups.

You are given a representation of a network of database nodes. The network consists of `n` nodes, labeled from `0` to `n-1`. The connections between the nodes are represented by a list of undirected edges.

Your task is to write a function `min_cut` that takes the following inputs:

*   `n: usize`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges: Vec<(usize, usize)>`: A list of tuples representing the edges in the network. Each tuple `(u, v)` represents an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
*   `k: usize`: An integer representing the **maximum size of the *smallest* partition.** That is, the algorithm should find a cut that results in at least one group of nodes of size at most `k`.

Your function must find the **minimum number of edges that must be cut** to partition the network into at least two disconnected components such that *at least one of the components has a size of at most `k` nodes*. The size of a component is the number of nodes in that component.

If no such cut exists, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= edges.len() <= n * (n - 1) / 2` (The maximum number of possible edges in an undirected graph).
*   `1 <= k <= n / 2` (It only make sense to cut for partition with group size at most half the total number of nodes)
*   The graph may or may not be connected initially.
*   The solution must be reasonably efficient. A naive brute-force approach will likely time out for larger test cases. Consider using efficient graph algorithms.
*   The function signature must be: `fn min_cut(n: usize, edges: Vec<(usize, usize)>, k: usize) -> i32`

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
k = 2

The optimal cut is to remove the edge (2, 3). This results in two components: {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4}. The smaller component has size 2, which is less than or equal to k. The minimum cut size is 1.
```

**Scoring:**

The solution will be evaluated based on correctness and efficiency. Test cases will include:

*   Small graphs that can be solved with brute force.
*   Larger graphs that require more efficient algorithms.
*   Disconnected graphs.
*   Graphs where no valid cut exists.
*   Graphs with a high density of edges.

**Hints (But try without these first!):**

*   Think about graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore connected components.
*   Consider using an algorithm to find all possible cuts in a graph (or a way to generate them efficiently). You don't necessarily need to find *all* cuts, but you need to explore enough to find the minimum one that meets the size constraint.
*   The Stoer-Wagner algorithm is a good one to solve this problem.
*   Be mindful of edge cases and potential integer overflow issues.
*   Optimize your code for speed. The time limit will be strict.

This problem combines graph theory, algorithmic thinking, and performance optimization, making it a truly challenging task. Good luck!

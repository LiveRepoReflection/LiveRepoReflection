## Question: Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Voting Simulation

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a simulation of a voting system for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The DAO operates on a blockchain-like network. Each proposal submitted to the DAO requires a vote from its members. Your system needs to handle a large number of members, proposals, and complex voting rules, while ensuring data integrity and efficient query performance.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Member Management:**
    *   Each member has a unique ID (unsigned 64-bit integer) and a voting power (unsigned 64-bit integer).
    *   Implement efficient methods to add, remove, and update member voting power. These operations should be optimized for frequent modifications.
2.  **Proposal Submission:**
    *   Each proposal has a unique ID (unsigned 64-bit integer), a description (string), and a voting start/end timestamp (unsigned 64-bit integer, representing Unix epoch time).
    *   Proposals can only be created with a future end time.
    *   Proposals must be immutable once created.
3.  **Voting:**
    *   Members can vote "For", "Against," or "Abstain" on each proposal.
    *   Each vote must be associated with the member ID, proposal ID, and vote option (enum).
    *   Votes are weighted by the member's voting power at the *time the vote is cast*.
    *   Only one vote per member per proposal is allowed.  If a member votes multiple times on the same proposal, only the *first* vote is counted; subsequent votes are ignored.
    *   Votes can only be cast within the proposal's start and end timestamps. Votes outside this window should be rejected. The simulation does NOT need to account for clock drift.
4.  **Vote Counting:**
    *   Implement a function to efficiently calculate the voting results for a given proposal. The results should include the total voting power for "For", "Against", and "Abstain".
    *   The calculation should be optimized to handle scenarios with millions of votes.
5.  **Outcome Determination:**
    *   The DAO has configurable voting rules:
        *   **Quorum:** The minimum total voting power required for a proposal to be considered valid (unsigned 64-bit integer).
        *   **Threshold:** The minimum percentage of "For" votes (relative to the sum of "For" and "Against" votes) required for a proposal to pass (floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0). Abstain votes do not count towards the threshold.
    *   Implement a function to determine if a proposal passes based on the voting results and the DAO's voting rules.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of members (millions), proposals (thousands), and votes (millions).
*   **Performance:** Vote counting and outcome determination should be highly optimized. Aim for sub-second response times even with millions of votes.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure that votes are immutable and cannot be tampered with.  Consider how to detect and prevent double-voting (though only the first vote needs to be counted).
*   **Concurrency:** The system should be thread-safe, allowing multiple members to vote concurrently.
*   **Memory Usage:**  Be mindful of memory usage, especially when storing votes and calculating results. Consider appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize memory footprint.
*   **Timestamp Handling:** Accurately handle timestamps to enforce voting window constraints.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for invalid inputs and unexpected conditions.
*   **Optimizations:** Explore various optimization techniques, such as indexing, caching, and parallel processing, to improve performance.
*   **Mutability:** After creating the proposal, description and voting start/end timestamp **must** be immutable. You should consider using appropriate data structure to achieve this.

**Input:**

Your code should provide functions to:

*   Add/Remove/Update members and their voting power.
*   Create proposals.
*   Cast votes.
*   Calculate voting results for a proposal.
*   Determine if a proposal passes based on the results and voting rules.

**Output:**

The `calculate_voting_results` function should return a struct containing the total voting power for "For," "Against," and "Abstain." The `determine_outcome` function should return a boolean indicating whether the proposal passes or fails.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism to allow members to delegate their voting power to other members.
*   Add support for different voting strategies (e.g., quadratic voting).
*   Implement a simple blockchain-like structure to store proposals and votes in a tamper-proof manner (without actually implementing a full blockchain).

This question requires a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

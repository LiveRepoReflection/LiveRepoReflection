Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed with your specifications in mind.

**Problem Title:**  Intergalactic Logistics Network Optimization

**Problem Description:**

The Intergalactic Confederation (IC) is facing a critical logistical bottleneck. They need to efficiently transport resources between various planetary outposts connected by wormholes.  Each wormhole has a specific capacity, representing the maximum amount of resources that can traverse it in a given time unit. Furthermore, traversing a wormhole incurs a cost in energy, which varies depending on the wormhole and the amount of resources being transported.

You are tasked with designing an algorithm to optimize the resource flow through the Intergalactic Logistics Network (ILN).  The ILN can be represented as a directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent planetary outposts.
*   Edges represent wormholes connecting outposts.
*   Each edge has a `capacity` (maximum resource flow) and a `cost_function`.
*   The `cost_function` takes an amount of resources `flow` as input and returns the energy cost of transporting that amount through the wormhole. The cost function is guaranteed to be monotonically increasing with respect to `flow`, but it can be non-linear.

Given:

*   A graph representing the ILN (planetary outposts and wormholes).
*   A source planetary outpost (where resources originate).
*   A sink planetary outpost (where resources need to be delivered).
*   A total resource demand at the sink outpost.

Your goal is to determine the minimum total energy cost required to transport the demanded amount of resources from the source to the sink, respecting wormhole capacities.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** You must design a suitable data structure in Rust to represent the directed graph, including nodes, edges, capacities, and cost functions. Consider using adjacency lists or matrices.

2.  **Cost Functions:**  The `cost_function` for each wormhole will be provided as a function pointer or a trait object implementing a `cost` method.  Your algorithm must be able to handle different types of cost functions (e.g., linear, quadratic, piecewise linear).

3.  **Optimization:** The algorithm must find the *minimum* total energy cost.  Suboptimal solutions will not be accepted.

4.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be reasonably efficient. The ILN can be large (up to 1000 outposts and 5000 wormholes). Inefficient algorithms will time out.

5.  **Resource Splitting:** The algorithm must allow resources to be split across multiple paths if it leads to a lower total cost.

6.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   The graph may not be fully connected.
    *   Multiple paths may exist between the source and sink.
    *   The demand may exceed the total capacity of the network. In this case, return an error or a special value indicating that the demand cannot be met.
    *   Cycles may exist in the graph. The algorithm must handle cycles appropriately to avoid infinite loops.
    *   Wormhole capacities and resource demand can be integers or floating-point numbers. The choice should be made according to optimization requirement.

7.  **Rust Features:** You are encouraged to utilize Rust's advanced features like traits, generics, and smart pointers to create a robust and efficient solution.

8.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle invalid input or infeasible scenarios.

This problem combines graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and Rust's features to create a challenging and realistic scenario. The variety of cost functions and the need for efficiency make it a difficult problem.

## The Quantum Network Routing Problem

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a nascent quantum communication network. This network consists of `n` quantum nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Unlike classical networks, quantum communication relies on entanglement, a fragile resource susceptible to decoherence.

The network topology is represented by a weighted, undirected graph.  `edges` is a vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with a *decoherence cost* of `w`. The decoherence cost quantifies the loss of entanglement fidelity when transmitting a quantum signal along that edge.  Lower decoherence costs are better.

Your goal is to design a routing protocol that can find the *k* most entanglement-preserving paths between any two nodes in the quantum network.

Specifically, given a source node `start`, a destination node `end`, and an integer `k`, your algorithm must:

1.  **Find *k* Distinct Paths:** Determine *k* distinct paths between `start` and `end`. Two paths are considered distinct if they do not share any edges. Node overlap is permitted, only edge disjointedness matters.
2.  **Minimize Total Decoherence:** For each path, calculate the total decoherence cost by summing the weights of the edges in the path.
3.  **Handle Node Failures:** The network is prone to node failures. You will be given a set of failing node `broken_nodes` dynamically. Your algorithm must avoid these failing nodes when computing the k best paths.
4.  **Prioritize Shortest Paths:** Among paths with similar decoherence costs, prioritize those with fewer hops (edges).
5.  **Return Sorted Paths:** Return a vector of the *k* paths, sorted primarily by their total decoherence cost (ascending) and secondarily by their number of hops (ascending). Each path should be represented as a vector of node indices, starting with `start` and ending with `end`.

**Input:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples `(u, v, w)` representing the network topology, where:
    *   `u` and `v` are integers representing the node indices connected by the edge (0 <= u, v < n).
    *   `w` is an integer representing the decoherence cost of the edge (1 <= w <= 100).
*   `start`: An integer representing the source node (0 <= start < n).
*   `end`: An integer representing the destination node (0 <= end < n).
*   `k`: An integer representing the number of paths to find (1 <= k <= 10).
*   `broken_nodes`: A `HashSet<Integer>` representing the currently broken nodes in the system.

**Output:**

*   A vector of vectors of integers, where each inner vector represents a path (list of node indices) from `start` to `end`. The paths should be sorted as described above. If fewer than *k* distinct paths exist, return all available paths. If no paths exist, return an empty vector.

**Constraints:**

*   2 <= `n` <= 50
*   1 <= `edges.length` <= 200
*   0 <= `start`, `end` < `n`
*   1 <= `k` <= 10
*   The graph may not be complete, but it is guaranteed to be connected when removing broken nodes.
*   Self-loops (edges from a node to itself) are not allowed.
*   Multiple edges between the same pair of nodes are not allowed.
*   The nodes indices start from 0.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 15), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 20), (2, 3, 10), (3, 4, 5)]
start = 0
end = 4
k = 2
broken_nodes = {2}

Output: [[0, 1, 3, 4]]

Explanation:
Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (Decoherence Cost: 10 + 20 + 5 = 35, Hops: 3)

Because node 2 is broken, we cannot use it. So there is only one available path.
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must correctly identify distinct paths and minimize decoherence cost.
*   Efficiency: The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints, and avoid infinite loops.
*   Edge Disjointedness: Paths must be edge-disjoint.
*   Handling broken nodes: Paths must not contain broken nodes.

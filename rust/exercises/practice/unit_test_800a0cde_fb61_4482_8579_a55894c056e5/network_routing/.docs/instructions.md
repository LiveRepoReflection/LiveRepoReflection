## Question: Optimized Network Routing

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing algorithm for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, uniquely identified by integers from `0` to `N-1`.  The network topology is dynamic, meaning connections between nodes can appear and disappear over time. You are given a stream of connection updates and routing queries.

Each connection update is represented as a tuple `(u, v, w)`, indicating that a bidirectional link with weight `w` (a positive integer) is established between node `u` and node `v`. If the link already exists, its weight is updated to the new value `w`. A tuple `(u, v, -1)` indicates the removal of the link between `u` and `v`.

Each routing query is represented as a tuple `(start, end, max_hops)`. Your algorithm must find the minimum total weight path from node `start` to node `end` using at most `max_hops`. If no such path exists, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100,000`
*   `1 <= number of connection updates <= 100,000`
*   `1 <= number of routing queries <= 100,000`
*   `0 <= u, v < N`
*   `1 <= w <= 1000`
*   `0 <= start, end < N`
*   `1 <= max_hops <= 20`

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution must efficiently handle a large number of connection updates and routing queries. Naive algorithms like repeatedly running Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford for each query will likely time out.
*   Consider data structures and algorithms that can adapt to changes in the network topology without requiring complete recomputation for every query.

**Input:**

The input consists of:

1.  An integer `N`, representing the number of nodes in the network.
2.  A vector of connection update tuples `updates`: `Vec<(usize, usize, i32)>`.
3.  A vector of routing query tuples `queries`: `Vec<(usize, usize, usize)>`.

**Output:**

A vector of integers, where the i-th integer represents the minimum total weight path for the i-th query, or `-1` if no such path exists.

**Example:**

```
N = 5
updates = [
    (0, 1, 2),
    (1, 2, 3),
    (0, 2, 6),
    (2, 3, 4),
    (3, 4, 5)
]
queries = [
    (0, 3, 3),
    (0, 4, 5),
    (1, 4, 2)
]
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[9, 14, -1]
```

**Explanation:**

*   Query (0, 3, 3): The optimal path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 with a total weight of 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
*   Query (0, 4, 5): The optimal path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 with a total weight of 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.
*   Query (1, 4, 2): There is no path from 1 to 4 with at most 2 hops. Thus, return -1.

## Problem: Decentralized Transaction Validator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a decentralized validator for a financial transaction network. This network consists of `N` nodes, each holding a partial view of the transactions occurring within the network. Due to network latency and potential malicious actors, these views may not be perfectly consistent or complete.

Your goal is to implement a validation algorithm that allows each node to independently determine the validity of a specific transaction, given its local view and leveraging information from other nodes in a fault-tolerant manner.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Transaction Representation:** A transaction is represented as a struct containing:
    *   `transaction_id`: A unique UUID identifying the transaction.
    *   `sender_account`: The account initiating the transaction (String).
    *   `recipient_account`: The receiving account (String).
    *   `amount`: The amount of funds transferred (u64).
    *   `timestamp`: The time the transaction was initiated (u64, Unix timestamp).
    *   `signature`: A cryptographic signature of the transaction data, signed by the sender's private key (String).

2.  **Node Data:** Each node maintains the following information:
    *   `node_id`: A unique UUID identifying the node.
    *   `transaction_log`: A vector of transactions observed by the node. Transactions are **not necessarily** ordered by timestamp, and may be incomplete.
    *   `known_nodes`: A list of other node IDs in the network.

3.  **Validation Criteria:** A transaction is considered valid if it meets the following criteria:
    *   **Syntactic Validity:** The transaction structure is well-formed. The signature can be verified against the transaction data and the sender's public key. (Assume a helper function `verify_signature(transaction: &Transaction) -> bool` is available.)
    *   **Sufficient Funds:** The sender has sufficient funds to cover the transaction amount *at the time of the transaction.*  This is the most challenging part. Nodes may not have complete transaction history.
    *   **No Double Spending:**  The transaction doesn't represent a double-spending attempt by the sender. This means there are no other conflicting transactions (same sender, earlier timestamp) that would invalidate this transaction.  Again, local transaction logs may be incomplete.

4.  **Distributed Consensus:** To address the incomplete view of each node, you will implement a gossip-based protocol. Each node can query other nodes in `known_nodes` for their transaction logs *related to the sender_account*. Due to potential network partitions, query responses might not always be available.  You are allowed to define a custom message structure for these queries/responses.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The validation process should be resilient to malicious nodes providing incorrect or incomplete transaction logs. Your solution should handle these scenarios gracefully.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement a function `validate_transaction(node: &Node, transaction: &Transaction) -> bool` that returns `true` if the transaction is considered valid by the node, and `false` otherwise.

*   Your solution should minimize network traffic and processing overhead. Aim for a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

*   Your solution must handle potential inconsistencies in transaction timestamps. The system cannot rely on accurate clocks across all nodes.

*   You can assume that you have functions for:
    *   `verify_signature(transaction: &Transaction) -> bool`
    *   `get_sender_public_key(sender_account: &str) -> Result<String, Error>`  // Returns the public key associated with an account.  Returns an error if the account doesn't exist.

*   You **cannot** assume any central authority or trusted third party.

*   You **cannot** modify existing transactions or introduce new transactions to "correct" the ledger. Your job is only to *validate* existing transactions.

*   **Optimization is critical.**  The network may process a very large number of transactions.  Think about how to limit the number of network requests and local computations.

**Constraints:**

*   `N` (number of nodes) can be up to 1000.
*   The number of transactions in a single node's `transaction_log` can be up to 10,000.
*   The transaction network can be highly unreliable, with potential message loss and malicious nodes.
*   The maximum time allowed for `validate_transaction` to execute on a single node is 1 second.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism to detect and penalize malicious nodes (e.g., by reducing their influence in the validation process).
*   Explore techniques to improve the accuracy of the validation process in the presence of network partitions.
*   Implement caching to reduce redundant network requests.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, data structures, and algorithms. Good luck!

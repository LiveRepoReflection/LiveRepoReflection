Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, incorporating elements of advanced data structures, optimization, and real-world simulation.

**Problem Title:**  Autonomous Drone Delivery Network Optimization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and optimizing the delivery routes for an autonomous drone delivery network operating within a densely populated urban environment.  The city is represented as a grid-based map.  Key locations within the city include:

*   **Delivery Hubs:**  These are locations where drones are initially stationed and where they return to recharge. Each hub has a limited number of drones available.
*   **Customer Locations:** These are locations where customers have placed orders that need to be delivered. Each customer location has a specific delivery deadline and a package weight.
*   **Charging Stations:**  Located throughout the city, allowing drones to extend their range. Drones can only charge at these stations. Charging time is proportional to the amount of charge needed.

Your goal is to minimize the total delivery time (sum of all delivery times for all customer orders) while adhering to the following constraints:

1.  **Drone Capacity:** Each drone has a maximum carrying capacity (weight). No drone can exceed this weight limit.
2.  **Battery Life:** Each drone has a limited battery life represented by a maximum flight time. Drones must return to a charging station or hub before their battery is depleted. Flying between grid locations consumes a fixed amount of battery. Charging consumes time, but replenishes battery.
3.  **Delivery Deadlines:** Each customer order has a specific delivery deadline.  Failure to meet a deadline incurs a significant penalty (which is *not* factored into the total delivery time you are trying to minimize, but is used for correctness validation).
4.  **Obstacles:** Certain grid locations are designated as obstacles (buildings, restricted airspace) and cannot be traversed by drones.
5.  **Drone Speed:** Drones have a fixed speed (distance per unit time) when flying.
6.  **Charging Time:** Charging time at a charging station is proportional to the amount of charge needed to reach full battery capacity.
7.  **Multiple Hubs:** Multiple delivery hubs exist, each with a limited number of drones. You must intelligently decide which hub to dispatch drones from to serve which customers.
8.  **Drone Replenishment:** A hub will not allow dispatching more drones than it has available.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in a structured format (details omitted for now, but imagine a well-defined JSON or similar). It will include:

*   A grid-based map of the city, indicating the location of delivery hubs (including drone counts at each hub), customer locations (including delivery deadlines and package weights), charging stations, and obstacles.
*   Drone specifications: maximum carrying capacity, maximum flight time, flight speed, charging rate.
*   The cost (time) of traversing between adjacent grid locations.

**Output:**

The output should be a detailed delivery schedule for each drone, including:

*   Drone ID.
*   Starting Delivery Hub.
*   A sequence of actions (fly to customer, charge at station, return to hub) with timestamps and locations.
*   Total delivery time for that drone.
*   A flag indicating whether all delivery deadlines were met.

**Constraints:**

*   The city grid size can be up to 100x100.
*   The number of delivery hubs can be up to 10.
*   The number of customer locations can be up to 100.
*   The number of charging stations can be up to 20.
*   You must minimize the *total* delivery time across *all* drones.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient; naive approaches will likely time out.  Consider the algorithmic complexity of your solution.
*   Solutions that fail to deliver all packages before their deadline will be penalized and considered incorrect.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** The primary criterion is whether the solution meets all delivery deadlines and adheres to all constraints (drone capacity, battery life, etc.).
*   **Total Delivery Time:**  The solution with the lowest total delivery time across all drones will be ranked higher.
*   **Efficiency:** Solutions that run within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 minutes) will be preferred.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using graph algorithms to find optimal routes (e.g., A*, Dijkstra's).
*   Explore dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to handle the complex constraints.
*   Develop a robust simulation to validate your delivery schedules before submission.
*   Think about how to efficiently handle the drone capacity and battery constraints within your search algorithm.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge, data structure expertise, and careful optimization to achieve a high score. Good luck!

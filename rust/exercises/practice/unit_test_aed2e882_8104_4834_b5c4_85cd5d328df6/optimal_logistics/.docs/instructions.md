Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult and require sophisticated solutions:

**Project Name:** `OptimalLogistics`

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are building a logistics platform for a massive, distributed network of warehouses.  This platform needs to handle delivery requests efficiently, considering various constraints and optimizing for cost.

You are given a directed graph representing the warehouse network. Each warehouse is a node in the graph, and each directed edge represents a possible transportation route between two warehouses.  Each edge has associated with it:

*   **Transportation Cost:** The cost (in currency units) to transport one unit of goods along this route.
*   **Capacity:**  The maximum number of units of goods that can be transported along this route within a given timeframe.
*   **Transit Time:** The time (in hours) it takes to transport goods along this route.

You are also given a set of delivery requests. Each request specifies:

*   **Origin Warehouse:** The warehouse where the goods originate.
*   **Destination Warehouse:** The warehouse where the goods need to be delivered.
*   **Quantity:** The number of units of goods to be delivered.
*   **Deadline:** The latest time (in hours from the start) that the goods can arrive at the destination warehouse.

Your task is to write a program that determines the *minimum total transportation cost* to fulfill all delivery requests, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity Constraints:** The amount of goods transported along any edge cannot exceed the edge's capacity.
2.  **Deadline Constraints:**  The goods for each request must arrive at the destination warehouse before or at the deadline.
3.  **Whole Units:** Only whole units of goods can be transported (you cannot split units).
4.  **Simultaneous Transport:** Goods can be transported simultaneously along multiple routes. The program should calculate the total cost for all units transported.

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided as structured data. Assume you have access to the following data structures in Rust:

```rust
struct Edge {
    from: usize, // Index of the origin warehouse
    to: usize,   // Index of the destination warehouse
    cost: u32,   // Cost per unit
    capacity: u32, // Max units
    time: u32,   // Transit time in hours
}

struct DeliveryRequest {
    origin: usize,      // Index of the origin warehouse
    destination: usize, // Index of the destination warehouse
    quantity: u32,    // Number of units to deliver
    deadline: u32,    // Deadline in hours
}

struct Network {
    num_warehouses: usize,
    edges: Vec<Edge>,
    requests: Vec<DeliveryRequest>,
}

```

**Output:**

Your function should return an `Option<u64>` representing the minimum total transportation cost to fulfill all delivery requests. If it's impossible to fulfill all requests within the constraints, return `None`. The return type is `u64` because the total cost can potentially be very large.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of warehouses can be up to 100.
*   The number of edges can be up to 500.
*   The number of delivery requests can be up to 20.
*   `cost`, `capacity`, `quantity`, `time`, and `deadline` are all non-negative integers.
*   All warehouse indices are valid (within the range `0..num_warehouses`).
*   Multiple edges can exist between the same pair of warehouses.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be computationally efficient. A brute-force approach will likely time out. Consider algorithms for finding shortest paths, maximum flows, or linear programming techniques (though implementing a full linear programming solver is not expected; efficient approximation or specific solver use is preferable).  The most efficient algorithm will pass, algorithms with lower efficiency will time out.
*   Memory usage should be reasonable.

**Edge Cases:**

*   No possible routes between the origin and destination for a request.
*   Insufficient capacity along routes to fulfill a request.
*   A request's deadline is impossible to meet due to long transit times.
*   Empty network (no warehouses or edges).
*   Requests with zero quantity.

This question requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful handling of constraints.  It presents a significant challenge even for experienced programmers. Good luck.

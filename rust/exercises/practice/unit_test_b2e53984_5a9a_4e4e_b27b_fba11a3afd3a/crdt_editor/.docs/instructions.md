Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be as difficult as a LeetCode Hard problem.

## Project Title

**Decentralized Collaborative Document Editor with CRDTs**

## Question Description

You are tasked with building the core synchronization logic for a decentralized collaborative document editor.  Imagine a system where multiple users can simultaneously edit the same document, and changes are propagated between them without a central server mediating every operation.  To achieve this, you will implement a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) to manage document state.

Specifically, you will be implementing a **List CRDT** using the **operation-based** approach with **insert** and **delete** operations.  Each character in the document will be associated with a unique identifier (a globally unique ID, or GUID). The document's state is represented by a list of these GUIDs, in the order they appear in the document. Insert operations specify the GUID of the character to be inserted, the GUID of the character it should be inserted *after*, and the character itself. Delete operations specify the GUID of the character to be deleted.

Here's a breakdown of the requirements:

1.  **Unique Identifiers:**  Implement a mechanism to generate unique identifiers (GUIDs). These must be sortable (lexicographically) to determine the order of characters inserted at the same position. You can use a UUID library, but you need to ensure sortability based on generation time and a replica ID. Consider the performance implications of different UUID versions.

2.  **Operation Representation:** Define Rust structs to represent the `Insert` and `Delete` operations.  Each operation must include all the necessary information to be applied correctly, even in the presence of concurrent operations. Insert should include the guid of the inserting character, the guid of the charater it is inserted after, and the character itself.

3.  **CRDT State:**  Represent the document state as a `Vec` of character GUIDs in their current order.  You also need a data structure (e.g., a `HashMap`) to store the actual characters associated with each GUID.

4.  **Operation Application:**  Implement functions to apply `Insert` and `Delete` operations to the CRDT state.  These functions must handle concurrent insertions and deletions correctly.  Consider that insertions could happen at the same spot.

5.  **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a conflict resolution strategy. Since operations are not guaranteed to arrive in any particular order, you must be able to handle out-of-order arrivals. Insertions at the same position should be resolved based on the GUIDs. Deletions should "win" against insertions, i.e., if a character is deleted, any pending insertions for that character should be discarded.

6.  **State Convergence:** Ensure that if all replicas apply the same set of operations (in any order), they will eventually converge to the same document state.

7.  **Document Representation:**  Provide a function to reconstruct the document content (a `String`) from the CRDT state.

8.  **Efficiency:**  The solution must be efficient in terms of both time and memory. Consider the performance implications of data structure choices and algorithmic complexity, especially when handling large documents with many concurrent operations.  Avoid unnecessary copying of data.  Benchmark your solution with a variety of operation sequences.

9.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. Return appropriate errors when operations are invalid (e.g., inserting after a non-existent character).

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must be thread-safe.  Multiple threads might be applying operations concurrently.  Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`) to protect shared data.
*   Minimize the use of external crates. Standard library features should be preferred. Using UUID crate is an exception.
*   The solution should be well-documented.  Explain the design choices and the rationale behind the conflict resolution strategy.
*   Focus on correctness, efficiency, and readability.

This problem requires a deep understanding of CRDTs, concurrent programming in Rust, and data structure design.  It also involves careful consideration of edge cases and potential performance bottlenecks. Good luck!

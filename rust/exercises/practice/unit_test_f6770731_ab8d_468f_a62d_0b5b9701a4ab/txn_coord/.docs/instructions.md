Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar in difficulty to a LeetCode Hard problem.

### Project Name

distributed-transaction-manager

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified distributed transaction manager. This system will coordinate transactions across multiple independent services.  The goal is to ensure **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability (ACID)** properties for transactions spanning these services, even in the face of potential failures.

Specifically, you need to implement the core logic for a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**System Architecture:**

Imagine you have a central transaction manager (the service you'll be building) and several resource managers (external services, which you don't implement). Each resource manager can perform operations related to a specific resource (e.g., a database).

**Transaction Flow:**

1.  **Initiation:** A client initiates a transaction by sending a request to the transaction manager. The request includes a list of operations to be performed on different resource managers. Each operation is identified by a unique ID.
2.  **Phase 1 (Prepare):** The transaction manager sends a "prepare" message to each resource manager involved in the transaction.  Each resource manager attempts to perform its assigned operation tentatively.
    *   If a resource manager can successfully prepare (e.g., reserve resources, stage changes), it responds with a "vote commit" message.
    *   If a resource manager cannot prepare (e.g., insufficient resources, validation failure), it responds with a "vote abort" message.
3.  **Phase 2 (Commit/Abort):**
    *   If the transaction manager receives "vote commit" from *all* participating resource managers, it sends a "commit" message to each of them.  The resource managers then permanently apply their changes.
    *   If the transaction manager receives *any* "vote abort" message, or if any resource manager fails to respond within a specified timeout, it sends an "abort" message to all resource managers. The resource managers then undo any tentative changes they made.
4.  **Completion:** The transaction manager notifies the client of the transaction's success (commit) or failure (abort).

**Your Task:**

Implement the transaction manager's core logic. You need to handle:

*   Receiving transaction requests.
*   Coordinating the 2PC protocol: sending "prepare," "commit," and "abort" messages to resource managers.
*   Handling responses (votes) from resource managers.
*   Managing timeouts: If a resource manager doesn't respond within a timeout period, the transaction should be aborted.
*   Maintaining transaction state: Track which resource managers are involved in each transaction, their votes, and the overall transaction status (preparing, committing, aborting, committed, aborted).
*   Concurrency: Handle multiple concurrent transactions efficiently.
*   Crash recovery: Implement a mechanism to recover the transaction manager's state after a crash. This will involve logging transaction events (start, prepare, vote, commit, abort) to persistent storage. On restart, the transaction manager should replay the log to reconstruct its state and resume any in-progress transactions. For example, a transaction stuck in the "preparing" state should be aborted after recovery.

**Constraints:**

*   **Resource Manager Interaction:** You *do not* need to implement the actual resource managers. Instead, you can simulate their behavior. You'll be provided with an interface (trait) that defines how the transaction manager interacts with the resource managers. You should design your solution to work with this interface.
*   **Concurrency:** The transaction manager must be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions.
*   **Performance:** The transaction manager should minimize latency and maximize throughput.
*   **Durability:** All transaction events must be logged to persistent storage before being acted upon. This ensures that the transaction manager can recover from crashes without losing data.  Assume a simple file-based logging mechanism is sufficient.
*   **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors gracefully, such as network failures, resource manager crashes, and logging errors.
*   **Timeout:** Implement a configurable timeout mechanism for resource manager responses.

**Input:**

*   A stream of transaction requests. Each request specifies a unique transaction ID and a list of operations to be performed on different resource managers.

**Output:**

*   For each transaction, the transaction manager should notify the client of the transaction's outcome (commit or abort).
*   The transaction manager should also maintain a log of all transaction events.

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Structures:**  Choose appropriate data structures to efficiently store and manage transaction state, resource manager information, and logs.
*   **Concurrency Control:**  Use appropriate concurrency primitives (e.g., mutexes, channels, atomic variables) to ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions.
*   **Logging:** Design a logging format that is efficient and easy to parse.
*   **Testing:**  Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of your transaction manager.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and error handling. It also requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithms to achieve optimal performance.  Good luck!

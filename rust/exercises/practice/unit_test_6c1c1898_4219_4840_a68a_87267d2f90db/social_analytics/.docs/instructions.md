## Question: Decentralized Social Network Analytics

You are tasked with building a system to analyze a large, decentralized social network. This network has the following characteristics:

*   **Nodes:** Represent users. Each user has a unique ID (a 64-bit unsigned integer).
*   **Edges:** Represent connections between users (friendships, follows, etc.). Connections are bidirectional (if A is connected to B, B is connected to A).
*   **Decentralization:** The network data is sharded across multiple servers. Each server holds a subset of the users and their connections. A single user's connections might be spread across multiple servers, but a single user is *only* present on a single server.
*   **Dynamic:** Users can join, leave, and form/break connections frequently.
*   **Scale:** The network is massive, with billions of users and connections. The number of servers is also large (hundreds or thousands).

Your goal is to implement a system that can efficiently answer the following types of analytical queries:

1.  **Degree Centrality:** Given a user ID, find the number of connections (neighbors) that user has in the entire network.

2.  **Mutual Friends:** Given two user IDs, find the number of mutual friends (shared neighbors) they have in the entire network.

3.  **k-Hop Neighbors:** Given a user ID and an integer *k*, find the number of users that are reachable from the given user within *k* hops (connections).

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Distributed Computation:** Your solution must leverage the distributed nature of the data.  Avoid collecting all the network data onto a single machine for processing.
*   **Low Latency:** Queries should be answered as quickly as possible. Aim for sub-second response times for most queries, even with a large network.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to server failures. If a server goes down, the system should still be able to answer queries, potentially with slightly degraded performance.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle increasing numbers of users, connections, and servers without significant performance degradation.
*   **Data Consistency:**  While real-time strong consistency is not strictly required (due to the dynamic nature of social networks), eventual consistency is a must.  The system should converge to a correct state over time.  Avoid scenarios where query results are wildly inaccurate.
*   **Memory Efficiency:**  Minimize the memory footprint of each server. Given the massive scale, memory usage can quickly become a bottleneck.
*   **Optimized Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures for storing and querying the network data on each server.
*   **No External Libraries:** You can only use the standard rust library.

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Partitioning:** How will you distribute the users and their connections across the servers? Consider different partitioning strategies (e.g., hash-based, range-based) and their implications for query performance and data consistency.
*   **Communication:** How will the servers communicate with each other to answer queries that require data from multiple servers? Consider different communication patterns (e.g., point-to-point, broadcast, gossip protocols) and their trade-offs.
*   **Caching:** How can caching be used to improve query performance? Consider caching frequently accessed data, query results, or intermediate results.
*   **Concurrency:**  How can you leverage concurrency within each server to improve query throughput?
*   **Trade-offs:** Be prepared to discuss the trade-offs between different design choices, such as query latency, data consistency, memory usage, and fault tolerance.
*   **Serialization:** Choose an efficient serialization mechanism for inter-server communication.

This is a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, graph algorithms, and data structures. Your solution should be well-reasoned, efficient, and scalable. Good luck!

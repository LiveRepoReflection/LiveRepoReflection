Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test advanced data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and handling complex constraints.

**Problem Title:** Optimal Highway Network Design

**Problem Description:**

The nation of "Rustlandia" is planning a new highway network to connect its major cities. Rustlandia consists of *N* cities (numbered 1 to *N*) and *M* existing roads.  The government wants to ensure that every city can reach every other city using the highway network.  However, building new highways is expensive.

You are given the following:

*   *N*: The number of cities in Rustlandia.
*   *M*: The number of existing roads.
*   A list of *M* roads, where each road is represented as a tuple *(u, v, c)*, where *u* and *v* are the city numbers connected by the road, and *c* is the cost to traverse that road (bi-directional).
*   *K*: The maximum number of new highways the government is willing to build.
*   A list of potential highway locations. Each potential highway is represented as a tuple *(x, y, w)*, where *x* and *y* are the city numbers the highway would connect, and *w* is the cost to build that highway.

Your task is to determine the *minimum total cost* required to connect all cities in Rustlandia, given that you can build at most *K* new highways from the provided list of potential highways.  The total cost includes the cost of traversing the existing roads and the cost of building the new highways you choose.

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

```
N M K
u1 v1 c1
u2 v2 c2
...
uM vM cM
K
x1 y1 w1
x2 y2 w2
...
xL yL wL
```

Where *L* is the number of potential highways available.

**Output Format:**

Print a single integer representing the minimum total cost to connect all cities. If it is impossible to connect all cities even with *K* new highways, print -1.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= *N* <= 1000
*   0 <= *M* <= *N* \* (*N* - 1) / 2
*   0 <= *K* <= 10
*   1 <= *u*, *v*, *x*, *y* <= *N*
*   1 <= *c*, *w* <= 10<sup>6</sup>
*   There can be multiple roads between two cities, in this case, choose the minimum cost.
*   The number of potential highways, *L*, can be up to *N* \* (*N* - 1) / 2.
*   The graph can be disconnected initially.

**Example:**

```
4 2 1
1 2 10
3 4 5
1
2 3 20
```

In this example, there are 4 cities, 2 existing roads, and the government can build at most 1 new highway. The cities 1 and 2 are connected with a cost of 10, and cities 3 and 4 are connected with a cost of 5.  Adding the highway between cities 2 and 3 with a cost of 20 connects all cities with a total cost of 10 + 5 + 20 = 35.

**Difficulty Considerations:**

*   **Finding Connected Components:** Initially identifying the connected components of the graph formed by existing roads.
*   **Optimal Highway Selection:** Deciding which *K* highways to build to minimize the overall cost. This involves considering all possible combinations of highways, making it exponential without optimization.
*   **Graph Algorithms:**  Utilizing efficient graph algorithms such as Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) *after* selecting the highways.
*   **Handling Disconnected Graphs:** Correctly handling cases where even with *K* highways, the graph remains disconnected.
*   **Optimization:** Optimizing the selection of highways to avoid unnecessary computations.  Consider using bit manipulation or dynamic programming techniques to efficiently explore the possible highway combinations.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handling cases with no existing roads, *K* = 0, or when all cities are already connected.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, graph algorithms, and optimization techniques to achieve an efficient solution. The constraint on *K* limits the search space but still requires a smart approach to find the optimal combination of highways. Good luck!

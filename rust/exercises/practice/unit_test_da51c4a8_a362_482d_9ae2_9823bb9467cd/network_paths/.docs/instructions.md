Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be comparable to a LeetCode "Hard" level question, incorporating elements of advanced data structures, optimization, and real-world considerations.

**Problem: Decentralized Network Routing Optimization**

**Description:**

You are designing the routing algorithm for a decentralized network composed of nodes with limited computational power and bandwidth. Each node maintains a partial view of the network topology, represented as a weighted graph where nodes are represented by unique integer IDs, edges represent communication links, and edge weights represent the estimated latency of that link. Due to the decentralized nature, no single node has complete knowledge of the entire network.

Your task is to implement a distributed algorithm that efficiently finds the "k" shortest paths between any two nodes in the network, given the limited information available at each node. The algorithm must be robust to network changes (link failures, node additions/removals) and adapt quickly to maintain accurate routing information.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Data Representation:**

    *   Each node maintains a `RoutingTable`, which is a weighted directed graph representing its local view of the network. The graph should be efficiently implemented to support fast lookups for neighbors and edge weights.  Consider using adjacency lists or matrices as appropriate, but justify your choice in terms of performance for the expected network size and density.
    *   The `RoutingTable` should include a timestamp for each entry, indicating when the information was last updated. This is crucial for handling network changes.
    *  Nodes are represented by `u32` IDs.

2.  **Algorithm Requirements:**

    *   Implement a variant of the Yen's k-shortest paths algorithm, adapted for a distributed environment.  Since each node only has a local view, the algorithm will need to be iterative and exchange information with neighboring nodes.
    *   Nodes periodically exchange their `RoutingTable` information with their direct neighbors. The frequency of this exchange should be configurable.  Consider how to efficiently represent and transmit only the *changes* in the routing table since the last exchange (delta updates).
    *   When a node receives a `RoutingTable` update from a neighbor, it must integrate this information into its own `RoutingTable`.  You need to implement a conflict resolution strategy to handle cases where information from different neighbors conflicts (e.g., different latency estimates for the same link).  A simple strategy is to trust the most recently received information.
    *   Implement a function `find_k_shortest_paths(start_node: u32, end_node: u32, k: usize)` that, based on the node's current `RoutingTable`, estimates the "k" shortest paths between `start_node` and `end_node`. The algorithm should return a `Vec<Vec<u32>>` where each inner `Vec<u32>` represents a path (list of node IDs). The paths should be sorted by their estimated total latency (shortest first).
    *   Due to the incomplete information, the returned paths might not be truly the *actual* k-shortest paths in the global network, but they should be the best estimate based on the local view.

3.  **Constraints:**

    *   **Memory Limit:** Each node has a limited amount of memory to store its `RoutingTable`. The `RoutingTable` should only store information about nodes and links that are reachable within a certain number of hops (e.g., 3-5 hops) from the current node. Beyond this limit, the information should be discarded to prevent the `RoutingTable` from growing too large. This limits the view of each node.
    *   **Computational Complexity:** The `find_k_shortest_paths` function must have a reasonable time complexity.  A naive implementation of Yen's algorithm can be very slow. You need to optimize the algorithm to make it feasible for real-time routing decisions.  Consider using heuristics and pruning techniques to reduce the search space.
    *   **Network Dynamics:** The network topology can change at any time. Links can fail, nodes can be added or removed. Your algorithm must be able to adapt to these changes. You can simulate these changes by periodically injecting link failures or node additions into the network.  The algorithm should converge to a reasonable routing solution after a change within a reasonable time frame.
    *   **Bandwidth Limit:** Minimize the amount of data exchanged between nodes when updating `RoutingTable` information.

4.  **Optimization Goals:**

    *   **Path Accuracy:** Maximize the accuracy of the `find_k_shortest_paths` function, given the limited information available.  This can be measured by comparing the estimated path latency with the actual path latency in a simulated full network.
    *   **Convergence Speed:** Minimize the time it takes for the network to converge to a stable routing solution after a topology change.
    *   **Memory Footprint:** Minimize the memory used by each node to store its `RoutingTable`.

5.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Return appropriate errors (using `Result`) if a path cannot be found.
    *   Gracefully handle invalid node IDs in the requests.

**Note:**

The focus of this problem is not to implement a perfectly accurate routing algorithm, but to design a practical and efficient algorithm that works well under the given constraints.  The emphasis is on making intelligent trade-offs between accuracy, performance, and memory usage. The problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and distributed systems concepts.

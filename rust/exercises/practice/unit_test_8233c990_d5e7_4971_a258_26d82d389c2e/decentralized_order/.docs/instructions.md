## Problem: Decentralized Transaction Ordering

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing a system for ordering transactions in a decentralized network. Imagine a blockchain-like environment where transactions are broadcasted to multiple nodes, but there's no central authority to dictate the order in which they should be processed. Your goal is to implement a mechanism that allows nodes to collectively agree on a canonical transaction order, even in the presence of network delays, node failures, and potentially malicious actors.

Specifically, you are given a stream of incoming transactions. Each transaction is represented by a unique ID (a `u64` integer) and a timestamp (also a `u64` integer, representing milliseconds since the epoch). Your system should maintain a consistent, globally agreed-upon order of these transactions.

To achieve this, you will implement a distributed consensus algorithm based on a simplified version of Paxos.  Each node in the network maintains a local view of the transactions and their order.  The nodes communicate with each other to propose and accept transaction orderings.

Your system must adhere to the following rules:

1.  **Agreement:** All non-faulty nodes must eventually agree on the same transaction order.
2.  **Validity:** The agreed-upon transaction order must be a valid permutation of the received transactions.
3.  **Eventual Ordering:**  Every transaction received by a non-faulty node must eventually be included in the agreed-upon order.
4.  **Timestamp Consistency:**  The agreed-upon order must respect the timestamps of the transactions as much as possible.  Specifically, if transaction A has a timestamp significantly earlier than transaction B, A should precede B in the final order.  "Significantly earlier" is defined as at least `THRESHOLD_MILLISECONDS` (defined below).  However, achieving perfect timestamp order is not always possible due to network delays and clock skew, so some deviation is acceptable.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should tolerate a certain number of node failures (assume less than one-third of the nodes can fail or be malicious).
6.  **Efficiency:**  The system should strive to minimize communication overhead and processing time.  The consensus algorithm should converge to a final order relatively quickly.

**Implementation Details:**

You are provided with a basic `Node` struct and some helper functions. You need to implement the core logic for transaction ordering using a Paxos-like consensus algorithm.

**Requirements:**

1.  Implement a `Node` struct with appropriate fields to maintain its local state, including:
    *   A local list of received transactions (ID and timestamp).
    *   A proposed transaction order.
    *   A mechanism for communicating with other nodes (simulated through function calls).
    *   Any other data structures needed for your chosen consensus algorithm.

2.  Implement the core functions for the Paxos-like consensus algorithm:
    *   `propose_order()`:  Generates a proposed transaction order based on the node's current knowledge.  Consider using the timestamps as a primary sorting key, but allow for some flexibility to handle out-of-order arrivals.
    *   `receive_proposal(proposal: Vec<u64>, proposer_id: u32)`:  Handles incoming transaction order proposals from other nodes. The `proposal` is a `Vec<u64>` representing the transaction IDs in the proposed order.  The `proposer_id` is the ID of the node that sent the proposal.
    *   `accept_proposal(proposal: Vec<u64>)`: Handles a globally accepted transaction order proposal. This method should be called when the node determines that a proposal has reached consensus.
    *   `get_final_order()`: Returns the final, agreed-upon transaction order as a `Vec<u64>`.

3. Implement a simple communication mechanism by simulating message passing between nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The network consists of `N` nodes, where `N` is a constant (e.g., 5 or 7).
*   Node IDs are integers from 0 to `N-1`.
*   Transactions can arrive at different nodes in different orders and at different times.
*   There is a maximum number of transactions that the system will handle (e.g., 1000).
*   Network communication is unreliable.  Messages can be delayed, dropped, or reordered (but not corrupted). You may need to implement mechanisms to handle these issues (e.g., timeouts, retransmissions).
*   Some nodes may be faulty or malicious and can send arbitrary messages to disrupt the consensus process. Your algorithm should be resilient to these attacks.

**Optimization:**

*   Minimize the number of messages exchanged between nodes.
*   Reduce the time it takes for the system to reach consensus.
*   Optimize memory usage.

**Real-World Considerations:**

This problem simulates a simplified version of transaction ordering in a distributed ledger system.  Real-world systems need to handle much larger transaction volumes, more complex network topologies, and more sophisticated attacks.  Consider how your solution could be extended to address these challenges.

**Threshold:**

```rust
const THRESHOLD_MILLISECONDS: u64 = 500; // Consider timestamps differing by this much as "significantly earlier"
```

**Example:**

```rust
struct Transaction {
    id: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
}

struct Node {
    id: u32,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    // ... other fields for consensus
}

impl Node {
    fn new(id: u32) -> Self {
        Node {
            id,
            transactions: Vec::new(),
            // ... initialize other fields
        }
    }

    fn propose_order(&self) -> Vec<u64> {
        // ... implement logic to generate a proposed order
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn receive_proposal(&mut self, proposal: Vec<u64>, proposer_id: u32) {
        // ... implement logic to handle incoming proposals
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn accept_proposal(&mut self, proposal: Vec<u64>) {
        // ... implement logic to handle accepted proposals
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn get_final_order(&self) -> Vec<u64> {
        // ... return the final, agreed-upon transaction order
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn receive_transaction(&mut self, transaction: Transaction) {
      self.transactions.push(transaction);
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Simulate a decentralized network of nodes
    let num_nodes = 5;
    let mut nodes: Vec<Node> = (0..num_nodes).map(|i| Node::new(i as u32)).collect();

    // Simulate transactions arriving at different nodes
    let transactions = vec![
        Transaction { id: 1, timestamp: 100 },
        Transaction { id: 2, timestamp: 200 },
        Transaction { id: 3, timestamp: 150 },
        Transaction { id: 4, timestamp: 300 },
        Transaction { id: 5, timestamp: 250 },
    ];

    nodes[0].receive_transaction(transactions[0]);
    nodes[1].receive_transaction(transactions[0]);
    nodes[2].receive_transaction(transactions[1]);
    nodes[3].receive_transaction(transactions[2]);
    nodes[4].receive_transaction(transactions[3]);
    nodes[0].receive_transaction(transactions[4]);

    // ... Simulate the consensus process (propose, receive_proposal, accept_proposal)

    // Verify that all nodes agree on the same final order
    let final_order = nodes[0].get_final_order();
    for node in &nodes {
        assert_eq!(node.get_final_order(), final_order);
    }

    println!("Final Transaction Order: {:?}", final_order);
}
```

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed consensus algorithms and the ability to implement a complex system with multiple interacting components. Good luck!

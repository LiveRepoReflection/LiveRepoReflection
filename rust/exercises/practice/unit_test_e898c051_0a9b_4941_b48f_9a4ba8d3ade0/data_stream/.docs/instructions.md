### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed system for aggregating numerical data from a large number of edge devices in real-time.  These edge devices are resource-constrained and have intermittent network connectivity.  They generate time-series data in the form of (timestamp, value) pairs, where `timestamp` is a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds since the epoch) and `value` is a floating-point number.

The system comprises the following components:

1.  **Edge Devices:**  Generate and transmit data.  They can buffer a limited number of data points if the network is temporarily unavailable.

2.  **Aggregation Nodes:**  These nodes receive data from edge devices, perform local aggregation, and forward aggregated results to a central server.  Aggregation nodes are geographically distributed to minimize network latency. Each aggregation node is responsible for a subset of edge devices.

3.  **Central Server:**  Receives aggregated data from multiple aggregation nodes and computes global aggregates (min, max, average, standard deviation) over a sliding time window.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **Data Format:**  Data transmitted between components should be efficient (consider binary serialization).

*   **Time Windowing:** The central server needs to calculate aggregates over a sliding time window of `W` seconds. The window slides in `S` second increments. For example, if `W` is 60 seconds and `S` is 10 seconds, the server calculates aggregates for `[0, 60], [10, 70], [20, 80]`, and so on.

*   **Error Handling:**  The system must be resilient to data loss due to network issues or device failures.  Implement mechanisms to detect and potentially mitigate data loss. You do not need to implement retry mechanisms in the edge devices themselves.

*   **Resource Constraints:** Edge devices have limited memory and processing power. The aggregation nodes have more resources but are still subject to memory limitations. The central server has relatively abundant resources, but must process data from a potentially vast number of aggregation nodes.

*   **Real-time Aggregation:** The central server must provide up-to-date aggregates with minimal latency.

*   **Approximate Aggregation:** Due to the distributed nature of the system and the possibility of data loss, it's acceptable to provide *approximate* aggregates, especially for standard deviation. You should aim for reasonable accuracy.

**Your Task:**

Implement the aggregation nodes and the central server in Rust. Focus on the following:

1.  **Aggregation Node:**
    *   Receives data from edge devices. You can simulate this with a function that takes a vector of `(timestamp, value)` pairs as input.
    *   Performs local aggregation (min, max, sum, count) within a sliding window. Choose an appropriate data structure to store the data.
    *   Periodically sends aggregated data to the central server.
    *   Handles potential data loss by implementing a sequence number-based mechanism.

2.  **Central Server:**
    *   Receives aggregated data from multiple aggregation nodes.
    *   Maintains a sliding time window.
    *   Computes global aggregates (min, max, average, standard deviation) over the window.
    *   Implements a robust and efficient data structure for storing and processing time-series data. Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and query performance.
    *   Handles out-of-order data and potential data loss from aggregation nodes.
    *   Provides an API to query the current aggregates.

**Constraints:**

*   Assume edge devices send data at varying rates, but on average, each device sends one data point per second.
*   The number of edge devices connected to each aggregation node can vary significantly (e.g., 10 to 1000).
*   The total number of edge devices in the system can be very large (e.g., millions).
*   The time window `W` can range from 60 seconds to 3600 seconds.
*   The sliding interval `S` can range from 1 second to 60 seconds.
*   Optimize for minimal latency and memory usage.  Consider using techniques like data compression or sampling to reduce memory footprint.
*   Consider potential concurrency issues and use appropriate synchronization mechanisms.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and handling data loss more accurately (e.g., using Bloom filters).
*   Explore different approximate aggregation algorithms for standard deviation.
*   Implement dynamic scaling of aggregation nodes based on the number of connected edge devices.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, system design, and concurrency. Good luck!

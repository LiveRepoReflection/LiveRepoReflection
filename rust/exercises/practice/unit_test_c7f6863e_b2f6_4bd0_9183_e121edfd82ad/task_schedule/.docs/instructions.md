## Question: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduler for a complex system. The system consists of a set of `N` tasks, each with the following properties:

*   **ID:** A unique integer identifier from `0` to `N-1`.
*   **Execution Time:** An integer representing the time required to complete the task.
*   **Deadline:** An integer representing the time by which the task must be completed.
*   **Dependencies:** A list of task IDs that must be completed before this task can start.

The scheduler can execute only one task at a time. The objective is to find a schedule that completes all tasks before their respective deadlines, while minimizing the **maximum lateness** of any task. The lateness of a task is defined as `max(0, completion_time - deadline)`. Your goal is to minimize the maximum lateness across all tasks.

**Input:**

The input is a list of tasks, where each task is represented by a tuple:

`(execution_time, deadline, dependencies)`

where:

*   `execution_time` is an integer.
*   `deadline` is an integer.
*   `dependencies` is a list of integers representing the IDs of tasks that must be completed before this task can start.

**Example:**

```
tasks = [
    (5, 10, []),  # Task 0: Execution time 5, Deadline 10, No dependencies
    (3, 12, [0]), # Task 1: Execution time 3, Deadline 12, Depends on Task 0
    (6, 15, [0]), # Task 2: Execution time 6, Deadline 15, Depends on Task 0
    (4, 20, [1, 2]), # Task 3: Execution time 4, Deadline 20, Depends on Tasks 1 and 2
]
```

**Output:**

Your function should return the minimum possible maximum lateness achievable by any valid schedule. If it is impossible to complete all tasks before their deadlines, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of tasks)
*   `1 <= execution_time <= 100` for each task.
*   `1 <= deadline <= 10000` for each task.
*   Dependencies are valid task IDs within the range `0` to `N-1`.
*   The dependency graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   The scheduler starts at time 0.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Your solution should be able to handle the maximum input size (`N = 1000`) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize your solution.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty task list.
*   Tasks with no dependencies.
*   Tasks with circular dependencies (the input will **not** contain these, but your algorithm should not crash if they are present and detect they are impossible to schedule).
*   Cases where it's impossible to meet all deadlines.

**Hints:**

*   Consider topological sorting to determine a valid task order based on dependencies.
*   Think about how to explore different scheduling possibilities and find the one that minimizes the maximum lateness.  Dynamic programming or branch and bound techniques might be helpful.
*   Carefully handle dependencies to ensure that a task is not scheduled before its dependencies are completed.
*   Pay attention to integer overflow issues when calculating completion times and lateness.

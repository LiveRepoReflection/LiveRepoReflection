## The Quantum Circuit Optimizer

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building an optimizer for quantum circuits. A quantum circuit consists of a sequence of quantum gates acting on qubits. The goal is to reorder and combine gates to minimize the total number of gates in the circuit, thus reducing the execution time and error rate on a quantum computer.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Quantum Circuit Representation:** The input circuit will be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node in the DAG represents a quantum gate. An edge from gate A to gate B indicates that gate A must be executed before gate B. Each gate acts on one or more specific qubits.

2.  **Gate Types:** You will be dealing with a limited set of gate types, each represented by a unique integer identifier. Each gate has a fixed number of input qubits. For this problem, you will need to consider the following types of gate:
    *   `Hadamard (H)`: Single qubit gate. Represented by ID 1.
    *   `CNOT`: Two-qubit gate (control, target). Represented by ID 2.
    *   `T gate`: Single qubit gate. Represented by ID 3.

3.  **Commutation Rules:** Two gates can be swapped (commuted) in the circuit if:
    *   They do not have a dependency edge between them in the DAG.
    *   They operate on different sets of qubits. Formally, if gate A acts on qubits {q1, q2} and gate B acts on qubits {q3, q4}, they can be swapped if {q1, q2} ∩ {q3, q4} = ∅.

4.  **Gate Fusion:** Certain sequences of gates can be fused into a single gate. For this problem, you need to implement the following fusion rule:
    *   Two consecutive `Hadamard (H)` gates on the same qubit can be removed (since H\*H = Identity).

5.  **Optimization Goal:** Your task is to implement an algorithm that takes the initial quantum circuit (DAG) as input and returns an optimized circuit (DAG) that satisfies the following conditions:
    *   The optimized circuit must perform the same logical operation as the original circuit.
    *   The total number of gates in the optimized circuit must be minimized.

**Input Format:**

The input will be provided as follows:

*   `num_qubits`: An integer representing the number of qubits in the quantum circuit.
*   `num_gates`: An integer representing the number of gates in the initial circuit.
*   `gates`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a gate and has the following format: `(gate_id, qubit_indices)`.  `gate_id` is the integer identifier for the gate type (1, 2, or 3). `qubit_indices` is a list of integers representing the qubit indices that the gate acts on.  For example, `(1, [0])` represents a Hadamard gate on qubit 0, and `(2, [0, 1])` represents a CNOT gate with control qubit 0 and target qubit 1. The order of the gates in this list defines the initial sequence of gates.
*   `dependencies`: A list of tuples, where each tuple `(i, j)` represents a dependency edge in the DAG, indicating that gate `i` must be executed before gate `j`. Indices `i` and `j` refer to the position of the gate in the `gates` list (0-indexed).

**Output Format:**

The output should be a list of tuples, representing the optimized quantum circuit, in the same format as the input `gates`. The order of gates in the output list represents the optimized sequence of gates.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_qubits <= 16`
*   `1 <= num_gates <= 1000`
*   `0 <= qubit_indices[i] < num_qubits`
*   The input DAG will always be acyclic.
*   The same qubit can be used as both control and target in a CNOT gate.
*   The solution must be efficient. Solutions with time complexity O(n^3) or higher, where n is the number of gates, will likely time out.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
num_qubits = 2
num_gates = 4
gates = [(1, [0]), (1, [0]), (2, [0, 1]), (1, [1])]  // H on qubit 0, H on qubit 0, CNOT(0,1), H on qubit 1
dependencies = [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2,3)] // Gate 0 -> Gate 2, Gate 1 -> Gate 2, Gate 2 -> Gate 3
```

**Possible Output:**

```
[(2, [0, 1]), (1, [1])] // CNOT(0,1), H on qubit 1
```

**Explanation:**

The two consecutive Hadamard gates on qubit 0 cancel each other out. The remaining gates can be executed in the same order as before (CNOT and then H on qubit 1) while respecting the dependencies.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on the correctness and the degree of optimization achieved. Test cases will be designed to evaluate both the functionality of the commutation and fusion rules and the ability to minimize the number of gates effectively. Time and memory limits will be enforced.

Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Rust coding problem. Here it is:

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a distributed transaction coordinator in Rust.  This coordinator must manage transactions across a cluster of `n` worker nodes (where `n` can be a large number, like 1000 or more). Each worker node stores data, and a transaction involves operations (read and write) on potentially multiple worker nodes.

The coordinator is responsible for ensuring atomicity (all operations succeed or none do), consistency, isolation (transactions don't interfere with each other), and durability (ACID properties).

**Simplified Data Model:**

Each worker node stores key-value pairs, where both keys and values are strings.

**Transactions:**

A transaction consists of a sequence of operations. Each operation is directed at a specific worker node and can be one of the following:

*   `Read(key)`: Reads the value associated with the given key from the specified worker node. Returns the value if the key exists; otherwise, returns `None`.
*   `Write(key, value)`: Writes the given value to the given key on the specified worker node. If the key exists, its value is overwritten; otherwise, a new key-value pair is created.
*   `Delete(key)`: Deletes the key-value pair associated with the given key from the specified worker node.

**Coordinator Requirements:**

1.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):** Implement the two-phase commit protocol to ensure atomicity across the worker nodes involved in a transaction. This involves a "prepare" phase where the coordinator asks all involved workers to prepare to commit, and a "commit" or "abort" phase where the coordinator tells all involved workers to either commit or rollback.
2.  **Concurrency:** The coordinator must handle multiple concurrent transactions. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., Mutexes, RwLocks, or Channels) to prevent data races and ensure isolation.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:**  Simulate worker node failures. Introduce a mechanism for worker nodes to randomly fail (become unresponsive) during the prepare or commit/abort phases. The coordinator should handle these failures gracefully, ensuring that the transaction eventually either commits or aborts consistently across the remaining available nodes. Implement a timeout mechanism; if a worker doesn't respond within a specified time, the coordinator should consider it failed.
4.  **Logging:** Implement a simple logging mechanism for the coordinator. The log should record transaction start, prepare, commit, abort, and any node failures. This log is critical for recovery after a coordinator failure (which you don't need to implement, but your design should consider it).
5.  **Optimization:**  Minimize the number of network round trips between the coordinator and the worker nodes. Consider batching operations or using asynchronous communication where possible.
6.  **Unique Transaction ID:** Every transaction should have a unique ID.

**Worker Node Requirements (Simulated):**

You don't need to implement actual network communication. Instead, simulate worker nodes as in-memory data structures (e.g., `HashMap`) managed by the coordinator.  Each simulated worker node must:

1.  Receive prepare requests from the coordinator.  In the "prepare" phase, the worker should tentatively apply the changes from the transaction to a staging area (e.g., a shadow `HashMap`).  It should then signal to the coordinator whether it is ready to commit or if it needs to abort (e.g., due to resource constraints).
2.  Receive commit or abort requests from the coordinator.  If the worker receives a commit request, it should move the changes from the staging area to its main data store.  If it receives an abort request, it should discard the changes from the staging area.
3. Simulate random failures.

**Input:**

The input to your program will be a series of transaction descriptions. Each transaction description includes a unique transaction ID and a list of operations. Each operation specifies the target worker node, the operation type (Read, Write, Delete), and any necessary key and value data.

**Output:**

The output of your program should be a log of the coordinator's actions, including:

*   Transaction start events
*   Prepare requests sent to worker nodes
*   Responses from worker nodes during the prepare phase
*   Commit or abort decisions
*   Commit or abort requests sent to worker nodes
*   Confirmation from worker nodes of commit or abort completion
*   Any detected worker node failures
*   Final transaction outcome (committed or aborted)

**Constraints:**

*   Ensure thread safety and prevent data races.
*   Optimize for performance.  Consider the impact of your design on the overall transaction throughput.
*   Handle a large number of concurrent transactions and worker nodes.
*   Implement a reasonable timeout mechanism for handling unresponsive worker nodes.
*   Simulate worker node failures realistically.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the coordinator correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure ACID properties?
*   Concurrency: Does the coordinator handle multiple concurrent transactions without data races or deadlocks?
*   Fault Tolerance: Does the coordinator handle worker node failures gracefully and consistently?
*   Performance: Is the coordinator optimized for performance and throughput?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Logging: Does the coordinator provide sufficient logging information for debugging and recovery?

This problem requires a solid understanding of concurrency, distributed systems principles, and Rust's concurrency features. Good luck!

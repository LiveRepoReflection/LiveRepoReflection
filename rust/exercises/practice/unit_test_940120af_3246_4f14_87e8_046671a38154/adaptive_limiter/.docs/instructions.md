Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test advanced skills and push the boundaries of typical LeetCode Hard difficulty.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Rate Limiter with Adaptive Throttling

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service. This service is responsible for protecting a critical API endpoint from abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation across a large number of clients.  The service must handle a massive volume of requests (millions per second) from potentially millions of unique clients, with stringent latency requirements (sub-millisecond average).

The system should support the following features:

*   **Global Rate Limiting:** Enforce a maximum number of requests per second across all clients accessing the API endpoint.

*   **Per-Client Rate Limiting:**  Enforce a maximum number of requests per second for each individual client.

*   **Adaptive Throttling:**  Dynamically adjust the rate limits based on the current system load and resource availability. When the system is under heavy load (e.g., high CPU utilization, memory pressure, or network congestion), the rate limits should be reduced to prevent overload.  When the system is operating comfortably, the rate limits can be relaxed to allow higher throughput.

*   **Distributed Architecture:**  The rate limiter service must be deployed across multiple nodes (machines) to handle the high volume of requests and provide fault tolerance.  Clients should be able to access the service through a load balancer, and the rate limiting decisions must be consistent across all nodes.

*   **Near Real-Time Monitoring:** Provide metrics on the current request rate, number of throttled requests, system load, and other relevant performance indicators. The data should be updated frequently.

**Input:**

The rate limiter service receives a stream of request tokens. Each token represents a request to the protected API endpoint. A request token contains the following information:

*   `client_id`: A unique identifier for the client making the request (String).
*   `timestamp`: The time at which the request was made (Unix timestamp in milliseconds - i64).

**Output:**

For each request token, the rate limiter service should return a boolean value:

*   `true`:  The request is allowed to proceed.
*   `false`: The request is rate limited (throttled) and should be rejected.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Scalability:** The service must be able to handle a massive number of requests per second (millions).
*   **Low Latency:** The rate limiting decision should be made with minimal latency (sub-millisecond average).
*   **Consistency:**  The rate limiting decisions must be consistent across all nodes in the distributed system.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  The service should continue to operate correctly even if some nodes fail.
*   **Accuracy:** The rate limits should be enforced as accurately as possible.
*   **Memory Usage:** The service should use memory efficiently, especially considering the large number of clients.
*   **Adaptive Throttling Algorithm:** The adaptive throttling algorithm should be responsive to changes in system load but avoid excessive oscillations. It should also prevent starvation of any particular client.  Justify your algorithm selection and its configuration.
*   **Concurrency:** The service must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests correctly.
*   **Configuration:** The global and per-client rate limits should be configurable and dynamically adjustable without restarting the service.
*   **Testing:** You must provide comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to demonstrate the correctness and performance of your solution.  Consider testing scenarios such as sudden bursts of traffic, node failures, and dynamic configuration changes.

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Structures:** Consider using appropriate data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of rate limiting information (e.g., hash maps, concurrent data structures).  Think carefully about the trade-offs between memory usage, lookup speed, and thread safety.
*   **Synchronization:** Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, atomic variables, channels) to ensure thread safety in the distributed environment.
*   **Distributed Consensus:**  You may need to use a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure consistency of the rate limits across all nodes. Consider using a distributed key-value store (e.g., Redis, etcd) to manage shared state.
*   **System Load Monitoring:**  You'll need a mechanism to monitor system load on each node (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O).  Consider using system monitoring libraries or APIs.
*   **Algorithm Choices**: Think about token bucket algorithm, leaky bucket algorithm, or other rate limiting algorithms.
*   **Trade-offs**: Analyze and discuss the trade-offs between different design choices, such as consistency vs. availability, memory usage vs. performance, and accuracy vs. complexity.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, data structures, and algorithms. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Rust coding problem.

**Project Name:** `OptimalResourceAllocation`

**Question Description:**

Imagine you are building a cloud service that allows users to run computationally intensive tasks. The service has a cluster of heterogeneous machines, each with different CPU, memory, and network bandwidth capacities.  Users submit tasks that require specific amounts of these resources.

Your task is to design an efficient resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the number of tasks that can be run concurrently on the cluster, subject to the resource constraints of each machine.

**Input:**

*   `machines`: A `Vec` of `Machine` structs. Each `Machine` struct has the following fields:
    *   `id`: A unique `u32` identifier for the machine.
    *   `cpu`: A `u32` representing the CPU capacity of the machine.
    *   `memory`: A `u32` representing the memory capacity of the machine.
    *   `network`: A `u32` representing the network bandwidth capacity of the machine.
*   `tasks`: A `Vec` of `Task` structs. Each `Task` struct has the following fields:
    *   `id`: A unique `u32` identifier for the task.
    *   `cpu`: A `u32` representing the CPU required by the task.
    *   `memory`: A `u32` representing the memory required by the task.
    *   `network`: A `u32` representing the network bandwidth required by the task.

**Output:**

A `Vec` of `Allocation` structs, representing the optimal allocation of tasks to machines. An `Allocation` struct has the following fields:

*   `task_id`: The `u32` identifier of the task.
*   `machine_id`: The `u32` identifier of the machine the task is allocated to.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Maximization:** The primary goal is to maximize the number of allocated tasks.
2.  **Resource Constraints:** A task can only be allocated to a machine if the machine has sufficient CPU, memory, and network bandwidth to satisfy the task's requirements.
3.  **No Over-allocation:** A machine cannot be allocated more resources than it has available.
4.  **Single Allocation:** Each task can only be allocated to at most one machine.
5.  **Heterogeneous Machines:** Machines have different resource capacities.
6.  **Task Dependencies:**  The tasks have dependencies. Task `A` depends on Task `B`, so `A` can only be scheduled if `B` is scheduled. This dependency information is represented in a `HashMap<u32, Vec<u32>>` where the key is a task ID, and the value is a `Vec` of task IDs that depend on the key task. If a task is not in the `HashMap` it does not have any dependencies.
7.  **Optimization:** The algorithm should be reasonably efficient.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out for larger inputs.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance. The test input size could be up to 100 machines and 500 tasks.
8.  **Fairness (Bonus):**  While not strictly required for correctness, solutions that attempt to distribute the load somewhat evenly across the machines will be viewed more favorably (but correctness and maximization take precedence). This is intentionally vague.
9.  **Error Handling:** If no allocation is possible (e.g., no machine can satisfy any task), return an empty `Vec`.

**Example:**

(Simplified for brevity - real test cases will be much larger and more complex)

```rust
struct Machine { id: u32, cpu: u32, memory: u32, network: u32 }
struct Task { id: u32, cpu: u32, memory: u32, network: u32 }
struct Allocation { task_id: u32, machine_id: u32 }

// Example input
let machines = vec![
    Machine { id: 1, cpu: 4, memory: 8, network: 10 },
    Machine { id: 2, cpu: 2, memory: 4, network: 5 },
];
let tasks = vec![
    Task { id: 1, cpu: 1, memory: 2, network: 3 },
    Task { id: 2, cpu: 2, memory: 4, network: 4 },
    Task { id: 3, cpu: 1, memory: 1, network: 1 },
];
let dependencies: HashMap<u32, Vec<u32>> = HashMap::new(); // No dependencies for this example
```

**Challenge:**  The difficulty lies in finding a good balance between exploration and exploitation when searching for the optimal allocation.  The dependencies add an extra layer of complexity.  Efficiently managing resource constraints and task dependencies while maximizing task allocation will be crucial.

This problem requires a solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

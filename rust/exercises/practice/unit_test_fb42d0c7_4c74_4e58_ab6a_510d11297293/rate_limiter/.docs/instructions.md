## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service. This service should limit the number of requests a user can make to a specific API within a given time window. The service must be highly available, scalable, and efficient.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Rate Limiting:** The service must be able to limit requests based on:
    *   User ID (e.g., API key, user identifier)
    *   API endpoint (e.g., `/resource1`, `/resource2`)
    *   Time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour)

2.  **Distributed Operation:** The service should be deployed across multiple nodes to handle a high volume of requests.

3.  **Consistency:** All nodes in the distributed system must enforce the rate limits consistently.  A user should not be able to bypass the rate limit by sending requests to different nodes.

4.  **High Availability:** The service should continue to function even if some nodes fail.

5.  **Scalability:** The service should be able to handle an increasing number of users and requests without significant performance degradation.

6.  **Efficiency:** The service must be able to process requests quickly with minimal latency.

7.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The service should support the ability to dynamically update rate limit configurations (e.g., changing the rate limit for a specific API endpoint) without service downtime.

8.  **Concurrency:** The service must handle concurrent requests from multiple users efficiently.

9.  **Real-world Practical Scenarios:** Consider scenarios such as flash crowds, DDoS attacks, and unexpected traffic spikes. How would your rate limiter service handle these situations?

**Constraints:**

*   Minimize latency for each request. Rate limiting should not significantly impact the response time of the protected APIs.
*   Optimize memory usage. The service should not consume excessive memory, especially when handling a large number of users.
*   Ensure fault tolerance. The system should be able to recover quickly from failures.
*   Consider the cost of infrastructure and resources. The solution should be cost-effective.

**Specific Tasks:**

*   Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for storing and managing rate limit information. Consider trade-offs between memory usage, lookup speed, and update frequency.
*   Design a distributed architecture that addresses the requirements of consistency, high availability, and scalability. Consider different approaches such as centralized, decentralized, or hybrid architectures.
*   Implement a mechanism for synchronizing rate limit information across multiple nodes. Consider techniques such as distributed counters, consensus algorithms, or gossip protocols.
*   Implement a mechanism for dynamically updating rate limit configurations.
*   Implement a mechanism to handle edge cases and error conditions.

**Bonus (Optional):**

*   Implement a user interface or API for managing rate limit configurations.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting capabilities to track the performance and health of the rate limiter service.
*   Explore different rate-limiting algorithms, such as token bucket, leaky bucket, or fixed window counters, and analyze their trade-offs.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, data structures, and algorithms. Successful solutions will demonstrate a clear understanding of the trade-offs involved in designing a highly available, scalable, and efficient rate limiter service. Good luck!

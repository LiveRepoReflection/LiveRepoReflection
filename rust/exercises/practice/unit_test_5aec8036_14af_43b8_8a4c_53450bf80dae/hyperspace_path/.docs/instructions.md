Okay, I'm ready to generate a challenging Rust coding problem. Here it is:

### Project Name

`IntergalacticPathfinder`

### Question Description

The Intergalactic Federation is developing a new hyperspace network to connect its member planets. As a pathfinder engineer, your task is to design an efficient algorithm to determine the shortest (fastest) path between any two planets in the network, considering the complexities of hyperspace travel.

The hyperspace network can be represented as a weighted, directed graph. Each planet is a node in the graph. Edges represent hyperspace routes between planets. The weight of each edge represents the time (in standard galactic units) it takes to traverse that route.

However, there's a catch! Hyperspace routes are not static. Due to fluctuating wormhole activity, the travel time of each route varies over time. You are given a log of these fluctuations.

**Specifics:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** The initial hyperspace network is provided as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple `(start_planet, end_planet, base_travel_time)`. `start_planet` and `end_planet` are strings representing the names of the planets, and `base_travel_time` is an integer representing the travel time when there are no wormhole fluctuations.

2.  **Wormhole Fluctuations:** A stream of wormhole fluctuation events is provided as a list of tuples, `(timestamp, start_planet, end_planet, time_delta)`. `timestamp` is an integer representing the time of the event. `start_planet` and `end_planet` identify the route affected. `time_delta` is an integer representing the change in travel time for that route *starting* at the given timestamp. The travel time remains modified until another fluctuation event affects that route. If `time_delta` is negative, it reduces the travel time, and if positive, it increases the travel time. The travel time of a route can never be negative. If a `time_delta` would cause the travel time to be negative, the travel time is capped at zero.

3.  **Pathfinding Queries:** You need to implement a function that, given the network, the fluctuation log, a start planet, an end planet, and a query time `t`, finds the shortest (fastest) path between the start and end planets at time `t`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of planets (nodes) can be up to 1000.
*   The number of initial routes (edges) can be up to 5000.
*   The number of wormhole fluctuation events can be up to 10000.
*   Travel times (base and delta) are non-negative integers and fit within a 32-bit integer.
*   Timestamps are non-negative integers and fit within a 64-bit integer.
*   The graph might not be fully connected. If there's no path between the start and end planets, return `None`.
*   The solution must be computationally efficient. Naive approaches that recompute shortest paths for every query will likely time out. Consider how to efficiently update the graph based on the fluctuations relevant to a specific query time.
*   You should prioritize routes with lower travel times.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement the `find_shortest_path` function that takes the initial network, the fluctuation log, a start planet, an end planet, and a query time `t` as input, and returns an `Option<u32>` representing the shortest path time. Return `None` if no path exists.
*   Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize pathfinding and fluctuation processing.
*   Handle edge cases gracefully, such as no path existing, no fluctuations, or fluctuations affecting non-existent routes.
*   Your solution should be memory-efficient as well.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (like Dijkstra or A*), efficient data structures for managing the fluctuations (potentially a sorted data structure or a segment tree), and careful handling of edge cases. It's designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem, designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard in difficulty.

### Project Name

`AutonomousNavigation`

### Question Description

You are tasked with developing a navigation system for an autonomous vehicle operating within a complex, dynamic environment. The environment is represented as a weighted directed graph, where nodes represent locations and edges represent traversable paths between locations. Each edge has an associated cost representing the time taken to traverse that path.

However, the environment is not static. Some paths might become temporarily blocked, and new paths may appear dynamically. You will receive a continuous stream of events that modify the graph structure. These events can be of the following types:

1.  **Block Path:** An existing path between two locations becomes temporarily unavailable (e.g., due to an obstacle). You are given the source and destination nodes of the blocked path, and the duration (in time units) for which it will remain blocked.

2.  **Unblock Path:** A previously blocked path becomes available again. You are given the source and destination nodes of the unblocked path.

3.  **Add Path:** A new path is added between two locations. You are given the source and destination nodes of the new path and the cost (traversal time) associated with it.

4.  **Remove Path:** An existing path between two locations is permanently removed from the graph. You are given the source and destination nodes of the path to remove.

5.  **Navigation Request:** Given a starting location, a destination location, and a time window (start time, end time), find the *cheapest* (least traversal time) path from the start to the destination within the specified time window.  The vehicle *must* arrive at the destination no later than the `end time`, and the vehicle must *begin* its journey no earlier than the `start time`. Note that the vehicle can wait at any node, but waiting contributes to the total travel time, which must be less than the provided time window. The path must be valid considering any path blockages currently active during the traversal.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can contain up to 10,000 nodes.
*   The number of edges can be up to 50,000.
*   The cost of each edge is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
*   The time window for navigation requests can be large (up to 1,000,000 time units).
*   The number of events can be up to 100,000. Events are provided in chronological order.
*   You must efficiently handle a large number of navigation requests interleaved with graph modification events.
*   Multiple paths can exist between any two nodes, each with a possibly different cost.
*   It is possible that no valid path exists for a given navigation request within the time window.
*   Nodes are identified by unique integer IDs.

**Requirements:**

Implement a `NavigationSystem` struct in Rust with the following methods:

*   `new(num_nodes: usize)`: Creates a new navigation system with the specified number of nodes. Initially, there are no edges in the graph.

*   `handle_event(event: Event)`: Processes an event modifying the graph or handling a navigation request.

*   The `Event` enum should have variants for `BlockPath`, `UnblockPath`, `AddPath`, `RemovePath`, and `NavigationRequest`, each containing the necessary data as described above.  The `NavigationRequest` event should include a field to store the result (the path cost or an indication that no path was found).

**Optimization:**

*   Your solution must be efficient in terms of both time and memory.
*   Consider the trade-offs between different graph traversal algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A\*) and data structures for representing the graph and blocked paths.
*   Pre-computation and caching strategies might be helpful but must be carefully managed to avoid excessive memory usage.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles to achieve optimal performance within the given constraints. It necessitates an understanding of graph algorithms, data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of blocked paths, and potentially caching or pre-computation techniques to speed up navigation requests. Good luck!

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter in Rust. Your rate limiter should control the number of requests a client can make to a service within a given time window, preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must function correctly across multiple instances of the service, ensuring consistent rate limiting even when requests are handled by different servers.

2.  **Configurable Time Window and Request Limit:** The rate limiter should allow configuration of the time window (e.g., 1 second, 1 minute, 1 hour) and the maximum number of requests allowed within that window.

3.  **Client Identification:** The rate limiter must be able to identify clients uniquely. You can assume that each client is identified by a unique string key (e.g., IP address, API key, user ID).

4.  **Atomic Operations:** Given the distributed nature of the system, you must use atomic operations to increment and check request counts to avoid race conditions.

5.  **Data Storage:** Implement the rate limiter using Redis as a distributed cache to store the request counts for each client.  Use a suitable Redis data structure to efficiently manage the rate limiting window.

6.  **Exceed Limit Handling:** When a client exceeds the rate limit, the rate limiter should return an appropriate error (e.g., `RateLimitExceeded`).

7.  **Resetting the Window:**  The request count should reset automatically at the end of the time window.  Consider how to achieve this efficiently in Redis.

8.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter must be highly efficient, with minimal overhead on request processing.  Aim for O(1) complexity for rate limiting checks.

9.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter should be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients without compromising accuracy or performance.

10. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle Redis connection errors, serialization/deserialization failures, and other potential issues.

11. **Customizable Rejection Strategy:** Provide a mechanism to customize the action taken when a request is rate limited. This can include simply rejecting the request, returning a specific error code, or enqueuing the request for later processing.

**Constraints:**

*   You are allowed to use any suitable Rust libraries for Redis interaction, concurrency, and error handling.
*   Focus on correctness, efficiency, and scalability.
*   Assume Redis is already running and accessible.

**Bonus (Optional):**

*   Implement a "leaky bucket" or "token bucket" algorithm for smoother rate limiting.
*   Add support for tiered rate limits (e.g., different rate limits for different types of clients).
*   Implement metrics and monitoring to track rate limiter performance and effectiveness.
*   Consider using asynchronous operations for Redis interaction to improve throughput.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, Redis, and Rust. The solution should be well-structured, efficient, and robust. Good luck!

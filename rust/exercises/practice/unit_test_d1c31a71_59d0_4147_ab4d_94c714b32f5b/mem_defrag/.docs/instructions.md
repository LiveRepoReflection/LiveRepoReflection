Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Rust coding problem suitable for a high-level programming competition. Here's the problem description:

### Project Name

`defragmentation`

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a sophisticated memory defragmentation algorithm.  Imagine a memory space divided into a large number of fixed-size blocks. Some blocks are occupied by processes (allocated), while others are free. The goal of defragmentation is to consolidate all the free blocks into a single contiguous region at the end of the memory space.

Specifically, you are given a `MemoryManager` struct representing the state of the memory. It contains the following:

- `capacity: usize`:  The total number of memory blocks.
- `allocations: Vec<Option<ProcessId>>`:  A vector representing the memory space. Each element in the vector corresponds to a memory block. If the element is `Some(process_id)`, the block is occupied by the process with the given `process_id`. If the element is `None`, the block is free.

```rust
type ProcessId = usize;

struct MemoryManager {
    capacity: usize,
    allocations: Vec<Option<ProcessId>>,
}
```

You need to implement a `defragment` method for the `MemoryManager` that rearranges the `allocations` vector *in-place* such that:

1.  All `Some(process_id)` blocks are grouped together at the beginning of the vector, maintaining their original relative order.
2.  All `None` blocks are grouped together at the end of the vector.
3.  The `capacity` of the `MemoryManager` remains unchanged.
4.  The solution must be *stable*. The original relative order of the allocated blocks must be preserved after defragmentation.
5.  The solution must be memory efficient. You are allowed to use a constant amount of extra memory, i.e. O(1) space complexity.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   `capacity` can be very large (up to 10<sup>9</sup>). However, `allocations.len()` will be less than or equal to `capacity`.
*   The `allocations` vector may be empty.
*   The `allocations` vector may be completely full (no free blocks).
*   The `allocations` vector may be completely empty (all free blocks).
*   There may be multiple processes occupying blocks. The same `process_id` may appear multiple times in the `allocations` vector.
*   The goal is to achieve the best possible time complexity.  A naive O(n<sup>2</sup>) solution will likely time out.  Aim for O(n) time complexity.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be as efficient as possible in terms of both time and space.  Solutions that are unnecessarily complex or inefficient will be penalized.
*   The `defragment` method should modify the `allocations` vector *in-place*. Creating a new vector and copying data is not allowed.

**Real-World Practical Scenario:**

This problem simulates a simplified version of memory defragmentation in operating systems.  Defragmentation is crucial for preventing memory fragmentation, which can lead to inefficient memory utilization and program crashes.

**System Design Aspects:**

Consider how this defragmentation routine would fit into a larger memory management system. How would it be triggered? What impact would it have on running processes?  (While these aspects are not directly part of the coding problem, thinking about them can help you design a more robust and efficient solution.)

**Example:**

```rust
let mut memory_manager = MemoryManager {
    capacity: 10,
    allocations: vec![Some(1), None, Some(2), None, Some(3), None, Some(4), None, Some(5), None],
};

memory_manager.defragment();

// After defragmentation, allocations should be:
// vec![Some(1), Some(2), Some(3), Some(4), Some(5), None, None, None, None, None]

assert_eq!(memory_manager.allocations, vec![Some(1), Some(2), Some(3), Some(4), Some(5), None, None, None, None, None]);

```

**Challenge:**

Implement the `defragment` method for the `MemoryManager` struct in Rust, adhering to all the constraints and optimization requirements.  Your solution will be judged on its correctness, efficiency, and code quality.

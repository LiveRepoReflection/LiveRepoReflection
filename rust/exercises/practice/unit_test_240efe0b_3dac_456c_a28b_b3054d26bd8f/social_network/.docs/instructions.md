Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

## Project Name

`Decentralized Social Network Graph`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building the core functionality for a decentralized social network.  Unlike traditional social networks that rely on a central server, this network uses a peer-to-peer architecture where user data and connections are distributed across many nodes.

Each node in the network represents a user and stores their profile information and a list of their direct connections (friends).  The network's scalability and resilience are paramount.  Therefore, you need to implement a system that efficiently handles user connections, profile retrieval, and most importantly, the discovery of paths between users within the network.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionalities:

1.  **User Representation:**  Each user is uniquely identified by a `u64` ID.  User profiles are simple structs containing a username (String) and a short bio (String).

2.  **Node Storage:**  Implement a thread-safe, in-memory data structure to represent the network. This structure should efficiently store user profiles and their connections. You must use `Arc<RwLock<...>>` to protect the data structure and allow concurrent read/write operations.

3.  **Connection Management:** Implement functions to:
    *   Add a new user to the network.
    *   Establish a connection (friendship) between two users.
    *   Remove a connection between two users.

4.  **Profile Retrieval:** Given a user ID, efficiently retrieve their profile information.

5.  **Pathfinding:** This is the core challenge.  Implement a function that, given two user IDs (source and destination), finds the shortest path between them in the social network.
    *   Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for pathfinding.
    *   The function should return an `Option<Vec<u64>>`, where `Vec<u64>` represents the sequence of user IDs forming the shortest path from the source to the destination. If no path exists, return `None`.
    *   **Optimization Requirement:** The pathfinding algorithm should be optimized for performance. Consider using appropriate data structures to avoid unnecessary allocations and lookups during the BFS traversal.  Large networks with millions of users are expected, so efficiency is crucial.  Avoid cloning data unnecessarily.

6. **Network Partition Handling**: The network is decentralized which means not all users are always online. When finding the shortest path, your algorithm should be able to handle the situation where some users in the ideal shortest path are offline and return the next best possible path if available. Assume that an offline user cannot be connected to. If all possible paths are broken because of offline users, return None.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   The network can contain millions of users.
*   User IDs are unique.
*   Connections are undirected (if A is a friend of B, then B is a friend of A).  Ensure this is maintained in your implementation.
*   Handle the case where the source and destination users are the same.
*   Handle the case where either the source or destination user does not exist in the network.
*   The network might contain disconnected components (islands of users with no connections to other islands).
*   Multiple shortest paths may exist; your algorithm can return any one of them.
*   Ensure your implementation is thread-safe and handles concurrent access correctly.
*   Avoid deadlocks.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a caching mechanism to speed up profile retrieval for frequently accessed users.
*   Implement a distributed locking mechanism to prevent race conditions when modifying connections in a highly concurrent environment. (This would be beyond the core requirement but demonstrates a deeper understanding of distributed systems).
*   Implement a function to recommend friends to a user based on their existing connections (e.g., "friends of friends").

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and concurrency, making it a challenging and sophisticated task. Good luck!

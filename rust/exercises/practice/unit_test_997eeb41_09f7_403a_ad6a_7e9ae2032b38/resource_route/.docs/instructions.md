Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question. It focuses on graph manipulation, pathfinding, and optimization within a resource-constrained environment.

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a routing algorithm for a distributed computing system. The system consists of `n` nodes, each with a limited amount of a specific resource (e.g., memory, CPU cores, specialized hardware).  Nodes are interconnected in a network represented by a directed graph.

**Problem Statement:**

Given:

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (nodes are numbered from `0` to `n-1`).
*   `resource_limits`: A `Vec<u64>` of length `n`, where `resource_limits[i]` represents the resource limit of node `i`.
*   `edges`: A `Vec<(usize, usize, u64)>` representing the directed edges in the network. Each tuple `(u, v, cost)` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with a traversal cost of `cost`.
*   `start_node`: The starting node for routing (an index between `0` and `n-1`).
*   `end_node`: The destination node for routing (an index between `0` and `n-1`).
*   `required_resource`: The amount of resource required to execute a task at the destination node.
*   `max_total_cost`: The maximum acceptable total traversal cost for the route.

Your goal is to find the **lowest possible resource usage** among all paths from `start_node` to `end_node` that satisfy the following conditions:

1.  **Reachability:** A path from `start_node` to `end_node` must exist.
2.  **Resource Availability:** The destination node (`end_node`) must have sufficient resources to accommodate the `required_resource`. In other words, `resource_limits[end_node] >= required_resource`.
3.  **Cost Constraint:** The total cost of the path (sum of edge costs) must be less than or equal to `max_total_cost`.
4.  **Resource Usage:** For each path that meets the reachability and cost constraints, calculate the maximum resource limit of any node visited along that path. Your task is to minimize this value.

If multiple paths exist that satisfy all conditions and have the same minimum resource usage, return the shortest path (fewest number of edges) among them.

If no path exists that meets all the conditions, return `None`.

**Output:**

Return an `Option<(u64, Vec<usize>)>`.

*   `Some((min_resource_usage, path))`, where `min_resource_usage` is the minimum resource usage as defined above, and `path` is a `Vec<usize>` representing the nodes in the optimal path from `start_node` to `end_node` (inclusive). If multiple paths meet all criteria and have the same resource usage and length, return any one of them.
*   `None` if no path satisfies all the conditions.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= start_node < n`
*   `0 <= end_node < n`
*   `0 <= resource_limits[i] <= 10^9`
*   `0 <= edges.len() <= 5000`
*   `0 <= u < n` (for each edge `(u, v, cost)`)
*   `0 <= v < n` (for each edge `(u, v, cost)`)
*   `0 <= cost <= 10^6` (for each edge `(u, v, cost)`)
*   `0 <= required_resource <= 10^9`
*   `0 <= max_total_cost <= 10^9`

**Example:**

```
n = 4
resource_limits = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];
edges = vec![(0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 10), (1, 3, 15), (2, 3, 5)];
start_node = 0
end_node = 3
required_resource = 25
max_total_cost = 30

// Expected Output: Some((30, vec![0, 2, 3]))
// Path 0 -> 1 -> 3 has cost 20 and resource usage max(10, 20, 40) = 40
// Path 0 -> 2 -> 3 has cost 15 and resource usage max(10, 30, 40) = 40.
// Resource Usage (max resource limit of the nodes visited) is 40.
// However, if we have resource_limits = vec![10, 50, 30, 40];
// The Path 0 -> 2 -> 3 has cost 15 and resource usage max(10, 30, 40) = 40.
// The Path 0 -> 1 -> 3 has cost 20 and resource usage max(10, 50, 40) = 50.
// The Optimal resource usage is now 40.

// If we have resource_limits = vec![10, 50, 30, 20];
// Path 0 -> 1 -> 3 has cost 20 and resource usage max(10, 50, 20) = 50
// Path 0 -> 2 -> 3 has cost 15, but it's not viable since resource_limits[end_node] = 20 < required_resource = 25.
// Now, no paths are viable, so return None.
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar pathfinding algorithm.
*   You'll need to adapt the algorithm to handle the resource constraints and optimize for resource usage.
*   Think about how to efficiently keep track of the resource usage for each path.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases, such as no path existing or the destination node not having enough resources.
*   The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle reasonably large graphs within the time limit.

This problem combines graph algorithms with resource management, requiring careful consideration of both correctness and efficiency. Good luck!

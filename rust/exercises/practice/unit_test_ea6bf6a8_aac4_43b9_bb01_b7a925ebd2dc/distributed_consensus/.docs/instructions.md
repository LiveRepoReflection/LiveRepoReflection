Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Rust coding problem. Here it is:

**Project Name:** `Distributed Consensus Simulator`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a simplified simulator for a distributed consensus algorithm.  Imagine you're implementing a core component of a system like Raft or Paxos, but without the full complexity of network handling, persistence, and leader election. Instead, you focus on the message passing and decision-making logic within a round of consensus.

Your simulator will consist of `N` nodes (where `N` is configurable). Each node maintains a state machine (simplified to just a single integer value). The goal is for all nodes to agree on a new state value, proposed by a client.

Here's how a single round of consensus should work (in your simulated environment):

1. **Proposal:** A client (external to the simulation) proposes a new integer value to be the next state. This proposal is initially sent to a designated "proposer" node (which can be node 0 for simplicity).

2. **Phase 1 (Prepare):** The proposer node sends a "Prepare" message to all other nodes. This message includes a proposal ID (a unique integer, incrementing with each new proposal from this proposer) and the proposed value.

3. **Phase 2 (Promise):**  Each node, upon receiving a "Prepare" message, must decide whether to "promise" to accept the proposal. A node promises to accept if the proposal ID is higher than any proposal ID it has previously promised to. If it promises, it sends a "Promise" message back to the proposer, including its current state value. If it rejects (because the proposal ID is too low), it does *not* send a message.

4. **Phase 3 (Accept):** The proposer node, upon receiving "Promise" messages from a majority of nodes (strictly more than N/2), chooses a value to propose for acceptance.  If any of the "Promise" messages included a non-default state value (i.e., a value from a previous accepted proposal), the proposer *must* choose the highest such value. Otherwise, it proposes the original client-proposed value. The proposer then sends "Accept" messages to all nodes, including the chosen value and the proposal ID.

5. **Phase 4 (Learn):** Each node, upon receiving an "Accept" message, checks if the proposal ID is higher than or equal to any proposal ID it has previously accepted.  If so, it updates its state to the accepted value and records the proposal ID. If not, it ignores the message.

**Your Task:**

Implement the core consensus logic for a *single round* of this algorithm.  You will be given:

*   A `struct` representing a Node, including fields for:
    *   Its ID (0 to N-1).
    *   Its current state (an integer).
    *   The highest proposal ID it has "promised" to.
    *   The highest proposal ID it has "accepted".
*   `enum`s representing the different message types (Prepare, Promise, Accept).
*   Functions to:
    *   Initialize the nodes.
    *   Send a message between nodes.
    *   Simulate the proposer receiving a client proposal.
    *   Process incoming messages at each node.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Correctness:**  The simulation *must* correctly implement the described consensus algorithm. All nodes that receive an "Accept" message with a valid proposal ID *must* update their state accordingly.  The algorithm should ensure that nodes eventually converge on the same state value, even if they start with different initial states.
*   **Concurrency:** The simulation must be thread-safe, as multiple messages might arrive concurrently at a node. Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Atomic*`) to protect shared state.
*   **Handling Stale Messages:** Nodes might receive messages out of order or from previous rounds. Your implementation must correctly handle these stale messages by checking proposal IDs and ignoring outdated proposals.
*   **Majority Quorum:** Ensure that the proposer only sends "Accept" messages if it has received "Promise" messages from a strict majority of nodes.
*   **Highest Proposed Value:** If the proposer receives "Promise" messages with existing state values from prior rounds, it *must* select the highest of those values as the proposed value for acceptance.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for unexpected situations (e.g., invalid message types, corrupted data).
*   **Performance:** While not the primary focus, strive for reasonable performance.  Avoid unnecessary copying of data and optimize critical sections of code.  Consider the trade-offs between different synchronization mechanisms.
*   **Generality:** Your implementation should work correctly for any number of nodes `N` greater than 1.

**Input:**

*   The number of nodes, `N` (an integer > 1).
*   A client-proposed value (an integer).
*   The initial state of each node (an array of integers of length `N`).

**Output:**

*   The final state of each node after the single round of consensus (an array of integers of length `N`).

**Rust Specific Challenges:**

*   **Ownership and Borrowing:** Carefully manage ownership and borrowing to avoid common Rust errors.
*   **Concurrency:**  Effectively use Rust's concurrency features to ensure thread safety and avoid data races.
*   **Error Handling:**  Use Rust's `Result` type for proper error propagation.
*   **Traits:**  You might consider using traits to define a common interface for message handling.

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed consensus, concurrency, and Rust's ownership model. It encourages careful design, robust error handling, and efficient use of synchronization primitives. It also has several edge cases and potential optimizations, making it a challenging and rewarding exercise. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test a programmer's knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques.

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a communication network. The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.  Each node represents a server.  The connections between servers are represented by a set of bidirectional links.  Each link has a latency associated with it, representing the time it takes for data to travel across that link. Your goal is to implement a system that can efficiently determine the lowest latency path between any two given nodes in the network, subject to dynamic network conditions and capacity constraints.

**Input:**

1.  `n: usize`: The number of nodes in the network.
2.  `initial_links: Vec<(usize, usize, u64, u64)>`: A vector of tuples representing the initial network links. Each tuple contains:
    *   `node1: usize`: The ID of the first node connected by the link.
    *   `node2: usize`: The ID of the second node connected by the link.
    *   `latency: u64`: The initial latency of the link.
    *   `capacity: u64`: The capacity of the link (maximum data it can handle per unit time).

3.  A series of queries and updates that must be processed in the order they are received. The queries and updates are represented as a `Vec<Command>`.

**Commands:**

The `Command` enum is defined as follows:

```rust
enum Command {
    FindRoute {
        start_node: usize,
        end_node: usize,
        data_size: u64,
    },
    UpdateLink {
        node1: usize,
        node2: usize,
        new_latency: u64,
        new_capacity: u64,
    },
    RemoveLink {
        node1: usize,
        node2: usize,
    },
    AddLink {
        node1: usize,
        node2: usize,
        latency: u64,
        capacity: u64,
    },
}
```

*   `FindRoute { start_node, end_node, data_size }`:  Find the path with the minimum *effective* latency between `start_node` and `end_node` that can accommodate `data_size`. The *effective* latency of a path is the sum of the latencies of the links in the path, *increased* if any link along the path is congested. A link is congested if the `data_size` exceeds its `capacity`. The latency increase due to congestion is calculated as `latency * (data_size / capacity)`. If `data_size` is not perfectly divisible, round up.
    *   If no path exists that can accommodate the data (even with congestion), return `None`.
    *   If a path exists, return `Some(total_effective_latency: u64)`.

*   `UpdateLink { node1, node2, new_latency, new_capacity }`: Update the latency and capacity of the link between `node1` and `node2`. If the link doesn't exist, it should be added.

*   `RemoveLink { node1, node2 }`: Remove the link between `node1` and `node2`.

*   `AddLink { node1, node2, latency, capacity }`: Add a new link between `node1` and `node2`.  If link exists, overwrite it.

**Output:**

Return a `Vec<Option<u64>>` containing the results of the `FindRoute` commands, in the order they appear in the input `commands` vector.  Each `Option<u64>` represents the minimum effective latency found for the corresponding route query.  `None` should be returned if no valid route exists.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10,000` (Number of nodes)
*   `0 <= node1, node2 < n` (Node IDs)
*   `1 <= latency, capacity, data_size <= 1,000,000,000` (Link properties and data size)
*   The network is initially connected.
*   The number of commands can be up to 10,000.
*   The graph is undirected; if a link (a, b) exists, it's the same as (b, a).
*   The same `FindRoute` command may be called multiple times.
*   All calculations (including intermediate ones) should fit within a `u64`.
*   For congestion calculation, rounding up division should be used:  `(data_size + capacity - 1) / capacity`.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle a large number of queries and updates within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).  Naive solutions (like repeatedly running Dijkstra's for each query) will likely time out.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures to represent the network and efficiently update link properties.
*   Consider pre-computing some information to speed up route finding, but keep in mind the cost of updates.

**Example (Illustrative):**

```rust
// Simplified example
let n = 4;
let initial_links = vec![
    (0, 1, 10, 100),
    (1, 2, 20, 50),
    (2, 3, 30, 25),
    (0, 3, 100, 10)
];

let commands = vec![
    Command::FindRoute { start_node: 0, end_node: 3, data_size: 60 },
    Command::UpdateLink { node1: 2, node2: 3, new_latency: 15, new_capacity: 50 },
    Command::FindRoute { start_node: 0, end_node: 3, data_size: 60 }
];

// Your function would take n, initial_links, and commands as input
// and return a Vec<Option<u64>> containing the results of the FindRoute commands.
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The solution must produce the correct minimum latency routes, considering congestion and capacity.
*   Efficiency: The solution must handle the given constraints and the number of queries and updates within the time limit.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a combination of algorithmic knowledge (shortest path algorithms), data structure understanding (graph representation, potentially priority queues or other specialized structures), and careful attention to detail to handle the congestion calculation and various edge cases. Good luck!

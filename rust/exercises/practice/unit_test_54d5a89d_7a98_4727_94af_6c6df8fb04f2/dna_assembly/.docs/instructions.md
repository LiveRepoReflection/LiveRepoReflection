## Problem: Efficient DNA Fragment Assembly

### Question Description

You are working for a cutting-edge genomics research lab. Your primary task is to develop an efficient algorithm for assembling DNA fragments generated by a shotgun sequencing process.

In shotgun sequencing, a long DNA strand is broken into numerous smaller fragments. The goal is to reconstruct the original DNA sequence from these fragments. Due to limitations in sequencing technology, the orientation of each fragment is unknown (i.e., you don't know which end is the "start" and which is the "end"). Additionally, sequencing errors can introduce mismatches between overlapping fragments.

Given a set of DNA fragments, your task is to find the shortest possible sequence that contains each fragment or its reverse complement as a substring.

**Specifics:**

*   **Input:** A `Vec<String>` of DNA fragments. Each string consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
*   **Reverse Complement:** The reverse complement of a DNA fragment is obtained by reversing the fragment and replacing each base with its complement ('A' becomes 'T', 'T' becomes 'A', 'C' becomes 'G', and 'G' becomes 'C'). For example, the reverse complement of "ACGT" is "TGCA".
*   **Output:** The shortest possible string that contains each input fragment (or its reverse complement) as a substring. If multiple shortest strings exist, return any one of them.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   The number of fragments can be large (up to 1000).
    *   Fragment lengths can vary (up to 100).
    *   The solution must be computationally efficient to process large datasets within a reasonable time. An O(n^2) or better time complexity is expected, where n is the number of fragments.
    *   Assume that all fragments can be assembled into a contiguous sequence. (I.e., a solution always exists.)
    *   Mismatches between fragments are allowed, but you should aim to minimize the overall length of the assembled sequence, implying that the solution must intelligently handle potential sequencing errors.

**Example:**

```
Input: ["ACG", "CGA", "GAC"]
Possible shortest string: "ACGA" or "GACG"
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Handling Overlaps:** The core challenge lies in efficiently finding the optimal overlaps between fragments (or their reverse complements).
*   **Optimization:** You'll need to consider algorithmic optimizations to achieve the required efficiency, such as using appropriate data structures or approximation algorithms.
*   **Error Handling:** While the problem statement guarantees a solution, consider how your approach might handle cases where there are significant sequencing errors that prevent a perfect assembly. The goal is to be robust to errors.

**Hint:** Consider exploring graph-based approaches (e.g., overlap graphs) or string algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) to solve this problem efficiently. Also consider using a heuristic search algorithm to make the process more efficient.

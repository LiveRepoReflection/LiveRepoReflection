Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test advanced skills and optimization techniques:

## Project Name

`distributed-consensus`

## Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, in-memory version of a distributed consensus algorithm based on Raft.  Your implementation will simulate a cluster of nodes that must agree on a sequence of operations to execute.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Node States:** Implement the three Raft node states: *Leader*, *Follower*, and *Candidate*.  Nodes start as Followers.

2.  **Election Process:** Implement the election process:
    *   When a Follower doesn't receive communication from a Leader within a certain timeout (`election_timeout`), it becomes a Candidate.
    *   Candidates increment their term number, vote for themselves, and request votes from other nodes.
    *   A Candidate becomes a Leader if it receives votes from a majority of the cluster.
    *   If a Candidate discovers another node with a higher term, it immediately reverts to Follower state.
    *   If an election timeout occurs while a node is a Candidate, a new election should begin.

3.  **Log Replication:** Implement the basic log replication process:
    *   The Leader receives *commands* (represented as simple strings) to append to its log.
    *   The Leader replicates these commands to all Followers by sending `AppendEntries` RPCs.
    *   Followers append the commands to their logs, unless their log conflicts with the Leader's log based on index and term. Conflicts must be resolved by truncating and overwriting follower logs.

4.  **Command Execution:**  Once a command is safely replicated to a majority of the cluster (committed), it can be considered *committed*. Committed commands should be applied to the node's state machine.  In this simplified version, the state machine is represented by an `i64` that starts at `0`.  A command is applied by converting the string to an `i64` and adding it to the current state. If the command string can not be converted to an i64, it should be ignored.

5.  **Persistence:** Implement a very basic in-memory log persistence mechanism. Each node should store its log and current term in memory. Node restarts are not part of the problem scope.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Network Simulation:**  Assume an unreliable network. `AppendEntries` and `RequestVote` RPCs can be lost or delayed.  Implement retry mechanisms with appropriate timeouts.  The network is considered partitioned if a majority of nodes cannot communicate with each other.
*   **Log Consistency:**  Ensure log consistency across all nodes. Handle conflicting log entries correctly.
*   **Leader Stability:**  Minimize unnecessary leader elections.  Implement mechanisms to prevent split votes.
*   **Concurrency:**  The system must be thread-safe.  Handle concurrent access to shared data structures (logs, state machine, etc.) safely using appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., Mutexes, RwLocks, Channels).
*   **Optimization:**  Optimize for throughput and latency.  Consider batching `AppendEntries` RPCs to reduce network overhead.  Avoid unnecessary copying of log entries.
*   **Term numbers:** Term numbers are monotonically increasing.
*   **Majority:** In the event of an even number of nodes, majority is defined as strictly more than half. E.g. in a cluster of 4 nodes, a majority requires 3 votes.

**Input:**

*   `num_nodes`:  The number of nodes in the cluster.
*   `commands`: A vector of strings representing the commands to be executed by the cluster.  The commands should be distributed randomly to different nodes.

**Output:**

*   After processing all commands, return a vector containing the final state machine value of each node in the cluster.  All nodes that are part of the consensus should have the same state machine value. In the event of an unrecoverable error or partition, return an error status.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The solution should be able to handle a cluster of up to 10 nodes.
*   The solution should be able to process a sequence of up to 1000 commands.
*   The total execution time should be minimized.

**Real-World Considerations (Implicit):**

This problem simulates core aspects of distributed systems, such as fault tolerance, data consistency, and leader election. A successful implementation demonstrates an understanding of these concepts in a practical context.

This problem is designed to be very challenging and requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and Rust's memory management. Good luck!

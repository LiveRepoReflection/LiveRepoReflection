Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard in difficulty, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and considering real-world constraints.

**Project Name:** `DistributedLogAnalyzer`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a distributed log analyzer. Imagine a system where log entries are continuously generated by multiple servers (represented as nodes in a graph). Each log entry has a timestamp (Unix epoch in milliseconds) and a severity level (Error, Warning, Info, Debug). The log entries are initially stored locally on each server, but for analysis, they need to be aggregated.

The servers are interconnected in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The system has a single central coordinator node (node 0). Other nodes periodically send their log entries to their direct successors in the DAG. The central coordinator (node 0) ultimately receives all log entries from all other nodes, either directly or indirectly.

Your task is to implement a function that processes the log data received by the central coordinator and answers queries efficiently.

**Input:**

*   `num_nodes: usize`: The number of servers in the system, including the coordinator (node 0). Nodes are numbered from 0 to `num_nodes - 1`.
*   `edges: Vec<(usize, usize)>`: A vector of tuples representing the directed edges in the DAG. Each tuple `(u, v)` represents an edge from node `u` to node `v`. It's guaranteed that the graph is a DAG and that node 0 is reachable from all other nodes.
*   `logs: Vec<(usize, Vec<(u64, String, String)>)>`:  A vector representing the log data received by the central coordinator (node 0). Each tuple `(node_id, log_entries)` represents the logs originating from `node_id`. `log_entries` is a vector of tuples `(timestamp, severity, message)`, where `timestamp` is a Unix epoch in milliseconds (`u64`), `severity` is one of "Error", "Warning", "Info", "Debug" (case-sensitive), and `message` is the log message string. The `logs` vector contains only the logs that have reached the central coordinator.

*   `queries: Vec<(u64, u64, String)>`:  A vector of queries. Each tuple `(start_time, end_time, severity)` represents a query asking for the number of log entries with the given `severity` (case-sensitive) within the specified time range (`start_time` and `end_time` are Unix epochs in milliseconds, inclusive).

**Output:**

*   `Vec<usize>`: A vector of integers. Each integer represents the count of log entries matching the corresponding query in the `queries` vector.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_nodes <= 100,000`
*   `0 <= edges.len() <= 200,000`
*   `0 <= node_id < num_nodes` in `logs`
*   `1 <= log_entries.len() <= 1000` per node in `logs`
*   `1 <= queries.len() <= 100,000`
*   `0 <= start_time <= end_time <= 10^12`
*   Log entries for each node are provided in **ascending order** of timestamp.
*   The total number of log entries across all nodes in `logs` can be up to `1,000,000`.
*   The solution must be optimized for performance. Naive solutions that iterate through all log entries for each query will likely time out. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to achieve efficient query processing.

**Example:**

```
num_nodes = 3
edges = [(1, 0), (2, 0)]
logs = [
    (1, [(1000, "Error", "Something went wrong"), (2000, "Warning", "Low memory")]),
    (2, [(1500, "Info", "Service started"), (2500, "Debug", "Variable x = 5")])
]
queries = [
    (1200, 2200, "Warning"),
    (1000, 3000, "Info"),
    (0, 1100, "Error")
]

// Expected Output: [1, 1, 1]
// Explanation:
// - Query 1: One "Warning" entry (2000) falls within the time range 1200-2200.
// - Query 2: One "Info" entry (1500) falls within the time range 1000-3000.
// - Query 3: One "Error" entry (1000) falls within the time range 0-1100.
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Data Structures:** Think about how to store the log data efficiently for fast filtering and counting.  Consider using a data structure that allows for efficient range queries based on timestamp.
*   **Algorithm:**  A naive O(M * Q) solution (where M is the total number of log entries and Q is the number of queries) will likely time out. You need to optimize the query processing.  Consider using binary search or other techniques to quickly find the relevant log entries for each query.
*   **Real-world:**  This problem mirrors a common task in distributed systems monitoring and analysis. Efficient log aggregation and querying are crucial for identifying issues and understanding system behavior.
*   **Edge cases:** Consider empty logs, empty queries, and queries with invalid time ranges.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques to achieve an efficient solution within the given constraints. Good luck!

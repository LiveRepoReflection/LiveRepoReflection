Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and a real-world scenario.

**Project Name:** `OptimalNetworkRouting`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a large-scale communication network. The network consists of `N` nodes, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.  Each node represents a router.  Connections between nodes are represented by a list of bidirectional edges. The network is *not* guaranteed to be fully connected.

Each edge has a *latency* (positive integer) and a *bandwidth* (positive integer).  Packets must be routed from a source node `S` to a destination node `D`.

However, the packets are not all the same. Each packet has a `priority` (positive integer). The network must support multiple concurrent packet flows, each with its own source, destination, and priority.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology, a list of packet flows, and a maximum tolerable latency `L`, determines the maximum number of packets that can be successfully routed while adhering to the following constraints:

1.  **Latency Constraint:** The total latency of the path taken by *any* packet from its source to its destination must be less than or equal to `L`.

2.  **Bandwidth Constraint:** For *any* edge in the network, the total bandwidth required by all packets traversing that edge cannot exceed the edge's bandwidth capacity.

3.  **Priority Scheduling:** Packets with higher priority should be routed first. If two packets have the same priority, break ties arbitrarily (e.g., by packet ID).

4.  **Optimal Throughput:** Maximize the number of packets successfully routed.

**Input:**

*   `N: usize`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges: Vec<(usize, usize, u32, u32)>`: A vector of tuples representing the network edges.  Each tuple `(u, v, latency, bandwidth)` represents a bidirectional edge between nodes `u` and `v` with the given latency and bandwidth. Latency and bandwidth are both unsigned 32-bit integers.
*   `flows: Vec<(usize, usize, u32, usize)>`: A vector of tuples representing the packet flows. Each tuple `(source, destination, priority, packet_id)` represents a packet flow from `source` to `destination` with the given `priority` and a unique `packet_id`. Priority is an unsigned 32-bit integer. Packet ID is an unsigned 64-bit integer.
*   `L: u32`: The maximum tolerable latency for any packet.

**Output:**

*   `usize`: The maximum number of packets that can be successfully routed while satisfying all constraints.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 100`
*   `0 <= edges.len() <= N * (N - 1) / 2` (No more edges than a complete graph)
*   `0 <= flows.len() <= 1000`
*   `0 <= source, destination < N` for all flows
*   `1 <= latency, bandwidth <= 1000` for all edges
*   `1 <= priority <= 1000` for all flows
*   The graph may be disconnected.  Packets to unreachable destinations should not be routed.
*   Implementations must be reasonably efficient. Naive solutions will likely time out on larger test cases. Consider algorithm efficiency.
*   The latency and bandwidth values are reasonably sized such that overflow considerations are necessary.

**Example:**

```rust
let n = 4;
let edges = vec![
    (0, 1, 10, 5), // Edge between node 0 and 1, latency 10, bandwidth 5
    (1, 2, 5, 2),  // Edge between node 1 and 2, latency 5, bandwidth 2
    (2, 3, 15, 10), // Edge between node 2 and 3, latency 15, bandwidth 10
    (0, 3, 25, 3),  // Edge between node 0 and 3, latency 25, bandwidth 3
];
let flows = vec![
    (0, 2, 1, 1),  // Packet from 0 to 2, priority 1, ID 1
    (1, 3, 2, 2),  // Packet from 1 to 3, priority 2, ID 2
    (0, 3, 1, 3),  // Packet from 0 to 3, priority 1, ID 3
];
let l = 30;

let max_packets = solve(n, edges, flows, l); // The function you need to implement

println!("Maximum packets routed: {}", max_packets); // Expected output: 3

```

**Hints and Considerations:**

*   Think about how to represent the network efficiently.  An adjacency list or matrix might be appropriate.
*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest-path algorithm to find paths that satisfy the latency constraint.
*   How will you handle the bandwidth constraints? You'll need to track the bandwidth usage on each edge.
*   Consider using a priority queue to process the packets in the correct order.
*   The core of the problem is a resource allocation problem. You'll likely need to try different combinations of routed packets to find the optimal solution. Think about optimization techniques like greedy approaches, binary search (if applicable), or dynamic programming (though DP might be overkill).
*   Be careful with integer overflows.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, data structure manipulation, and optimization techniques.  Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Rust programming problem. Here it is:

## Project Name

`OptimalRoutePlanner`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal route planning service for a delivery company. The company operates in a city represented as a directed graph where each node is an intersection and each edge is a street with a specific travel time and toll cost. The company needs to deliver packages from a central depot (node 0) to various destination nodes within a given time limit and budget.

**Input:**

*   `num_intersections`: An integer representing the number of intersections in the city (numbered 0 to `num_intersections - 1`).
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a street: `(from_intersection, to_intersection, travel_time, toll_cost)`.
*   `destination_nodes`: A vector of integers, representing the intersections where packages need to be delivered.
*   `time_limit`: An integer representing the maximum allowed travel time for the entire route.
*   `budget`: An integer representing the maximum allowed toll cost for the entire route.

**Objective:**

Find the shortest possible route that starts at the depot (node 0), visits all destination nodes at least once, and returns to the depot (node 0), while adhering to the given `time_limit` and `budget`. "Shortest possible route" refers to the route with the minimum total travel time.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= num_intersections <= 100`
*   `1 <= edges.len() <= 500`
*   `0 <= from_intersection, to_intersection < num_intersections`
*   `1 <= travel_time <= 100`
*   `0 <= toll_cost <= 50`
*   `1 <= destination_nodes.len() <= 10`
*   `1 <= time_limit <= 1000`
*   `0 <= budget <= 500`
*   There is at least one path from the depot to each destination node.
*   It is possible to visit all destination nodes and return to the depot within the time limit and budget.
*   The graph may contain cycles and parallel edges.

**Output:**

Return an `Option<Vec<usize>>` representing the optimal route as a vector of intersection indices, starting and ending at the depot (node 0). If no such route exists within the constraints, return `None`. If multiple optimal routes exist, return any one of them.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution must be efficient enough to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds).
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize the search for the optimal route.
*   Avoid unnecessary computations or memory allocations.

**Example:**

```
num_intersections = 4
edges = [(0, 1, 10, 5), (0, 2, 15, 2), (1, 3, 12, 3), (2, 3, 10, 4), (3, 0, 5, 1)]
destination_nodes = [3]
time_limit = 50
budget = 10

// One possible optimal route: [0, 2, 3, 0]
// Total travel time: 15 + 10 + 5 = 30
// Total toll cost: 2 + 4 + 1 = 7
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or similar techniques to find the shortest paths between nodes, considering both time and cost constraints.
*   Explore dynamic programming approaches to optimize the search for the optimal route.
*   Think about how to efficiently handle the "at least once" requirement for visiting destination nodes.  Consider bitmasking techniques.

This problem combines graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints, making it a challenging and sophisticated task for experienced programmers. Good luck!

**Problem:** Optimized Multi-Source Shortest Path Computation on a Dynamic Terrain

**Description:**

You are given a grid representing a terrain. Each cell in the grid has an associated cost to traverse. You are also given a set of source locations on this grid. The task is to design and implement a system that efficiently calculates the shortest path from *any* of the given source locations to *any* other cell on the grid.

However, there's a twist: the terrain is dynamic. The cost of traversing a cell can change at any time. Your system must be able to handle these changes efficiently and recalculate shortest paths without recomputing everything from scratch each time.  Furthermore, the set of source locations can also change at any time (sources can be added or removed).

**Input:**

1.  `grid`: A 2D vector of integers representing the terrain. `grid[i][j]` is the cost to traverse cell (i, j).  The grid dimensions are `rows` x `cols`.
2.  `sources`: A vector of tuples `(row, col)` representing the initial set of source locations.
3.  `queries`: A series of requests. Each request can be one of three types:
    *   `("get_shortest_path", row, col)`:  Return the shortest path cost from *any* of the current source locations to cell (row, col). If no path exists, return -1.
    *   `("update_cost", row, col, new_cost)`: Update the cost of cell (row, col) to `new_cost`.
    *   `("update_sources", new_sources)`:  Update the set of source locations to `new_sources`, where `new_sources` is a vector of tuples `(row, col)`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= rows, cols <= 1000`
*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
*   `0 <= row < rows`, `0 <= col < cols` for all cell coordinates.
*   The number of sources is variable, but will not exceed 1000 at any given time.
*   The number of queries will be substantial (e.g., up to 100,000).
*   The time limit for processing all queries is strict.  Solutions that recalculate shortest paths from scratch for each query will likely time out.
*   Memory usage should be reasonable.

**Requirements:**

1.  Implement a Rust struct or class that encapsulates the terrain, source locations, and shortest path computation logic.
2.  Provide methods to initialize the system with the grid and initial sources.
3.  Provide methods to handle the three types of queries: `get_shortest_path`, `update_cost`, and `update_sources`.
4.  The `get_shortest_path` method should return the shortest path cost from *any* of the source locations to the specified cell.
5.  The `update_cost` and `update_sources` methods should efficiently update the system's internal state to reflect the changes, minimizing the amount of recomputation required.
6.  Your solution must be significantly more efficient than recomputing shortest paths using Dijkstra's or A\* from all sources for every query.  Consider using techniques like incremental updates to the shortest path data structure.  Think about how changes to the terrain or source locations only affect a localized area.
7.  Handle edge cases gracefully, such as disconnected graphs, invalid source locations, and queries for cells outside the grid.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: The system must correctly calculate shortest paths for all valid queries.
*   Efficiency: The system must process all queries within the time limit.  The performance of `update_cost` and `update_sources` is particularly important.
*   Code Quality: The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.  Use appropriate data structures and algorithms.  Consider using Rust's features to ensure memory safety and prevent data races.

This problem tests the ability to combine graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques in a real-world scenario.  Good luck!

`DistributedRateLimiter`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service. This service is critical for protecting backend systems from being overwhelmed by excessive requests from various clients in a distributed environment.

The rate limiter should enforce rate limits based on a combination of factors:

*   **Client Identifier:** Each client is identified by a unique string.
*   **API Endpoint:**  Each API endpoint has its own rate limit.
*   **Time Window:** Rate limits are applied over a specific time window (e.g., requests per second, requests per minute).

**Requirements:**

1.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limits for each (client, endpoint) pair should be configurable at runtime.  This means you need a way to dynamically update the rate limits without restarting the service.

2.  **High Availability:** The rate limiter must be highly available and resilient to failures. Single points of failure are unacceptable.

3.  **Low Latency:** The rate limiter should add minimal latency to requests.  Every millisecond counts.

4.  **Accuracy:**  The rate limiter should be as accurate as possible, but eventual consistency is acceptable. It's better to slightly over-allow requests than to consistently block legitimate traffic.

5.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be able to handle a large number of clients and API endpoints, with the ability to scale horizontally as needed.

6.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must handle concurrent requests efficiently.

7.  **Storage Efficiency:** The rate limiter must be efficient in terms of storage space.

8.  **Atomic Operations**: Given the concurrency requirement, you need to ensure atomicity when updating rate limit counters.

**Constraints:**

*   You are free to choose any suitable data store for storing rate limit information. Consider the trade-offs between different storage options (e.g., Redis, Memcached, a distributed database like Cassandra or DynamoDB, or an in-memory solution with persistence). Justify your choice.
*   Assume that the service will be deployed across multiple machines.
*   Assume a very large number of unique clients and API endpoints.
*   The time window granularity should support at least seconds and minutes.

**Specific Tasks:**

1.  Define the API for the rate limiter service. Consider the operations needed to update rate limits, check if a request is allowed, and any necessary management functions.

2.  Design the data structures to store rate limit information efficiently. Consider how to handle different time windows.

3.  Implement the core rate limiting logic. Pay attention to concurrency and atomicity.

4.  Describe your approach to achieving high availability and scalability.

5.  Discuss the trade-offs you made in your design choices, particularly regarding accuracy, latency, and storage efficiency.

6.  Consider how you would monitor the performance of the rate limiter service in production.

This problem is open-ended and requires you to make architectural and implementation decisions. The focus is on demonstrating your understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, and performance optimization. There are many valid solutions, but the best solutions will be well-reasoned, efficient, and practical.

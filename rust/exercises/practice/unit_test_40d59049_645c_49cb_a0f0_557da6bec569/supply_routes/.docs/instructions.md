## Question: Efficient Supply Chain Routing

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the delivery routes for a large logistics company operating across a vast network of warehouses and distribution centers. The company wants to minimize its operational costs by efficiently routing delivery trucks.

The logistics network can be represented as a directed graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent locations, either warehouses (supply nodes) or distribution centers (demand nodes).
*   **Edges:** Represent road segments between locations. Each edge has:
    *   A `capacity`: The maximum number of trucks that can travel on that road segment per unit time.
    *   A `cost`: The cost associated with sending one truck along that road segment.
    *   A `delay`: The time it takes for a truck to traverse that road segment.

Each warehouse has a specific `supply` of goods, and each distribution center has a specific `demand` for goods. The total supply must equal the total demand to ensure all demands are met.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that determines the optimal flow of trucks along each road segment to satisfy all demands from the available supplies while adhering to the following constraints and objectives:

1.  **Flow Conservation:** For each node (except warehouses and distribution centers), the total inflow of trucks must equal the total outflow.

2.  **Capacity Constraints:** The flow (number of trucks) on each edge must not exceed its capacity.

3.  **Demand Satisfaction:** The total inflow of trucks into each distribution center must equal its demand.

4.  **Supply Utilization:** The total outflow of trucks from each warehouse must not exceed its supply. It is allowable for a warehouse to not exhaust its entire supply, if doing so increases total cost.

5.  **Cost Minimization:** The primary objective is to minimize the total cost of transporting goods, calculated as the sum of (flow \* cost) for each edge used.

6.  **Time Windows (Hard Constraint):** Each distribution center has an associated time window `[start_time, end_time]`. The truck must arrive within this time window. Arriving outside of the time window is not allowed. The `delay` on the path must be considered to calculate arrival time.

7.  **Truck Limit (Hard Constraint):** The company only has a limited number of trucks available. The total number of trucks used across all routes cannot exceed this limit.

**Input:**

*   A description of the graph, including:
    *   A list of nodes with their types (warehouse or distribution center) and supply/demand values.
    *   A list of directed edges with their capacity, cost, and delay.
    *   Warehouse supplies and Distribution Center demands.
    *   Time windows for all distribution centers.
    *   Total number of trucks available.

**Output:**

*   A description of the optimal flow for each edge, indicating the number of trucks that should travel along that edge.
*   The total cost associated with this flow.
*   Indicate if the problem is infeasible (no solution satisfies all constraints).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes can be up to 1000.
*   The number of edges can be up to 5000.
*   Supplies and demands can be up to 10000 units.
*   Capacities can be up to 100 units.
*   Costs can be up to 10 units.
*   Delays can be up to 100 units.
*   Time windows can span up to 200 time units.

**Evaluation:**

Solutions will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:** Whether the solution satisfies all constraints (flow conservation, capacity, demand, supply, time windows, truck limits).
*   **Optimality:** How close the solution's total cost is to the optimal cost. A tolerance will be applied for near-optimal solutions.
*   **Efficiency:** The runtime of the algorithm. Solutions should be able to handle the given constraints within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 1 minute).

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases. Efficient implementations are crucial for achieving optimal solutions within the given constraints.

## Question: Efficient Route Planning for Drone Delivery Network

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient route planning system for a drone delivery network operating in a densely populated urban environment. The city is modeled as a weighted graph, where nodes represent delivery locations (warehouses, customer residences, drop-off points) and edges represent possible flight paths between these locations. Edge weights represent the estimated flight time between locations, considering factors like distance, wind conditions, and air traffic.

Your system must handle a large number of delivery requests concurrently, each with its own origin, destination, and delivery deadline.  Each drone has a limited battery capacity, represented as a maximum flight time budget. A drone can only complete a delivery if the total flight time for the route (origin to destination) is within its battery budget. Drones can recharge at designated charging stations located at specific nodes in the graph. Recharging takes a fixed amount of time `T_charge`.  A drone can visit a charging station multiple times.

The goal is to design an algorithm that efficiently assigns delivery requests to drones and determines the optimal routes for each drone to minimize the total delivery time while satisfying all constraints.  Total delivery time is defined as the sum of flight times and charging times for all deliveries.

**Constraints:**

*   The city graph can have up to 10,000 nodes and 50,000 edges.
*   The number of delivery requests can be up to 10,000.
*   Each drone has a unique ID and a limited battery capacity (maximum flight time).
*   Each delivery request has a unique ID, an origin node, a destination node, and a delivery deadline.
*   Drones must return to their starting warehouse (specified for each drone) after completing their assigned deliveries.
*   A drone can handle multiple delivery requests sequentially, but must return to its starting warehouse within a global timeframe `T_max`.
*   The graph is directed.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Charging stations have infinite capacity (any number of drones can charge at the same station simultaneously).
*   All drones start with a full battery at the beginning.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

1.  **Graph Data:** A list of nodes (with node IDs) and a list of edges (with source node ID, destination node ID, and flight time).  Also, a list of charging station node IDs.

2.  **Drone Data:** A list of drones, each with its drone ID, starting warehouse node ID, battery capacity (maximum flight time), and the global timeframe `T_max`.

3.  **Delivery Request Data:** A list of delivery requests, each with its request ID, origin node ID, destination node ID, and delivery deadline.

**Output:**

The output should be a list of delivery routes for each drone. Each route should specify the sequence of locations visited by the drone, including delivery origin/destination nodes and charging stations, in the order they are visited.  The output should also include the total delivery time for each drone, and the overall total delivery time for all drones.

Specifically, the output format should be:

```
Drone <drone_id>:
  Total Delivery Time: <total_delivery_time>
  Route: [<node_id_1>, <node_id_2>, ..., <node_id_n>]
...
Overall Total Delivery Time: <overall_total_delivery_time>
```

**Example:**

```
Drone 123:
  Total Delivery Time: 45.5
  Route: [1, 5, 2, 7, 1]  // Starts at warehouse 1, delivers from 5 to 2, recharges at 7, returns to 1
Drone 456:
  Total Delivery Time: 22.0
  Route: [3, 8, 9, 3] // Starts at warehouse 3, delivers from 8 to 9, returns to 3
Overall Total Delivery Time: 67.5
```

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  The generated routes must satisfy all constraints (battery capacity, delivery deadlines, return to warehouse, etc.).
*   **Efficiency:** The overall total delivery time should be minimized.  Solutions with lower total delivery times will be ranked higher.
*   **Scalability:** Your solution should be able to handle large input datasets within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 minutes).

**Tips for implementation**

*   The graph can contain cycles and negative weights.
*   Consider using appropriate graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, A\*) for route planning.  You may need to adapt these algorithms to handle battery constraints and charging stations.
*   Explore different optimization techniques (e.g., dynamic programming, heuristics, approximation algorithms) to find near-optimal solutions within the time limit.
*   Pay attention to data structures and code organization to ensure efficiency and maintainability.
*   Consider the trade-offs between solution quality and runtime complexity when choosing your algorithms and data structures.

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal routing algorithm for a distributed network. The network consists of `n` nodes, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.  Each node represents a server capable of processing and forwarding data packets.  The network topology is represented by a list of bidirectional edges, where each edge `(u, v, w)` indicates a connection between nodes `u` and `v` with a associated cost `w`. The cost `w` represents the latency or bandwidth usage of traversing that edge.

Additionally, each node `i` has a processing capacity `c_i`, representing the maximum number of packets it can process per unit time.

You are given a set of `m` data packets that need to be routed from their respective source nodes `s_j` to their destination nodes `t_j`. Each packet `j` has a size `p_j` and a priority `q_j`.

The goal is to determine the *minimum total cost* to route all `m` packets from their sources to their destinations, subject to the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity Constraint:** At any given node `i`, the sum of the sizes of packets being processed or forwarded through that node cannot exceed its processing capacity `c_i`.
2.  **Routing Constraint:** Each packet must be fully routed from its source to its destination.  A packet can be split into smaller fragments and routed along different paths if necessary, but the sum of the fragments must equal the original packet size.
3.  **Priority Consideration:** Packets with higher priority should be given preference when routing. Lower priority packets can be delayed if necessary to accommodate higher priority packets, but all packets must eventually be routed.

You need to implement a function that takes the following inputs and returns the minimum total cost to route all packets, or `None` if it's impossible to route all packets given the network constraints.

**Input:**

*   `n: usize`: The number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges: Vec<(usize, usize, u64)>`: A list of bidirectional edges, where each tuple represents `(node_u, node_v, edge_cost)`.
*   `capacities: Vec<u64>`: A vector of node capacities, where `capacities[i]` is the capacity of node `i`.
*   `packets: Vec<(usize, usize, u64, u64)>`: A list of data packets, where each tuple represents `(source_node, destination_node, packet_size, packet_priority)`.

**Output:**

*   `Option<u64>`: The minimum total cost to route all packets, or `None` if routing is impossible.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `0 <= m <= 100`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= w <= 1000` (edge cost)
*   `1 <= c_i <= 10000` (node capacity)
*   `1 <= p_j <= 1000` (packet size)
*   `1 <= q_j <= 100` (packet priority)

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The solution should be efficient enough to handle reasonably sized networks and packet sets within a time limit.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize the time complexity.
*   Explore potential optimizations such as using heuristics or approximation algorithms to improve performance.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of constraints. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult, incorporate advanced concepts, and require optimization.

## Project Name

`DistributedLockManager`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed lock manager in Rust. This lock manager should allow multiple independent processes running on different machines to acquire and release locks on shared resources. The primary goal is to ensure mutual exclusion: only one process can hold a lock on a particular resource at any given time.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Lock Acquisition:** Implement a function `acquire_lock(resource_id: &str, client_id: &str, timeout_ms: u64) -> Result<(), LockError>`. This function attempts to acquire a lock on the resource identified by `resource_id`. `client_id` uniquely identifies the process requesting the lock.  `timeout_ms` specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) the function should wait to acquire the lock. The function should return `Ok(())` upon successful acquisition.

2.  **Lock Release:** Implement a function `release_lock(resource_id: &str, client_id: &str) -> Result<(), LockError>`. This function releases the lock on the resource identified by `resource_id`, held by the client identified by `client_id`.

3.  **Lock Expiration:** Implement a mechanism where locks automatically expire after a certain period if the holding process crashes or becomes unresponsive. This prevents deadlocks.  Configure the expiration time on a per-resource basis.

4.  **Lock Re-entrancy (Optional but Highly Recommended):** The lock manager should support re-entrant locks, meaning a client can acquire the same lock multiple times without blocking itself.  The lock should only be fully released when the client releases it the same number of times it acquired it.

5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The lock manager should be designed to be fault-tolerant. Consider what happens if one of the lock manager nodes fails.

6.  **High Availability and Scalability:** The lock manager must be designed to be highly available and scalable to handle a large number of concurrent lock requests.

7.  **Concurrency:**  The lock manager itself must be thread-safe to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **No external dependencies:**  You are **not** allowed to use external crates for distributed consensus (e.g., Raft, Paxos) or existing distributed lock implementations.  You *can* use standard Rust libraries for networking, threading, and data structures.
*   **Performance:**  Lock acquisition and release should be as fast as possible. Latency is critical.
*   **Contention:** The lock manager must handle high contention scenarios gracefully without excessive CPU usage or deadlocks.
*   **Lock Granularity:** You can assume that `resource_id` is a reasonably sized string (e.g., less than 256 bytes).
*   **Network Communication:** Processes will communicate with the lock manager over a network. You can choose your preferred protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, gRPC, etc.), but the implementation should be efficient.
*   **Error Handling:** Define a suitable `LockError` enum to represent various error conditions (e.g., LockAcquisitionTimeout, LockNotHeld, ResourceDoesNotExist, InternalError).

**System Design Aspects:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:**  Describe (in comments or a separate document) the distributed architecture you propose for the lock manager. Consider using a leader-election strategy or a distributed consensus protocol. Explain how the architecture handles node failures and ensures data consistency.
*   **Data Storage:**  Describe how you will store the lock state (e.g., in-memory, persistent storage). Consider the trade-offs between performance and durability.

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   The lock acquisition and release operations should have a time complexity of O(1) or O(log n) in the best and average cases, where n is the number of locks managed by the system. Avoid O(n) or worse complexity.

**Multiple Valid Approaches:**

*   There are several valid approaches to solving this problem, each with its own trade-offs.  The best solution will balance performance, fault tolerance, and complexity. Consider the trade-offs of different concurrency primitives (e.g., Mutex, RwLock, channels, atomics).

This problem is deliberately open-ended to allow for creativity and exploration of different design and implementation choices. Good luck!

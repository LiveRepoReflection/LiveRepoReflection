Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging Rust coding problem.

### Project Name

`DistributedLogAnalysis`

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a distributed log analysis system. This system processes log entries generated by a cluster of servers and identifies potential anomalies.

**System Overview:**

The system consists of multiple worker nodes and a single coordinator node. Each worker node receives a stream of log entries from a subset of servers in the cluster. The worker nodes perform initial analysis on the log entries and forward aggregated statistics to the coordinator node. The coordinator node then combines the statistics from all worker nodes to detect global anomalies.

**Log Entry Format:**

Each log entry is a string containing the following information, separated by commas:

*   `timestamp`: A Unix timestamp (integer, seconds since epoch).
*   `server_id`: A unique identifier for the server that generated the log entry (string).
*   `log_level`: The severity level of the log entry (string: "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR").
*   `message`: The log message (string, can contain any characters except commas).

Example: `1678886400,server123,ERROR,Disk space is critically low`

**Worker Node Functionality:**

Each worker node should:

1.  Receive log entries from an input stream (e.g., a channel or a file).
2.  Maintain a time-windowed count of log entries for each `server_id` and `log_level` combination. The window size is configurable (in seconds). Let's call this a "log count".
3.  Every `aggregation_interval` seconds (configurable), the worker node should calculate the average "log count" for each `server_id` and `log_level` combination across the time window.
4.  Send these aggregated statistics to the coordinator node.

**Coordinator Node Functionality:**

The coordinator node should:

1.  Receive aggregated statistics from all worker nodes.
2.  Maintain a global average "log count" for each `server_id` and `log_level` combination.
3.  Detect anomalies by comparing the current "log count" from each worker node against the global average. An anomaly is detected if the worker node's current "log count" deviates from the global average by more than a configurable `anomaly_threshold` (a floating-point number representing a multiplier).

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Concurrency:** The system should be highly concurrent to handle a large volume of log entries from multiple worker nodes. Use Rust's concurrency primitives (e.g., `async/await`, channels, mutexes) effectively.
2.  **Efficiency:** The system should be efficient in terms of memory usage and processing time. Avoid unnecessary copying of data and use appropriate data structures for storing and retrieving statistics. Consider using `rayon` for parallel processing where applicable.
3.  **Fault Tolerance:**  The coordinator node should be resilient to worker node failures. If a worker node fails to send statistics, the coordinator node should continue to operate using the statistics from the remaining worker nodes.  Implement a timeout mechanism for receiving data from worker nodes.
4.  **Configuration:** The following parameters should be configurable:
    *   `time_window`: The size of the time window for aggregating log entries (in seconds).
    *   `aggregation_interval`: The interval at which worker nodes send aggregated statistics to the coordinator node (in seconds).
    *   `anomaly_threshold`: The threshold for detecting anomalies (a floating-point number).
    *   Number of worker nodes.
5.  **Anomaly Reporting:**  When an anomaly is detected, the coordinator node should print a message to the console indicating the `server_id`, `log_level`, current "log count", global average "log count", and the worker node that reported the anomaly.
6.  **Data Structures:**  Carefully choose appropriate data structures to efficiently store and update the statistics. Consider using hash maps, trees, or other structures depending on the trade-offs you want to make.
7.  **Real-time Processing:**  The system should process log entries in near real-time.
8.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid log entries, network errors, and other potential issues.
9.  **Resource Management:** Be mindful of resource consumption, especially memory, and avoid memory leaks. Utilize Rust's ownership and borrowing system to ensure memory safety.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of servers in the cluster can be very large (e.g., thousands or millions).
*   The volume of log entries can be very high (e.g., millions per second).
*   The system should be able to scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes.
*   Assume that timestamps are monotonically increasing within each worker node's stream of log entries.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a persistence mechanism to store the global average "log counts" on disk, so that the coordinator node can recover from failures without losing all historical data.
*   Implement a more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithm, such as using moving averages or standard deviations.
*   Add support for different log entry formats.
*   Implement a web interface for visualizing the log statistics and anomalies.

This problem requires the solver to demonstrate a strong understanding of Rust's concurrency features, data structures, algorithms, and system design principles. The optimization requirements and fault tolerance considerations make it a challenging task suitable for experienced Rust developers. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level question.

## Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a core component of a decentralized auction system. This system allows participants to bid on items using a blockchain-like structure to ensure transparency and immutability of bids.

The auction revolves around a single item. Participants can submit bids, each associated with a timestamp and a bidder identifier.  Your goal is to determine the winning bid(s) after a specific closing time, considering potential network latency and bid validity rules.

**Data Structures:**

*   `Bid`: Represents a single bid. Contains:
    *   `bidder_id`: A unique string identifying the bidder.
    *   `amount`: A `u64` representing the bid amount.
    *   `timestamp`: A `u64` representing the time (in milliseconds since epoch) when the bid was submitted.

*   `AuctionState`: Represents the state of the auction. Contains:
    *   `bids`: A vector (`Vec`) of `Bid` objects, representing all bids received so far.

**Task:**

Implement a function `determine_winners` that takes the `AuctionState`, a `closing_time` (a `u64` timestamp), and a `network_latency` tolerance (in milliseconds, also a `u64`) as input. The function should return a `Vec<String>` containing the `bidder_id` of the winning bid(s). If no valid bids exist, return an empty `Vec<String>`.

**Rules for Determining Winners:**

1.  **Validity Window:** A bid is considered valid only if its `timestamp` is less than or equal to the `closing_time` plus the `network_latency`.  This accounts for bids that may have been submitted slightly before the official closing time but arrive late due to network delays.

2.  **Highest Bid:** The winning bid(s) are the valid bid(s) with the highest `amount`.

3.  **Multiple Winners (Tie):** If multiple valid bids have the same highest `amount`, all bidders associated with those bids are considered winners. The `Vec<String>` you return should contain all winning `bidder_id` values.  The order of the `bidder_id` values in the returned `Vec<String>` does not matter.

4.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle the case where the `bids` vector is empty.
    *   Handle the case where all bids are invalid (timestamps are after the allowed window).
    *   Handle potential integer overflow when adding `closing_time` and `network_latency`. If overflow occurs, treat all bids as valid.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of bids can be very large (up to 10<sup>6</sup>).
*   The `closing_time` and `network_latency` can be large `u64` values.
*   Efficiency is crucial.  Your solution should be optimized for performance and memory usage. Avoid unnecessary copying or cloning of data.  Consider using appropriate data structures for efficient filtering and sorting (if sorting is required).
*   Assume the `bidder_id` strings are unique.

**Example:**

```
let auction_state = AuctionState {
    bids: vec![
        Bid { bidder_id: "A".to_string(), amount: 100, timestamp: 1678886400000 },
        Bid { bidder_id: "B".to_string(), amount: 150, timestamp: 1678886401000 },
        Bid { bidder_id: "C".to_string(), amount: 150, timestamp: 1678886402000 },
        Bid { bidder_id: "D".to_string(), amount: 120, timestamp: 1678886403000 },
    ],
};
let closing_time = 1678886402000;
let network_latency = 1000;

let winners = determine_winners(auction_state, closing_time, network_latency);
// Expected output: vec!["B".to_string(), "C".to_string()] (order doesn't matter)
```

This problem challenges you to think about data structures, algorithms, edge cases, and performance optimization, making it a good fit for a high-level programming competition. Good luck!

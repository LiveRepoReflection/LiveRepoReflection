Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar in difficulty to a LeetCode Hard problem.

### Project Name

```
k_anonymous_graph
```

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a system for anonymizing a social network graph to protect user privacy. The graph consists of nodes representing users and edges representing connections between them. Your goal is to transform the graph into a *k*-anonymous graph, where each node is connected to at least *k* other nodes.

**Definitions:**

*   **Social Network Graph:** A graph where nodes represent users and edges represent relationships between them.
*   ***k*-anonymous Graph:** A graph where every node has a degree (number of connected neighbors) of at least *k*.
*   **Edge Deletion:** Removing a connection between two users in the graph.
*   **Node Deletion:** Removing a user and all their connections from the graph.

**Input:**

You are given:

1.  `n`: The number of nodes in the graph, numbered from 0 to `n-1`.
2.  `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`. The input is guaranteed to not have duplicate edges.
3.  `k`: The anonymity threshold.

**Task:**

Write a function that takes the graph represented by `n` and `edges`, and the anonymity threshold `k` as input. The function should return a new vector of tuples representing the edges that remain in the *k*-anonymous graph after performing edge and node deletions.  The goal is to create a *k*-anonymous graph using a minimum number of node deletions.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100_000`
*   `0 <= edges.len() <= 200_000`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   The graph may not be connected.
*   The returned edges must not contain duplicate edges, and the order of the edges does not matter.
*   The returned edges must only contain nodes that are still in the graph after the anonymization process.
*   Nodes deleted from the graph should have the least impact on the number of edges that need to be removed to achieve k-anonymity.

**Optimization Requirements:**

The solution should be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Aim for a solution that can handle large graphs within reasonable time limits. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.

**Edge Cases:**

*   The input graph is already *k*-anonymous.
*   The input graph is empty.
*   It is impossible to make the graph *k*-anonymous, even after deleting all nodes. In this case, return an empty vector.
*   Self-loops are not allowed in the output graph. Input might contain self-loops, but they have to be excluded in the output.

**Example:**

```
n = 6
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)]
k = 2

// One possible output:
// [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)] // Nodes 0, 1, and 2 now all have degree >= 2
```

**Considerations:**

*   How will you represent the graph efficiently?
*   How will you identify nodes with a degree less than *k*?
*   In what order should nodes be removed to minimize the number of node deletions?
*   How will you handle disconnected components in the graph?
*   How will you ensure the final graph is *k*-anonymous?
*   How will you remove self-loops?

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, data structure selection, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

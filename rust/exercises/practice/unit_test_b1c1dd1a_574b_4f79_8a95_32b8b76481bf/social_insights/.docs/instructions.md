## Problem Title: Decentralized Social Network Analysis

### Problem Description

You are tasked with analyzing a large, decentralized social network. Unlike traditional centralized social networks, this network has no central server or authority. Instead, user data and relationships are distributed across a peer-to-peer network. Each user maintains a local database of their direct connections (friends) and some information about them. Due to the decentralized nature, complete network information is unavailable to any single node.

Your goal is to implement several analytical functions, focusing on efficiency and scalability in this distributed environment, while respecting privacy constraints (you can only access information of directly connected users).

The network is represented as follows:

*   **Users:** Each user has a unique `user_id` (represented as a `u64`).
*   **Connections:** Each user maintains a list of `user_id`s representing their direct connections (friends). This information is readily available for each user.
*   **User Data:** Each user also stores some basic information about their friends, specifically their `age` (represented as a `u8`).

You need to implement the following functions:

1.  **Average Friend Age (Local):** Given a `user_id`, calculate the average age of their direct friends. Return `None` if the user has no friends. This function should be highly optimized for single user lookups.

2.  **Mutual Friends Count:** Given two `user_id`s, determine the number of mutual friends they share. This function should be implemented in a way that minimizes unnecessary data access. Consider that either `user_id` may not exist in the network. Return 0 if either user has no friend.

3.  **"K-Hop" Friend Suggestion (Limited):** Given a `user_id` and an integer `k`, suggest a new friend for the user. The suggested friend should be someone who is exactly `k` hops away from the user in the network (i.e., a friend of a friend... `k` times). To avoid overwhelming the user with suggestions, you should only suggest one user who meet the criteria with the smallest `user_id`. If no suitable friend is found, return `None`. The `k` parameter will be constrained to a relatively small value (e.g., `1 <= k <= 3`), but the overall network size can be very large. You need to handle potential cycles in the network efficiently.

4.  **Influencer Identification (Approximate):** Given a percentage threshold `p` (e.g., 0.05 representing 5%), identify a set of users who are considered "influencers." An influencer is defined as a user who is connected to at least `p` percent of *all* users in the network. Since obtaining a complete list of all users is not possible due to the decentralized nature, you must implement an *approximate* algorithm. This can be achieved through random sampling of the network. The return type should be a `HashSet` of `user_id`s of the identified influencers.

    **Constraints:**

    *   **Decentralized Data:** You can only directly access the friend lists and age data of a specific user's direct connections. You cannot query a central database or access complete network information.
    *   **Privacy:** Do not store or transmit user data beyond what is strictly necessary to perform the calculations.
    *   **Scalability:** Your solution should be designed to handle a very large network (millions of users). Avoid algorithms with high time complexity (e.g., O(n^2) where n is the number of users).
    *   **Efficiency:** Prioritize efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize execution time.
    *   **Error Handling:** Handle cases where a user does not exist or has no friends gracefully.
    *   **Approximate Influencer Identification:** The influencer identification doesn't need to be perfectly accurate, but it should provide a reasonable approximation within the given constraints. You can assume the number of users in the network is very large.

**Input:**

You are provided with a `Network` struct (or similar data structure) that allows you to query the friend list and age of a user's direct connections. The `Network` struct will have the following methods:

*   `get_friends(user_id: u64) -> Option<Vec<u64>>`: Returns an `Option` containing a `Vec<u64>` of friend `user_id`s for the given `user_id`. Returns `None` if the user does not exist.
*   `get_age(user_id: u64) -> Option<u8>`: Returns an `Option` containing the `age` of the given `user_id`. Returns `None` if the user does not exist.

**Output:**

Implement the following functions with the specified signatures:

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

struct Network {
    // Implementation details (not visible to the user)
}

impl Network {
    fn get_friends(&self, user_id: u64) -> Option<Vec<u64>> { /* ... */ }
    fn get_age(&self, user_id: u64) -> Option<u8> { /* ... */ }
}

fn average_friend_age(network: &Network, user_id: u64) -> Option<f64> { /* ... */ }
fn mutual_friends_count(network: &Network, user_id1: u64, user_id2: u64) -> u64 { /* ... */ }
fn k_hop_friend_suggestion(network: &Network, user_id: u64, k: u32) -> Option<u64> { /* ... */ }
fn approximate_influencers(network: &Network, p: f64, sample_size: usize) -> HashSet<u64> { /* ... */ } //sample size is the number of users to sample to estimate the network size

```

**Scoring:**

The problem will be scored based on the correctness of the implemented functions, their efficiency (execution time and memory usage), and their ability to handle edge cases and large-scale networks. The approximate influencer identification will be evaluated based on the accuracy of the approximation.

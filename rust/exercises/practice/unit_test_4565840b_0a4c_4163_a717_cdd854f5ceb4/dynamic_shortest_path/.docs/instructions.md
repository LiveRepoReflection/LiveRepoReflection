## Question: Optimized Multi-Source Weighted Shortest Path Calculation on a Dynamic Graph

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with building a real-time analytics service for a large transportation network represented as a directed, weighted graph. The graph represents cities as nodes and transportation routes (roads, train lines, etc.) as edges. The weight of each edge represents the travel time along that route.

The service needs to efficiently answer queries for the shortest (fastest) path between a set of "source" cities and all other cities in the network. The system also needs to handle dynamic changes to the graph, i.e., edges can be added, removed, or have their weights modified in real-time.

**Input:**

1.  **Initial Graph Data:** A description of the initial transportation network. This will be provided as a list of edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(source_city_id, destination_city_id, weight)`. City IDs are positive integers.
2.  **Source Cities:** A list of city IDs representing the source cities for which shortest paths must be calculated.
3.  **Dynamic Updates:** A stream of update operations to the graph. Each update is one of the following types:
    *   `("add", source_city_id, destination_city_id, weight)`: Adds a new edge to the graph. If the edge already exists, this operation should be ignored.
    *   `("remove", source_city_id, destination_city_id)`: Removes an edge from the graph. If the edge does not exist, this operation should be ignored.
    *   `("update", source_city_id, destination_city_id, new_weight)`: Updates the weight of an existing edge. If the edge does not exist, this operation should be ignored.
4.  **Query:** A request to find the shortest path from any of the specified source cities to a target city (city ID).

**Output:**

For each query, return the length of the shortest path from *any* of the source cities to the target city. If no path exists from *any* of the source cities to the target city, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of cities and edges in the graph can be very large (up to 10<sup>6</sup> nodes and 10<sup>7</sup> edges).
*   The number of source cities can vary from 1 to 10<sup>3</sup>.
*   The weights of the edges are positive integers.
*   The number of update operations and queries can be very large (up to 10<sup>5</sup> each).
*   Update operations should be processed efficiently in a way to minimize their impact on query performance.
*   The algorithm should be as performant as possible in terms of time and memory complexity. Standard Dijkstra's algorithm might not be efficient enough to process a large number of queries, so you need to consider optimizing it or choosing a more appropriate algorithm.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement a data structure and algorithm to efficiently represent the transportation network and calculate shortest paths.
*   Implement a mechanism to process dynamic updates to the graph in real-time.
*   Implement a function to answer shortest path queries given the current state of the graph and the set of source cities.
*   The solution must be memory-efficient, considering the size of the graph.
*   The solution should aim for optimal time complexity for both update operations and query processing.
*   Consider multiple valid approaches with different trade-offs between update and query performance.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be judged based on:

*   **Correctness:** The solution must correctly compute the shortest paths for all test cases.
*   **Performance:** The solution must meet the performance requirements for large graphs and a large number of queries and updates.  Solutions that time out or exceed memory limits will be penalized.
*   **Code Quality:** The solution should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
*   **Algorithm Efficiency:** The choice of data structures and algorithms should be appropriate for the problem and optimized for performance.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

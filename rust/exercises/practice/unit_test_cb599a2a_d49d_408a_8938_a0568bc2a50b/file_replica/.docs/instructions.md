`DistributedFileReplica`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed file replica system. The system consists of `N` nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. The system must maintain multiple replicas of a single file across these nodes to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.

Your system must implement the following functionalities:

1.  **`store(node_id: usize, chunk_id: usize, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), String>`**: Stores a chunk of the file on the specified node. The file is divided into chunks, each identified by a unique `chunk_id` (usize). Data is a byte vector representing the content of the chunk. The function should return `Ok` if the store operation is successful, or `Err` with a descriptive error message if it fails (e.g., invalid node ID, chunk already exists on the node).

2.  **`fetch(node_id: usize, chunk_id: usize) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String>`**: Retrieves a chunk of the file from the specified node. Returns `Ok` with the data if the chunk is found on the node, or `Err` with a descriptive error message if it fails (e.g., invalid node ID, chunk not found).

3.  **`replicate(chunk_id: usize, replication_factor: usize) -> Result<Vec<usize>, String>`**: Replicates a given chunk of the file across the system.  `replication_factor` indicates how many replicas of the chunk should exist. The function should select `replication_factor` distinct nodes to store the chunk (including any existing nodes that already have the chunk). The selection process should strive to balance the load across all nodes.  The function returns `Ok` with a vector containing the IDs of all nodes that now store the chunk. Returns `Err` if the replication fails (e.g., `replication_factor` is greater than `N`, data for the `chunk_id` not available on any node, unable to find enough available nodes due to constraints, etc.). Implement strategies to handle node failures during replication. If failures occur, retry or select alternative nodes until replication succeeds (or a defined failure threshold is met).

4.  **`delete(chunk_id: usize) -> Result<(), String>`**: Deletes all replicas of a given chunk from all nodes. Returns `Ok` if the deletion is successful, or `Err` if it fails.

5.  **`recover(chunk_id: usize) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String>`**: Recovers a chunk from a set of available nodes, even if some nodes might be unavailable. If the chunk is available on multiple nodes, prioritize retrieving from the node with the lowest load (least number of chunks stored). In the event that any of the nodes are unavailable, the system should continue to try the other nodes until a valid replica of the chunk is retrieved. Return `Ok` with the retrieved data, or `Err` if the recovery fails (e.g., chunk not found on any available node after retries).

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Node Failure:** Nodes can fail at any time. Your system should be resilient to node failures during replication and recovery.
*   **Load Balancing:** The `replicate` function should distribute chunks evenly across nodes to prevent overload.
*   **Concurrency:** The system should be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.
*   **Efficiency:** Optimize for read and write performance. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
*   **Data Consistency:** You do *not* need to ensure strong consistency. Eventual consistency is acceptable.
*   **Error Handling:** Provide informative error messages for all failure cases.
*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement a fully distributed system, consider how your design would scale to a large number of nodes. The solution should be efficient enough to handle reasonably big N.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when handling large files or many chunks.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   Implement the system using Rust's concurrency features (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Arc`, channels).
*   Use appropriate error handling mechanisms (e.g., `Result`).
*   Write clear and concise code with good documentation.
*   Consider using external crates for data structures or concurrency primitives if necessary.

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles. It challenges the solver to consider various trade-offs and optimize for performance, reliability, and scalability.

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard level problem, focusing on graph algorithms, optimization, and real-world application.

### Problem Title:  Network Congestion Minimization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the data flow within a large-scale distributed network.  The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.  Data packets need to be transmitted between various pairs of nodes.  Each node has a limited processing capacity.

The network's topology is represented by an undirected graph, where edges represent communication links between nodes. Each link has a specific bandwidth capacity. The network also has a routing table that defines the route for each packet to travel from its source to its destination. Each route is a sequence of nodes that the packet must traverse.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum congestion on any single node in the network.  The congestion on a node is defined as the sum of the sizes of all data packets passing *through* that node.  A packet passes through a node if the node is part of the packet's route.

You are given the following inputs:

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= `n` <= 1000).
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples representing the undirected edges of the graph. Each tuple is of the form `(node1, node2, bandwidth)`, where `node1` and `node2` are the node numbers connected by the edge (0 <= `node1`, `node2` < `n`), and `bandwidth` is the capacity of the edge. (1 <= `bandwidth` <= 10000).
*   `packet_routes`: A vector of tuples representing the data packet routes. Each tuple is of the form `(source, destination, size)`, where `source` and `destination` are the source and destination node numbers (0 <= `source`, `destination` < `n`), and `size` is the size of the data packet (1 <= `size` <= 100).
*   `routing_table`: A HashMap where the key is a tuple of `(source, destination)` and the value is a `Vec<usize>` representing the ordered path from source to destination based on existing routing algorithms.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Valid Graph:** The input `edges` represents a valid undirected graph. There are no self-loops (edge from a node to itself), and no duplicate edges. All nodes are reachable from at least one other node.
2.  **Valid Routes:** The input `packet_routes` represents valid routes. The `source` and `destination` nodes are always valid nodes in the graph.
3.  **Routing Table Consistency:** The `routing_table` contains valid routes. For each `(source, destination)` pair in `packet_routes`, there exists a corresponding route in `routing_table`. The first node in the route should be the `source` and the last node should be the `destination`.
4.  **Optimization:** Your solution must minimize the *maximum* congestion across all nodes.
5.  **Efficiency:** Your algorithm must be efficient enough to handle large input graphs and a significant number of data packets.  Consider the time and space complexity of your solution.  Naive solutions that iterate through all packets for each node will likely time out.
6.  **Realistic Constraints:**  The network topology and traffic patterns are realistic. There might be bottlenecks in the network.
7.  **Handle Disconnected Graphs:** If the graph is disconnected, and a packet route exists between disconnected components, return `-1`.

**Function Signature:**

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn minimize_congestion(
    n: usize,
    edges: Vec<(usize, usize, i32)>,
    packet_routes: Vec<(usize, usize, i32)>,
    routing_table: HashMap<(usize, usize), Vec<usize>>,
) -> i32 {
    // Your code here
}
```

**Example:**

Let's imagine a very simple network:

*   `n = 3` (nodes 0, 1, 2)
*   `edges = [(0, 1, 100), (1, 2, 100)]`
*   `packet_routes = [(0, 2, 50)]`
*   `routing_table = {(0, 2): [0, 1, 2]}`

In this case, a packet of size 50 travels from node 0 to node 2, passing through nodes 0, 1, and 2. The congestion on nodes 0, 1, and 2 would all be 50. The maximum congestion would be 50.

**Challenge:**

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Consider using techniques like:

*   Graph representation (adjacency list or matrix)
*   Dijkstra's algorithm or similar shortest path algorithms (although the `routing_table` is provided, understanding how routes are derived is helpful)
*   Efficient data structures for tracking congestion
*   Optimization strategies to reduce the computational complexity

Good luck!

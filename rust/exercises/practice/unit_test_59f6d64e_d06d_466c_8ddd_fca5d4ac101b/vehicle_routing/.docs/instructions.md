Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test a programmer's skills in graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization.

## Project Name

`Autonomous-Vehicle-Routing`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing system for an autonomous vehicle fleet operating within a large, dynamically changing city.  The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments. Each road segment has a length (distance) and a dynamic congestion level (an integer from 0 to 100, representing percentage of maximum capacity).  Higher congestion levels translate to slower travel times.

The autonomous vehicles need to fulfill transportation requests between any two intersections in the city.  Each request comes with a deadline (timestamp). Your system needs to determine the optimal route for each vehicle to minimize a cost function, which is a weighted sum of travel time and the lateness penalty (amount of time the vehicle arrives after the deadline).

**Specifically, you need to implement the following function:**

```rust
fn find_optimal_route(
    graph: &CityGraph,
    start_intersection: IntersectionId,
    end_intersection: IntersectionId,
    request_deadline: Timestamp,
    current_time: Timestamp,
    lateness_penalty_weight: f64, // Weight applied to each unit of lateness.
) -> Option<Route>;
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **`IntersectionId`:** A `u32` representing a unique intersection identifier.
*   **`Timestamp`:** A `u64` representing a point in time (e.g., Unix timestamp in milliseconds).
*   **`CongestionLevel`:** A `u8` representing the congestion level of a road segment (0-100).
*   **`RoadSegment`:** Represents a road segment connecting two intersections.
    *   `from: IntersectionId`
    *   `to: IntersectionId`
    *   `length: f64` (distance in meters)
    *   `congestion: CongestionLevel`
*   **`CityGraph`:** Represents the city's road network.  This could be implemented using a `HashMap<IntersectionId, Vec<RoadSegment>>` or similar, but you are free to choose the most efficient representation.  It must provide a method to access the outgoing edges from a given intersection:
    *   `fn get_outgoing_edges(&self, intersection_id: IntersectionId) -> &[RoadSegment]`
*   **`Route`:** Represents a sequence of `IntersectionId`s representing the path the vehicle should take.
    *   `path: Vec<IntersectionId>`
    *   `total_travel_time: f64` (in seconds)
    *   `total_cost: f64` (weighted sum of travel time and lateness penalty)

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Dynamic Congestion:** The `CityGraph`'s `congestion` levels can change at any point in time. Assume that the `get_outgoing_edges` method always returns the *current* congestion levels. You should design your routing algorithm to be robust against these dynamic changes.
2.  **Real-time Performance:** The `find_optimal_route` function must execute within a reasonable time limit (e.g., under 100ms for a graph with up to 10,000 intersections). This is critical for a real-time routing system.
3.  **Cost Function:** The cost function is calculated as follows:

    `total_cost = total_travel_time + lateness_penalty_weight * max(0, arrival_time - request_deadline)`

    Where:

    *   `arrival_time = current_time + total_travel_time`
4.  **Variable Speed:** The travel time on a road segment is inversely proportional to the congestion level. Assume that at `congestion = 0`, the vehicle travels at its maximum speed (`MAX_SPEED = 30 m/s`).  The travel time for a road segment is calculated as:

    `travel_time = length / (MAX_SPEED * (1 - congestion / 100.0))`
5.  **Graph Size:** The city graph can be large, potentially containing thousands of intersections and road segments.
6.  **No Negative Cycles:** Assume the graph does not contain any negative cycles.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no route exists between the start and end intersections. Return `None` in such cases. Handle cases where the `start_intersection` and `end_intersection` are identical. Return a `Route` with only the single intersection in its path and zero travel time/cost.
8.  **Memory Efficiency:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large graphs. Avoid unnecessary cloning or copying of data.

**Optimization Hints:**

*   Consider using heuristics (e.g., A\*) to guide the search and improve performance.
*   Explore techniques for pruning the search space to avoid exploring unnecessary paths.
*   Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
*   Consider using more efficient data structures for storing the graph.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.  It challenges you to design a real-world routing system that balances performance, accuracy, and memory efficiency. Good luck!

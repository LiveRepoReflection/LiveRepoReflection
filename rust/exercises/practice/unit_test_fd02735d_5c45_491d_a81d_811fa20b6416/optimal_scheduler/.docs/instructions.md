## Question: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduler for a complex system. The system involves a set of `N` tasks, each represented by a unique integer ID from `0` to `N-1`. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   **Processing Time:** `time[i]` representing the time units required to complete the task.
*   **Deadline:** `deadline[i]` representing the time unit by which the task must be completed.  Missing the deadline incurs a penalty.
*   **Penalty:** `penalty[i]` representing the penalty incurred if the task is not completed by its deadline.
*   **Dependencies:** A list of task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start. These dependencies form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Your goal is to design a scheduling algorithm that minimizes the total penalty incurred due to missed deadlines.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Dependencies:** Tasks must be executed in an order that respects the dependencies defined by the DAG. A task cannot start until all its dependencies are finished.
2.  **Single Processor:** Only one task can be executed at any given time.
3.  **Non-preemptive:** Once a task starts, it must run to completion without interruption.
4.  **Large Scale:** The number of tasks `N` can be up to 100,000. Processing times, deadlines and penalties can be large numbers requiring careful consideration of integer overflow and memory usage.
5.  **Time Limit:** Your solution must execute within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 5 seconds).  Inefficient algorithms will time out.
6.  **Memory Limit:** Your solution must operate within a reasonable memory limit (e.g., 1GB). Excessive memory allocation will result in an out-of-memory error.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of tasks (integer).
*   `time`: A vector of `N` integers, where `time[i]` is the processing time of task `i`.
*   `deadline`: A vector of `N` integers, where `deadline[i]` is the deadline of task `i`.
*   `penalty`: A vector of `N` integers, where `penalty[i]` is the penalty for missing the deadline of task `i`.
*   `dependencies`: A vector of `N` vectors of integers, where `dependencies[i]` is a list of task IDs that must be completed before task `i` can start. `dependencies[i]` can be an empty vector if the task has no dependencies.

**Output:**

*   The minimum total penalty achievable by optimally scheduling the tasks (integer).

**Example:**

Let's say you have 3 tasks:

*   `N = 3`
*   `time = [2, 3, 2]` (Task 0 takes 2 units, Task 1 takes 3 units, Task 2 takes 2 units)
*   `deadline = [4, 6, 5]` (Task 0 must be done by time 4, Task 1 by time 6, Task 2 by time 5)
*   `penalty = [5, 8, 3]` (Penalty for missing Task 0 is 5, Task 1 is 8, Task 2 is 3)
*   `dependencies = [[], [0], [0, 1]]` (Task 1 depends on Task 0, Task 2 depends on Task 0 and Task 1)

One possible schedule is:

1.  Task 0 (Time 0-2)
2.  Task 1 (Time 2-5)
3.  Task 2 (Time 5-7)

In this schedule, Task 2 misses its deadline of 5, incurring a penalty of 3. Tasks 0 and 1 are completed on time. The total penalty is 3.

Another possible schedule is:

1. Task 0 (Time 0-2)
2. Task 2 (Time 2-4)
3. Task 1 (Time 4-7)

In this schedule, Task 1 misses its deadline of 6, incurring a penalty of 8. The total penalty is 8.

The optimal schedule is the first one with a total penalty of 3.

**Challenge:**

Find an algorithm that can handle a large number of tasks and complex dependencies to determine the optimal task schedule that minimizes the total penalty. Consider the computational complexity of your algorithm and optimize it for efficiency. Explore different algorithmic approaches, such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or branch and bound, and analyze their trade-offs in terms of time complexity, memory usage, and optimality. The constraints on time and memory are strict, requiring careful optimization.

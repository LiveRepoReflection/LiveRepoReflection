`FaultTolerantGraph`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed system for managing a large, dynamic graph. This graph represents relationships between entities in a social network. Due to the distributed nature of the system and potential network instability, nodes (representing entities and their relationships) can become temporarily unavailable. The system must be resilient to these node failures and continue to provide accurate and consistent graph data.

Specifically, you need to implement a `FaultTolerantGraph` struct in Rust that provides the following functionalities:

1.  **Node Representation:** Each node in the graph is identified by a unique `NodeId` (a `u64`). Each node has a data payload of type `String`.

2.  **Edge Representation:** Edges are directed and connect two `NodeId`s. The graph allows multiple edges between the same two nodes. Each edge has a data payload of type `String`.

3.  **Dynamic Graph:** The graph should support adding and removing nodes and edges.

4.  **Node Availability:** The system simulates node failures. Implement a mechanism to mark a node as "unavailable". Unavailable nodes should not participate in graph traversals or calculations. The system should allow nodes to be marked as available again.

5.  **Approximate Shortest Path:** Implement a function `approximate_shortest_path(start_node: NodeId, end_node: NodeId, max_hops: u32) -> Option<Vec<NodeId>>`. This function should find *an* approximate shortest path (not necessarily *the* shortest) between two given nodes, considering only available nodes. The path should not exceed `max_hops`. If no path is found within the hop limit, it should return `None`. The approximation arises from the requirement that unavailable nodes are completely skipped when searching for the shortest path.

6.  **Data Consistency under Failure:** Even when nodes are unavailable, the system must maintain data consistency. Specifically, when a node becomes available again, its relationships (edges) should be restored correctly.

7.  **Optimized Traversal:** The graph can be very large. Implement the shortest path algorithm efficiently, considering memory usage and execution time.  Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize graph traversal.

8.  **Edge Case Handling:** The system should handle edge cases gracefully, such as:
    *   Requesting a path to a non-existent node.
    *   Requesting a path between the same node.
    *   Adding/removing edges to/from non-existent nodes.
    *   Marking a non-existent node as available/unavailable.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes can be very large (up to 1 million).
*   The number of edges can be even larger (up to 10 million).
*   The `approximate_shortest_path` function should have reasonable performance, even on large graphs.  Avoid naive implementations that iterate through the entire graph for each pathfinding request.
*   The implementation must be memory-efficient.  Avoid storing redundant data.
*   The solution should be thread-safe, allowing concurrent access to the graph from multiple threads (especially for read operations like `approximate_shortest_path`).  Use appropriate synchronization primitives where necessary.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism to persist the graph data to disk and load it back, maintaining node availability status.
*   Implement a more sophisticated shortest path approximation algorithm, such as A\* search with a heuristic function that estimates the distance to the target node, taking into consideration the distribution of unavailable nodes.
*   Implement a distributed consensus mechanism to ensure consistency of node availability status across multiple replicas of the graph.

This problem requires a strong understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, concurrency, and system design principles. It also emphasizes the importance of performance optimization and error handling in real-world distributed systems.

Okay, here's a hard-level Rust coding problem designed to be challenging and sophisticated, touching on multiple areas you requested.

**Problem Title:** Network Packet Routing Optimization

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an efficient routing algorithm for a data network. The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n-1`. Each node represents a router. The connections between routers are represented by a list of bidirectional edges. Each edge has a latency associated with it, representing the time it takes for a packet to travel between the connected routers.

Your goal is to implement a function that, given the network topology, a source node, a destination node, and a packet size, determines the optimal path for routing a packet between the source and destination nodes.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The network topology is represented as an adjacency list where the key is the Node ID, and the value is a `Vec<(NodeId, Latency)>` to represent connected nodes. `NodeId` is `usize` and `Latency` is `u64`.
2.  **Optimal Path:** The "optimal path" is defined as the path that minimizes the **total latency** *plus* a **congestion penalty**.
3.  **Congestion Penalty:** The congestion penalty for each edge is calculated as `(packet_size_bytes / edge_bandwidth_bytes_per_second) * latency`. Each edge now has an associated bandwidth.

    *   If bandwidth for an edge is not provided, assume a default bandwidth of 1000 bytes per second.
4.  **Bandwidth Representation:** Assume each node stores the bandwidth associated with connections, represented as a `HashMap<(NodeId, NodeId), u64>`. If bandwidth is not present, use the default.
5.  **Packet Loss:** During traversal, there is a `packet_loss_probability` associated with each node. If a packet is lost, the packet is resent from the origin. This creates a performance overhead. The packet loss probability is also stored as a `HashMap<NodeId, f64>`. If not present, assume a default `packet_loss_probability` of 0.0 (no packet loss).
6.  **Dijkstra with Modifications:** You *must* use Dijkstra's algorithm as a foundation, but you'll need to adapt it to incorporate the congestion penalty and packet loss overhead into the cost function.
7.  **Optimization:**  The network can be large (up to 10,000 nodes), and packet sizes can vary significantly (1 byte to 1 MB).  Therefore, your implementation must be highly efficient. Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., a priority queue with efficient update operations).
8.  **Error Handling:** If no path exists between the source and destination, return `None`.
9.  **Floating Point Precision:** Be mindful of potential floating point precision issues when calculating the overall cost. Use appropriate techniques to mitigate inaccuracies.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (usize).
*   `edges`: A `Vec<(usize, usize, u64)>` representing the bidirectional edges in the network. Each tuple is `(node1, node2, latency)`.
*   `source`: The source node (usize).
*   `destination`: The destination node (usize).
*   `packet_size_bytes`: The size of the packet to be routed, in bytes (u64).
*   `edge_bandwidths`: A `HashMap<(usize, usize), u64>` representing the bandwidth (bytes per second) for each edge.
*   `packet_loss_probabilities`: A `HashMap<usize, f64>` representing the packet loss probability associated with a node.

**Output:**

*   `Option<(u64, Vec<usize>)>`:  `Some((total_cost, path))`, where `total_cost` is the total cost (latency + congestion penalty + packet loss overhead) of the optimal path, and `path` is a `Vec<usize>` representing the sequence of nodes in the optimal path (including the source and destination). Return `None` if no path exists.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `n` <= 10,000
*   0 <= `source` < `n`
*   0 <= `destination` < `n`
*   1 <= `packet_size_bytes` <= 1,000,000 (1MB)
*   0 <= `latency` <= 1000
*   0 <= `bandwidth` <= 1,000,000,000 (1GB)
*   0.0 <= `packet_loss_probability` < 1.0
*   The graph may not be fully connected.

**Example:**

```rust
// Example Input (Illustrative)
let n = 5;
let edges = vec![(0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 15), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 20), (2, 4, 10), (3, 4, 5)];
let source = 0;
let destination = 4;
let packet_size_bytes = 1000;
let edge_bandwidths: HashMap<(usize, usize), u64> = HashMap::from([((0, 1), 500), ((1, 0), 500)]);
let packet_loss_probabilities: HashMap<usize, f64> = HashMap::from([(1, 0.1)]);
```

This problem requires a solid understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm, graph theory, data structures, and the ability to optimize for performance. Good luck!

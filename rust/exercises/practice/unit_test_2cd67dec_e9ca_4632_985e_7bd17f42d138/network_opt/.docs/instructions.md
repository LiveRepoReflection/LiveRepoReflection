Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Rust problem description:

## Project Name

`NetworkTopologyOptimization`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an efficient communication network between a set of servers. The network is represented as a graph where servers are nodes and communication links between them are edges.  Each server has a specific processing capacity, and each communication link has a certain bandwidth.  The goal is to find the minimum cost network topology that satisfies specific performance requirements for data transfer between all pairs of servers.

**Input:**

*   `servers`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a server and contains:
    *   `id`: A unique integer identifier for the server.
    *   `capacity`: An integer representing the processing capacity of the server.
*   `traffic_demands`: A HashMap where the key is a tuple of two server IDs (source, destination), and the value is the integer representing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between them. The HashMap is symmetric (i.e., if (A, B) exists, (B, A) also exists with the same value).
*   `link_costs`: A HashMap where the key is a tuple of two server IDs (server1, server2), and the value is the integer representing the cost of establishing a communication link between them. The HashMap is symmetric (i.e., if (A, B) exists, (B, A) also exists with the same value). The presence of a key in this HashMap indicates a potential link that *can* be built, but doesn't mean it *must* be built.
*   `bandwidth_per_link`: An integer representing the bandwidth of a single communication link

**Output:**

*   A `Result<HashSet<(u32, u32)>, String>` representing the optimal network topology. The `HashSet` contains tuples of server IDs representing the communication links (edges) to be established in the optimal network. The order of IDs in the tuple does not matter (e.g., (A, B) is the same as (B, A)). If no solution exists, return `Err` with a descriptive error message.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Connectivity:** All servers must be able to communicate with each other, directly or indirectly, through the established network.
2.  **Capacity:** For each server, the total incoming and outgoing traffic must not exceed its processing capacity.  You need to route traffic along the established links.
3.  **Bandwidth:** For each communication link, the total traffic flowing through it in both directions must not exceed its bandwidth. You need to determine the traffic flow on each link.
4.  **Minimization:** The total cost of the established network (sum of the costs of the established links from `link_costs`) must be minimized.
5.  **Efficiency:**  Your solution must be efficient enough to handle a network with up to 100 servers and 500 potential links within a reasonable time (e.g., a few seconds).
6.  **Traffic Routing:**  You are free to choose any traffic routing algorithm (e.g., shortest path, multi-path routing), but your choice must guarantee that all traffic demands are met and the capacity and bandwidth constraints are satisfied.  Justify your choice of traffic routing in comments.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases gracefully, such as:
    *   Empty server list.
    *   No possible links.
    *   Traffic demands that cannot be satisfied due to capacity or bandwidth limitations.
    *   Disconnected graph scenarios when constraints cannot be met.
8.  **Valid Input:** You can assume that the input data is valid (e.g., server IDs in `traffic_demands` and `link_costs` exist in the `servers` list, link costs are non-negative, etc.).
9.  **Symmetry:** The traffic demands and link costs are symmetric, meaning that the cost of link (A, B) is the same as (B, A), and the traffic demand between (A, B) is the same as (B, A). Your solution should handle this symmetry efficiently.
10. **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If multiple network topologies have the same minimal cost, you can return any one of them.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using graph algorithms like Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) as a starting point, but remember that MST does not account for capacity and bandwidth constraints, so it might not be the optimal solution.
*   Consider using a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques (e.g., branch and bound, simulated annealing), and heuristics to find the optimal solution within the given time constraints.
*   Careful data structure selection is crucial for efficiency.
*   Think about how to represent the traffic flow through the network.
*   Prioritize correctness and handle all edge cases before focusing on optimization.
*   Document your assumptions and justify your design choices in comments.
*   Consider using a flow network concept to model the problem and leverage max-flow min-cut theorem as a way to check feasibility of a given network topology.

This problem requires a combination of graph theory knowledge, optimization skills, and careful implementation to achieve a correct and efficient solution. Good luck!

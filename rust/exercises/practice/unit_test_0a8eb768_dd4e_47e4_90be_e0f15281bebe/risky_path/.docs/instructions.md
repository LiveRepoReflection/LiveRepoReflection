## Question: Minimal Risk Pathfinding with Dynamic Obstacles

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing a pathfinding algorithm for a robot navigating a dynamic warehouse environment. The warehouse is represented as a grid, and the robot needs to travel from a starting cell to a destination cell while minimizing the risk of collision with moving obstacles.

**Warehouse Representation:**

*   The warehouse is a grid of size `rows x cols`, where each cell is represented by its row and column indices (0-indexed).
*   Each cell can be either empty (represented by `.`) or blocked by static obstacles (represented by `#`).
*   The robot can only move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) in each time step. Diagonal movements are not allowed.

**Dynamic Obstacles:**

*   The warehouse contains `N` dynamic obstacles (other robots or automated vehicles).
*   Each obstacle has a predefined path, represented as a sequence of cells it will occupy at each time step. The path can contain loops or cycles.
*   The obstacles move synchronously with the robot, meaning that at each time step, all entities (the robot and all obstacles) move simultaneously.
*   A collision occurs if the robot and any obstacle occupy the same cell at the same time step.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   Each cell in the grid has an associated risk value, represented by a non-negative integer. This risk value signifies the potential damage if a collision occurs in that cell.
*   The total risk of a path is the sum of the risk values of the cells where the robot *almost* collides with an obstacle. An *almost* collision is defined as being adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to an obstacle in the same time step. Diagonal adjacency does not count as *almost* collision.
*   The goal is to find a path from the start cell to the destination cell that minimizes the total risk.

**Constraints:**

1.  The robot must reach the destination within a maximum of `T` time steps. If it cannot reach the destination within `T` steps, return `None`.
2.  The robot cannot occupy a cell with a static obstacle (`#`).
3.  The robot cannot collide with any dynamic obstacle.
4.  The start and destination cells are guaranteed to be empty and free of static obstacles.
5.  The start and destination are not the same cell.

**Input:**

*   `grid`: A `Vec<Vec<char>>` representing the warehouse grid.
*   `risk_grid`: A `Vec<Vec<i32>>` representing the risk value for each cell.
*   `obstacle_paths`: A `Vec<Vec<(usize, usize)>>` representing the paths of the dynamic obstacles. Each element of the outer vector is the path for a single obstacle, and each element of the inner vector is a tuple `(row, col)` representing the cell occupied by that obstacle at a specific time step.  The length of each inner `Vec<(usize, usize)>` can be different, representing paths of different lengths. An obstacle repeats its path from the beginning if the robot's maximum time `T` exceeds the obstacle's path length.
*   `start`: A tuple `(usize, usize)` representing the starting cell of the robot.
*   `destination`: A tuple `(usize, usize)` representing the destination cell of the robot.
*   `T`: An integer representing the maximum number of time steps.

**Output:**

*   Return an `Option<Vec<(usize, usize)>>` representing the optimal path from the start cell to the destination cell, minimizing the total risk. If no path exists within the time limit `T`, return `None`.  The path should include the start and destination cells, and each cell in the path represents the robot's position at each time step.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   The algorithm should be efficient enough to handle large grids and a significant number of dynamic obstacles. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Consider the case where the start and destination cells are adjacent.
*   Consider the case where the destination is unreachable due to static or dynamic obstacles.
*   Consider the case where multiple paths exist with the same minimum risk. The algorithm can return any of these paths.
*   Obstacle paths can have varying lengths and can be shorter than T, in which case they loop.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, dynamic programming, and optimization techniques to find the optimal solution within the given constraints. Good luck!

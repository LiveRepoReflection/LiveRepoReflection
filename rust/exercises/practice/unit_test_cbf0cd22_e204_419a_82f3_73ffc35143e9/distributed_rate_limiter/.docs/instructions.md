Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem:

## Project Name

`DistributedRateLimiter`

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter system. This system should control the rate at which clients can access a protected resource, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're building a popular API service. You need to protect it from being overwhelmed by excessive requests from individual clients. You want to implement a rate limiter that restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specific time window. However, your service is distributed across multiple servers, making a simple in-memory rate limiter insufficient.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Counting:** The rate limiter must accurately track request counts across multiple servers. If a client makes requests that are handled by different servers, the rate limiter should still correctly identify and limit the client's overall request rate.
2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limit should be configurable, allowing you to specify the maximum number of requests allowed per client within a given time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour).
3.  **Client Identification:** The system must reliably identify clients. You can assume each client has a unique identifier (e.g., an API key or a user ID).
4.  **Atomic Operations:** All operations related to incrementing request counts and checking rate limits must be atomic to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
5.  **Expiration:** The rate limiter should automatically expire request counts after the configured time window has elapsed. This prevents the accumulation of outdated request data.
6.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter must be efficient, with minimal overhead, to avoid impacting the overall performance of your service.  Minimize latency for checking and incrementing the request count.
7.  **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of clients and high request volumes.
8.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple clients without data corruption.

**Constraints:**

*   **External Storage:** The rate limiter *must* use an external, persistent storage system to maintain request counts across the distributed environment. You can assume the availability of a key-value store like Redis.
*   **No Centralized Counter:** You are **not** allowed to use a single, centralized counter for each client. Distribute the counting to avoid bottlenecks.
*   **Time Synchronization:** Assume that all servers have reasonably synchronized clocks.
*   **Resource Usage:** Be mindful of the memory footprint. Avoid storing large amounts of data in memory.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for cases where the storage system is unavailable or encounters errors.

**Specific Implementation Details:**

*   Provide a `RateLimiter` struct with methods for:
    *   `new(redis_url: &str, requests_per_window: u64, time_window_seconds: u64) -> Result<RateLimiter, Error>`:  Initializes the rate limiter, connecting to the specified Redis instance and setting the rate limit parameters.
    *   `is_allowed(client_id: &str) -> Result<bool, Error>`: Checks if the client is allowed to make a request based on the current rate limit.  If allowed, it increments the client's request count. If not allowed, it returns `false` without incrementing.
*   Use Redis (or a similar key-value store) to store request counts for each client.
*   Design your key schema in Redis carefully to efficiently store and retrieve request counts. Consider using a combination of client ID and time window to create unique keys.
*   Implement logic to automatically expire Redis keys after the time window has elapsed.  Leverage Redis's TTL (Time To Live) functionality.
*   Use appropriate Redis commands for atomic increment operations.  Consider using Redis scripting for more complex atomic operations.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a "leaky bucket" algorithm for smoother rate limiting.
*   Add support for different rate limits based on client tiers (e.g., free vs. paid).
*   Implement metrics and monitoring to track the performance of the rate limiter.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. It challenges you to think about how to design a robust and scalable rate limiter that can handle the demands of a modern API service. Good luck!

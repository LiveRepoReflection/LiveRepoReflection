Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Rust coding problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Decentralized Order Book Aggregation

**Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a system for aggregating and querying decentralized order books from multiple exchanges. In a decentralized setting, order books are not centrally managed, but rather exist as separate entities on different nodes within a peer-to-peer network. This creates a challenge of efficiently querying and combining data from these disparate sources.

Specifically, you need to implement a system that can:

1.  **Connect to multiple order book providers (simulated as functions returning order book snapshots).** Each provider may have different network latency and varying data availability.
2.  **Aggregate orders from all providers into a single, consistent view of the order book.**
3.  **Efficiently respond to queries for the best bid and ask prices (top of the book).**
4.  **Support filtering orders based on price and quantity.**
5.  **Handle asynchronous data updates from providers.** The system should continuously update the aggregated order book as new data becomes available.
6.  **Tolerate provider failures.** If a provider becomes unavailable, the system should continue to function using data from the remaining providers.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Order:** Represents a single order in the order book. It has a price, quantity, and a `provider_id` (to track the source of the order).
*   **OrderBook:** Represents the aggregated order book, containing separate collections of bids and asks.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Performance:**  The system must be able to handle a high volume of order book updates and queries with low latency. Aim for sub-millisecond response times for top-of-book queries under moderate load.
*   **Concurrency:** The system must be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to provider failures.  Implement graceful degradation when a provider becomes unavailable.
*   **Scalability:** Consider how the system could be scaled to handle a large number of providers and orders.
*   **Asynchronous Updates:** Providers push updates asynchronously. The system needs to efficiently integrate these updates into the aggregated order book without blocking queries.
*   **Data Consistency:** While perfect consistency is difficult in a decentralized environment, strive to minimize inconsistencies in the aggregated order book. Implement a strategy to handle potentially conflicting data from different providers (e.g., using timestamps or other conflict resolution mechanisms).

**Input:**

*   A list of provider IDs (e.g., strings or integers).
*   A function that takes a provider ID and returns a `Result<Vec<Order>, Error>` representing an order book snapshot.  This function simulates connecting to a remote data source. The function may return an error to simulate provider unavailability.
*   Query requests for the best bid/ask price, or filtered order lists.

**Output:**

*   The best bid and ask prices (top of the book).
*   Filtered lists of orders matching the query criteria.

**Example Queries:**

*   `get_top_of_book()` -> `Result<(Option<Price>, Option<Price>), Error>` (Returns the best bid and ask prices)
*   `get_orders(min_price: Price, max_price: Price, min_quantity: Quantity)` -> `Result<Vec<Order>, Error>` (Returns a list of orders that fall within the specified price and quantity range)

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement order prioritization within the aggregated order book (e.g., based on provider reputation or timestamp).
*   Add support for subscribing to real-time order book updates.
*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and handling stale data.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, concurrency, error handling, and optimization techniques.  Good luck!

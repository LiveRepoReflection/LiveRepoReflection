`Autonomous Vehicle Routing with Dynamic Obstacles`

## Question Description

You are tasked with developing the routing algorithm for an autonomous vehicle navigating a dynamic environment. The vehicle needs to travel from a designated start location to a target destination on a map represented as a weighted graph. The challenge lies in the fact that obstacles (represented as dynamically appearing and disappearing nodes with associated cost penalties) may appear and disappear during the vehicle's traversal.

**Graph Representation:**

The map is represented as a directed weighted graph where:

*   Nodes represent locations.
*   Edges represent roads connecting locations.
*   Edge weights represent the travel cost (e.g., time, fuel consumption) to traverse that road.

**Dynamic Obstacles:**

At any given time step, certain nodes may become blocked (obstacles) or unblocked. Each blocked node incurs a penalty cost *for each edge that uses it*. This penalty is added to the total cost of any path traversing an edge connected to the blocked node.

**Objective:**

Implement an algorithm that efficiently finds the lowest-cost path from the starting node to the destination node, taking into account the dynamic obstacle states. Your algorithm must be able to adapt to changes in obstacle states during the path-finding process.

**Input:**

*   `graph`: A data structure representing the directed weighted graph.  This could be an adjacency list or matrix. The graph should be mutable to allow for dynamic changes.
*   `start_node`: The ID of the starting node.
*   `destination_node`: The ID of the destination node.
*   `obstacle_states`: A stream or sequence of events. Each event describes a change in the obstacle status of a specific node at a specific time. Each event will be represented as a tuple `(time, node_id, is_blocked)`, where `time` represents the time at which the obstacle changes, `node_id` is the node whose status changes, and `is_blocked` is a boolean indicating whether the node becomes blocked (`true`) or unblocked (`false`).  The obstacle states are provided in increasing order of time.
*   `obstacle_penalty`: The penalty cost incurred when traversing an edge connected to a blocked node.

**Output:**

The algorithm should return a list of node IDs representing the lowest-cost path from the `start_node` to the `destination_node`, considering the dynamic obstacle states. If no path exists, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can be large (e.g., thousands of nodes and edges).
*   The number of obstacle state changes can be significant.
*   The algorithm must find a reasonably optimal path efficiently.  Brute-force approaches will not be feasible.
*   The graph can contain cycles.
*   Multiple paths may exist, and the algorithm should return one with the minimum cost.
*   The obstacle state changes must be processed in the order they are received from the `obstacle_states` input.
*   If, at a given time, multiple shortest paths exist, any one of them can be returned.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize the computational cost of re-routing when obstacle states change.  Recomputing the entire shortest path from scratch after each change is likely too slow.
*   Consider using heuristics or approximations to improve performance, but be mindful of the trade-off between speed and path optimality.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a simple graph with nodes {A, B, C, D}, and the task is to travel from A to D. Initially, all nodes are unblocked. The obstacle states might then indicate that B becomes blocked at time 5, and unblocked at time 10. Your algorithm should adapt the route accordingly.  If the initial shortest path was A -> B -> D, the algorithm should find an alternate route (e.g., A -> C -> D) after time 5, and potentially revert back to A -> B -> D after time 10 if that becomes the shortest path again.

**Judging Criteria:**

The solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:** The path returned must be a valid path from the start node to the destination node, and it must correctly account for the obstacle states.
*   **Optimality:** The path returned should be the lowest-cost path possible, or a reasonably close approximation, given the obstacle states.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be able to handle large graphs and a significant number of obstacle state changes within a reasonable time limit.
*   **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.

This problem requires a deep understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

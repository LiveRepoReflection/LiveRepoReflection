Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem description.

## Project Name

`NetworkSim`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building a network simulator that models packet routing in a simplified network topology. The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. The network's topology is defined by a set of bidirectional connections, where each connection has a specific bandwidth capacity.

Your simulator must handle the following events:

1.  **Connection Creation:** Establish a bidirectional connection between two nodes with a specified bandwidth.
2.  **Connection Removal:** Remove an existing bidirectional connection between two nodes.
3.  **Packet Transmission:** Transmit a packet of a certain size from a source node to a destination node.

**Core Requirements:**

*   **Routing:** Implement a dynamic routing algorithm that determines the path a packet takes from source to destination. The algorithm should prioritize paths with the highest available bandwidth. If multiple paths have the same bandwidth, the path with the fewest hops should be chosen.
*   **Bandwidth Management:** Each connection has a limited bandwidth capacity. Packet transmissions must adhere to these limits. If a path's available bandwidth is insufficient to transmit the entire packet at once, the packet must be split into smaller chunks and transmitted sequentially.
*   **Congestion Handling:** If no path with sufficient bandwidth exists, the packet transmission should fail gracefully (without panicking).
*   **Real-Time Simulation:** Model the transmission time of a packet based on the path's bandwidth and the packet size. Assume that transmission time is inversely proportional to bandwidth.
*   **Event Logging:** Maintain a log of all events, including connection creations, removals, successful packet transmissions (including the path taken and transmission time), and failed packet transmissions (including the reason for failure).

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the network can be up to `1000`.
*   The bandwidth capacity of each connection can be up to `10000`.
*   The packet size can be up to `10000`.
*   The number of connections and packet transmissions can be large.
*   The simulation should be as efficient as possible in terms of both time and memory.
*   The routing algorithm must adapt to changes in network topology and bandwidth availability.
*   You must use appropriate data structures to represent the network topology, bandwidth capacities, and event log.
*   You should not use any external crates for graph algorithms (e.g., `petgraph`). You must implement the routing algorithm yourself.

**Input:**

The input will consist of a series of commands, each on a new line:

*   `connect <node1> <node2> <bandwidth>`: Creates a connection between `node1` and `node2` with the given `bandwidth`.
*   `remove <node1> <node2>`: Removes the connection between `node1` and `node2`.
*   `transmit <source> <destination> <packet_size>`: Transmits a packet of `packet_size` from `source` to `destination`.

**Output:**

For each `transmit` command, output either:

*   `success <path> <transmission_time>`: If the transmission is successful, output the path taken (a space-separated list of node IDs) and the total transmission time (a floating-point number with two decimal places).
*   `failure <reason>`: If the transmission fails, output "failure" followed by a reason (e.g., "no path", "insufficient bandwidth").

**Example:**

```
connect 0 1 100
connect 1 2 50
transmit 0 2 75
remove 1 2
transmit 0 2 75
```

Possible Output:

```
success 0 1 2 1.50
failure no path
```

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Consider using efficient data structures for storing the graph and bandwidth information. Adjacency lists or matrices could be appropriate, depending on the expected density of the network.
*   Optimize the routing algorithm to find the best path quickly. Consider using variations of Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search, adapted to prioritize bandwidth.
*   Minimize memory allocations and deallocations during the simulation.

**System Design Aspects:**

*   Think about how to represent the network topology and bandwidth capacities in a way that is both efficient and easy to update.
*   Consider how to handle concurrent packet transmissions if you want to extend the simulator in the future.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and performance optimization in Rust. Good luck!

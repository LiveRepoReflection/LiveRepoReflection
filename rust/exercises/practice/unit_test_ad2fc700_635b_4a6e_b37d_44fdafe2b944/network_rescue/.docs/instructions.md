Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Rust coding problem. Here's the description:

## Question Description

A critical network infrastructure has been compromised. The attacker has disrupted the network's routing tables, leading to widespread packet loss and service unavailability. Your task is to design and implement an efficient algorithm in Rust to rebuild the network's routing tables, enabling communication between all operational nodes.

The network consists of `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. You are given the following information:

*   **Node Status:** A `Vec<bool>` of length `n`, where `node_status[i]` indicates whether node `i` is operational (`true`) or compromised (`false`). Compromised nodes cannot participate in routing.
*   **Initial Connectivity:** A `Vec<(usize, usize, u32)>` representing the initial direct connections between nodes. Each tuple `(u, v, cost)` indicates a direct, bidirectional connection between node `u` and node `v` with a cost of `cost`. `cost` represents the latency of transmitting a packet through the link.
*   **Minimum Required Nodes:** An integer `k` representing the minimum number of operational nodes required for the network to be considered recoverable. If the number of operational nodes is less than `k`, the network cannot be recovered.
*   **Maximum Path Cost:** An integer `max_path_cost` that represent the largest acceptable latency cost to send a packet between two nodes.

Your task is to implement a function `recover_network` that takes the `node_status`, `initial_connectivity`, `k`, and `max_path_cost` as input and returns an `Option<Vec<Vec<Option<u32>>>>`.

The return value represents the recovered routing table. It is a `Vec<Vec<Option<u32>>>` of size `n x n`, where `routing_table[i][j]` is `Some(cost)` if there is a valid path (respecting `max_path_cost`) from node `i` to node `j` with a cost of `cost`, and `None` if there is no such path.

If the network cannot be recovered (i.e., the number of operational nodes is less than `k`, or it's impossible to build a routing table connecting all operational nodes within the cost constraint), return `None`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 500`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= cost <= 1000`
*   `1 <= k <= n`
*   `1 <= max_path_cost <= 1000000`
*   The graph represented by `initial_connectivity` may not be fully connected.
*   There might be multiple paths between two nodes; you should find the path with the *minimum* cost.
*   The input data can be sparse or dense.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be efficient enough to handle large networks (up to `n = 500`) within a reasonable time limit (e.g., a few seconds). Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to minimize time complexity. Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be a good start.
*   Avoid unnecessary computations. Only compute paths between operational nodes.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Handle disconnected networks gracefully.
*   Handle cases where all nodes are compromised.
*   Handle cases where `initial_connectivity` is empty.
*   Handle cases where there are no paths between nodes with a cost less than or equal to `max_path_cost`.
*   Be wary of Integer Overflows when calculating path costs.

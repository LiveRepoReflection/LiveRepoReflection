Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be at a "LeetCode Hard" level, focusing on efficiency, edge cases, and advanced data structures.

**Problem Title:** Efficient Network Router Simulation

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with simulating a network router's packet forwarding behavior. The router manages a network of interconnected nodes (represented as integers from `0` to `n-1`), and your goal is to implement an efficient algorithm for determining the optimal path for packets to travel between any two nodes.

The network topology is represented by a weighted, undirected graph.  The weights represent the cost (e.g., latency, bandwidth usage) of sending a packet directly between two connected nodes.

The router needs to handle a large number of packet forwarding requests concurrently. Each request specifies a source node, a destination node, and a maximum acceptable cost for the path.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Representation:** Implement a suitable data structure to represent the network graph. Consider memory usage and lookup speed. You need to support adding edges and retrieving neighbor information.

2.  **Optimal Path Finding:** Implement an algorithm that efficiently finds the lowest-cost path between a given source and destination node. Use a well-known algorithm that is suitable for weighted graph traversal.

3.  **Cost Constraint:** For each packet forwarding request, determine if a path exists from the source to the destination node with a total cost that is *less than or equal to* the maximum acceptable cost. If such a path exists, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

4.  **Concurrency:** The router must handle many concurrent packet forwarding requests. Design your solution to support this.

5.  **Efficiency:**  The solution must be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.  The graph can be large (up to 10,000 nodes and 50,000 edges), and there can be a large number of concurrent requests (up to 100,000).  Solutions with high time complexity will likely time out.

6.  **Edge Cases:** Handle the following edge cases:
    *   Disconnected graph: If there is no path between the source and destination, return `false`.
    *   Invalid node IDs:  If the source or destination node ID is out of range (less than 0 or greater than or equal to `n`), the request should be ignored and return `false`.
    *   Self-loops: The graph may contain edges from a node to itself. These should be handled appropriately.
    *   Zero-cost edges: The graph may contain edges with a cost of 0.
    *   Duplicate edges: The graph will not contain duplicate edges.

7.  **API:** You need to implement the following function:

```rust
fn can_reach_destination(
    num_nodes: usize,
    edges: &[(usize, usize, u32)], // (node1, node2, cost)
    source: usize,
    destination: usize,
    max_cost: u32,
) -> bool {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Where:

*   `num_nodes`: The total number of nodes in the network.
*   `edges`: A slice of tuples representing the edges in the graph. Each tuple contains the IDs of the two connected nodes and the cost of the edge.
*   `source`: The ID of the source node.
*   `destination`: The ID of the destination node.
*   `max_cost`: The maximum acceptable cost for the path.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_nodes <= 10,000`
*   `0 <= edges.len() <= 50,000`
*   `0 <= edges[i].0, edges[i].1 < num_nodes`
*   `0 <= edges[i].2 <= 1000` (Edge cost)
*   `0 <= source, destination < num_nodes`
*   `0 <= max_cost <= 1,000,000`

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Consider using a priority queue to efficiently explore the graph.
*   Think about how to optimize memory usage, especially for large graphs.
*   Explore techniques for handling concurrency effectively, such as using threads or an asynchronous runtime.
*   Pre-calculate the graph for all edges before handling the requests.

This problem requires a solid understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and concurrency in Rust. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to craft a challenging Rust coding problem. Here it is:

## Project Name

`distributed-transaction-manager`

## Question Description

You are tasked with building a simplified, in-memory Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) for a microservice architecture. This DTM will be responsible for ensuring the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across multiple services during distributed transactions.

In a real-world scenario, this would involve persistent storage, network communication, and complex conflict resolution. However, for this problem, we'll focus on the core logic within a single process, using in-memory data structures to represent the state of the transactions and resources.

**System Architecture:**

Imagine a system with multiple services (e.g., `InventoryService`, `PaymentService`, `ShippingService`). Each service manages its own resources (e.g., inventory count, account balance, shipping status). To perform a complex operation that requires changes across these services, a distributed transaction is initiated via the DTM.

**Your Task:**

Implement the core functionality of the `DistributedTransactionManager` struct. It should support the following operations:

1.  **`begin_transaction()`**: Starts a new distributed transaction and returns a unique transaction ID (`TxId`). The transaction should start in a `Pending` state.

2.  **`register_resource(tx_id: TxId, resource_id: ResourceId, service_id: ServiceId)`**: Registers a resource (identified by `ResourceId`) within a specific service (`ServiceId`) as participating in the transaction `tx_id`. You should keep track of all resources registered in each transaction. A service can be represented by a string, such as `"InventoryService"`.

3.  **`prepare(tx_id: TxId)`**: Simulates the "prepare" phase.  For simplicity, assume that *all* registered resources will always successfully prepare.  Mark the transaction as `Prepared`.

4.  **`commit(tx_id: TxId)`**: Commits the transaction.  If the transaction is in the `Prepared` state, apply the changes to the resources.  For this problem, simply change the transaction's state to `Committed`. If the transaction is not in the `Prepared` state, the commit should fail and return an error.

5.  **`rollback(tx_id: TxId)`**: Rolls back the transaction. If the transaction is in the `Pending` or `Prepared` state, revert any changes that were *tentatively* made to the resources. In this simplified version, simply change the transaction's state to `RolledBack`.

6.  **`get_transaction_status(tx_id: TxId)`**: Returns the current status (`Pending`, `Prepared`, `Committed`, `RolledBack`) of the transaction.

**Data Structures:**

You will need to define appropriate structs and enums for:

*   `TxId`: A unique identifier for a transaction (e.g., `u64`).
*   `ResourceId`: A unique identifier for a resource (e.g., `String`).
*   `ServiceId`: A unique identifier for a service (e.g., `String`).
*   Transaction Status: An enum representing the possible states of a transaction (`Pending`, `Prepared`, `Committed`, `RolledBack`).
*   `DistributedTransactionManager`: The main struct that manages the transactions and resources.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Thread Safety:** The `DistributedTransactionManager` must be thread-safe, allowing multiple threads to concurrently interact with it.  Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`) to protect shared data.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling.  Return appropriate `Result` types to indicate success or failure, especially for `commit` and `rollback` operations.
*   **Resource Management:** While you don't need to implement actual resource changes, consider how you would track the resources affected by each transaction.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:** While you don't need to *solve* deadlock, consider the *possibility* of deadlock and how you might detect it in a more complete implementation. Comment in your code about what considerations would need to be made for deadlock prevention.
*   **Optimization:** While functional correctness is the primary goal, strive for reasonable efficiency. Consider the time complexity of the operations and choose appropriate data structures.  For example, what data structures would be ideal for fast lookups?
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as attempting to commit or rollback a non-existent transaction, registering the same resource multiple times, and concurrent access to the same resource by different transactions.
*   **No External Crates (Except for Testing and Synchronization):**  You may use `std::sync` for synchronization primitives like `Mutex` and `RwLock`, and standard testing crates for unit tests.  Avoid relying on external crates for core DTM logic to demonstrate your understanding of fundamental concepts.

**Bonus Challenge:**

*   Implement a "two-phase commit" (2PC) protocol simulation, even if it's still within the single process. Think about how you would handle the "vote request" from the coordinator to each participant.

This problem requires a solid understanding of Rust's concurrency features, error handling, and data structures. Good luck!

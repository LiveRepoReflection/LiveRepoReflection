Okay, I'm ready. Here's a problem designed to be challenging in Rust, incorporating your suggested elements:

**Project Name:** `DistributedLockManager`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed lock manager. In a distributed system, multiple processes might need exclusive access to a shared resource (e.g., a file, a database record). A distributed lock manager ensures that only one process can hold the lock for a given resource at any time.

Your lock manager should support the following operations:

*   **`lock(resource_id: String, client_id: String, timeout: u64) -> Result<bool, LockError>`:** Attempts to acquire a lock on the resource identified by `resource_id` on behalf of the client identified by `client_id`.
    *   The `timeout` parameter specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) the client is willing to wait for the lock.
    *   Returns `Ok(true)` if the lock is successfully acquired within the timeout period. Returns `Ok(false)` if the lock could not be acquired within the timeout.
    *   Returns `Err(LockError)` if any error occurs during the lock acquisition process.
*   **`unlock(resource_id: String, client_id: String) -> Result<bool, LockError>`:** Releases the lock on the resource identified by `resource_id` held by the client identified by `client_id`.
    *   Returns `Ok(true)` if the lock was successfully released. Returns `Ok(false)` if the client did not hold the lock.
    *   Returns `Err(LockError)` if any error occurs during the unlock process.
*   **`heartbeat(resource_id: String, client_id: String) -> Result<bool, LockError>`:**  Extends the lock's lifetime for a resource held by a client.  This prevents locks from expiring prematurely due to temporary network issues or client delays.
    *   Returns `Ok(true)` if the heartbeat was successful (the lock exists and is held by the client). Returns `Ok(false)` if the client does not hold the lock.
    *   Returns `Err(LockError)` if any error occurs during the heartbeat process.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Concurrency:** The lock manager must handle concurrent requests from multiple clients safely and efficiently.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The lock manager should be resilient to failures. Consider what happens if a client holding a lock crashes. Locks should automatically expire after a certain period (e.g., 2 * timeout passed to the lock function) if the client fails to release them.
*   **Reentrancy:** The lock manager **must not** support reentrant locks (i.e., a client cannot acquire the same lock multiple times without releasing it).
*   **Efficiency:** Implement the lock manager with efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize latency and maximize throughput.  Consider the trade-offs between different data structures.
*   **Scalability:** While you don't need to implement actual distributed communication, your design should be amenable to being scaled out to multiple lock manager instances. Think about how you would handle data partitioning and consistency.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:** The lock manager doesn't need to handle deadlock prevention as there is no mechanism to request multiple locks at the same time.
*   **Lock expiration:** Implement an expiration mechanism to automatically release locks held by clients that crash or become unresponsive. The expiration time should be configurable and should be reset each time a client sends a heartbeat for the lock.

**Error Handling:**

Define a custom `LockError` enum with the following variants:

*   `ResourceLocked`: The resource is already locked by another client.
*   `LockNotHeld`: The client does not hold the lock for the specified resource.
*   `InternalError`: An unexpected internal error occurred.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Minimize the time it takes to acquire and release locks.
*   Optimize the heartbeat mechanism to reduce the load on the lock manager.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures for storing lock information to ensure fast lookup and updates.

**Real-world Considerations:**

*   This problem is a simplified version of what distributed systems like ZooKeeper or etcd provide.

**Deliverables:**

*   A well-documented Rust crate containing the implementation of the `DistributedLockManager` with the specified `lock`, `unlock` and `heartbeat` functions.
*   A `LockError` enum for error handling.
*   Clear and concise code with appropriate comments.

This problem requires a good understanding of concurrency, data structures, and system design principles. Good luck!

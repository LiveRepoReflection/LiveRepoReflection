Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to a LeetCode Hard difficulty question, incorporating many of the requested elements.

### Project Name

`DistributedMedian`

### Question Description

You are building a distributed system for real-time data analysis. One critical requirement is to efficiently calculate the running median of a massive stream of numerical data distributed across multiple worker nodes.

**Problem:**

Design and implement a system in Rust that can compute the approximate running median of a stream of `u64` integers arriving from `N` worker nodes.  Each worker node sends a continuous stream of data. Your system consists of a central aggregator node that receives data from all worker nodes and maintains the running median.

**Specific Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Real-Time Approximation:**  Calculating the exact median for every new data point is computationally expensive.  Instead, you need to maintain an *approximate* median with a guaranteed maximum error rate of `E` (e.g., 0.01 for 1% error). This means the returned median can be at most `E * max(data_value)` away from the true median, where `max(data_value)` is the maximum value seen so far in the stream.

2.  **Distributed Input:** The data arrives from `N` worker nodes concurrently.  You need to handle this concurrent input efficiently. Assume `N` can be a large number (e.g., 1000). Data from each worker is unordered and can be interleaved arbitrarily with data from other workers.

3.  **Memory Constraint:**  The system has a limited memory budget. You cannot store all incoming data points.  Your solution should use a data structure that consumes significantly less memory than storing all the numbers.  Aim for logarithmic memory usage relative to the number of distinct values.

4.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a high volume of data updates. Aim for an average-case time complexity of O(log M) for each update to the median tracking data structure, where M is the number of distinct values seen so far.

5.  **Error Handling:**  Implement appropriate error handling for invalid input data or unexpected conditions (e.g., negative numbers when only positive numbers are expected). Return appropriate error results instead of panicking.

6.  **Concurrency Safety:** Ensure your data structures and algorithms are thread-safe to handle concurrent updates from multiple worker threads. Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., Mutexes, RwLock, Channels) to avoid race conditions.

7. **Data Type and Range:** The input data are unsigned 64-bit integers (`u64`).

8. **Handling Duplicates:** The data stream may contain duplicate values. Your solution must handle duplicates correctly.

**Input:**

*   `N`: Number of worker nodes (provided at initialization).
*   Data Stream: A continuous stream of `u64` integers from each of the `N` worker nodes.  You will simulate the incoming data through some form of channel or shared data structure.
*   `E`: Maximum error rate (a `f64` value between 0.0 and 1.0).

**Output:**

*   A function/method that returns the approximate running median after each update.
*   The running median should be a `f64` to allow for fractional values.

**Considerations for Optimization:**

*   Explore different data structures that allow for approximate quantile calculation with logarithmic memory footprint, such as:
    *   t-digest
    *   GK summary
    *   Histograms with dynamic binning
*   Consider using techniques like differential privacy (although not strictly required, thinking about it can help with approximation strategies) to reduce the memory footprint.
*   Carefully choose your synchronization primitives to minimize contention and maximize throughput.

This problem tests your knowledge of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles. Good luck!

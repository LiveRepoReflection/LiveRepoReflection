## Question: Adaptive Network Flow Control

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing an adaptive network flow control system for a data center. The data center handles a large number of flow requests between servers. Each server has a limited bandwidth capacity for sending and receiving data. Due to fluctuating network conditions and varying request sizes, you need to dynamically adjust the flow rates to maximize overall throughput while minimizing congestion and packet loss.

Specifically, you are given a network represented as a directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent servers in the data center.
*   Edges represent network links between servers.
*   Each edge has a maximum capacity (bandwidth) associated with it.

You are also given a series of flow requests. Each flow request consists of:

*   A source server (node).
*   A destination server (node).
*   A requested flow rate (in units of data per second).

Your task is to implement an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the flow rates for each request to optimize network utilization. The algorithm must consider the following constraints:

1.  **Capacity Constraints:** The total flow through any edge must not exceed its capacity.
2.  **Fairness:** The algorithm should attempt to allocate bandwidth fairly among competing requests.  A simple "first come, first served" approach is not acceptable.
3.  **Adaptability:** The algorithm must adapt to changes in network conditions and flow requests. This includes handling new requests, completing requests, and changes in edge capacities or request sizes.
4.  **Responsiveness:** The algorithm should converge to a near-optimal solution relatively quickly.  Slow convergence can lead to prolonged congestion.

**Input:**

The input will be provided in the following format:

1.  **Network Description:** A list of edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(source_node, destination_node, capacity)`. Node IDs are integers. Capacities are integers representing the maximum flow rate.
2.  **Initial Flow Requests:** A list of flow requests, where each request is represented as a tuple `(request_id, source_node, destination_node, requested_flow_rate)`. Request IDs are unique integers. Flow rates are integers.
3.  **Events:** A series of events that modify the network or flow requests. Each event is one of the following types:
    *   `("add_request", request_id, source_node, destination_node, requested_flow_rate)`: A new flow request is added.
    *   `("remove_request", request_id)`: An existing flow request is removed.
    *   `("update_request", request_id, new_requested_flow_rate)`: The requested flow rate for an existing request is updated.
    *   `("update_capacity", source_node, destination_node, new_capacity)`: The capacity of an edge is updated.

**Output:**

For each event in the input, your algorithm must output the *achieved* flow rate for *each* active flow request *after* processing that event. The output should be a list of tuples `(request_id, achieved_flow_rate)`, sorted by `request_id`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of servers (nodes) will be at most 100.
*   The number of edges will be at most 200.
*   The number of flow requests will be at most 500.
*   Capacities and flow rates will be positive integers.
*   The algorithm must complete within a time limit. (This time limit will be stricter than typical LeetCode Hard problems; aim for highly optimized solutions).
*   Memory usage should be reasonable (avoid excessive memory allocation).

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** The flow rates must satisfy the capacity constraints and be correctly updated after each event.
2.  **Throughput:** The algorithm should maximize the overall achieved flow rate across all requests.
3.  **Fairness:** The algorithm should distribute bandwidth relatively fairly among competing requests.  A Gini coefficient or similar fairness metric will be used to assess this.
4.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient in terms of both time and memory usage.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using appropriate data structures for representing the network and flow requests (e.g., adjacency lists, hash maps).
*   Explore different flow control algorithms, such as max-flow min-cut, proportional fairness, or congestion control algorithms inspired by TCP.
*   Pay close attention to edge cases and potential bottlenecks in your implementation.
*   Optimize your code for performance, as the time limit will be tight.

This problem requires a deep understanding of network flow algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

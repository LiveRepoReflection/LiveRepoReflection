Okay, I understand. Here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard in difficulty, emphasizing advanced concepts and optimization.

**Problem:  Optimal Multi-Source Shortest Path Tree Construction**

**Description:**

You are given a weighted, undirected graph representing a network of interconnected locations. The graph is defined by a list of vertices (locations) and a list of edges (connections between locations), where each edge has a non-negative weight representing the cost of traversing that connection.

You are also given a set of *k* source vertices. Your task is to construct an *optimal* multi-source shortest path tree (MSSPT). An MSSPT is a tree rooted at the *k* source vertices, such that for *every* vertex *v* in the graph, the shortest path from *any* of the *k* source vertices to *v* in the *original graph* is also a path in the MSSPT.  "Optimal" in this context means minimizing the *total weight* of the edges included in the constructed MSSPT.

**Input:**

*   `n`: An integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (vertices are numbered from 0 to n-1).
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, w)` represents an undirected edge between vertex `u` and vertex `v` with weight `w`.
*   `sources`: A vector of integers representing the source vertices.  1 <= *k* <= *n*.

**Output:**

The function should return the *total weight* of the edges in the optimal MSSPT.  If it's impossible to construct a valid MSSPT (e.g., the graph is disconnected and no source can reach some vertices), return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `n` <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   0 <= `edges.len()` <= 3 * 10<sup>5</sup>
*   0 <= `u`, `v` < `n`
*   0 <= `w` <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   The graph may contain duplicate edges between two vertices, and self-loops (edges from a vertex to itself). Handle these appropriately.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Consider potential integer overflow when calculating the total weight.

**Requirements:**

*   **Efficiency:** Your solution must be efficient, both in terms of time and memory.  A naive approach will likely result in Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) errors. Consider the algorithmic complexity of your solution.
*   **Correctness:** Your solution must correctly handle all valid input graphs and source vertex sets, including edge cases like disconnected graphs, duplicate edges, and self-loops.
*   **Optimality:**  The returned total weight must be the *minimum possible* weight of a valid MSSPT.
*   **Data Structures:**  Carefully choose appropriate data structures for graph representation and shortest path calculations. The choice of data structure is critical to achieving optimal performance.
*   **Error Handling:** The function must correctly handle the case where a valid MSSPT cannot be constructed (return -1).

**Hints (subtle, to guide without giving away the solution):**

*   Think about how standard shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's) can be adapted for multiple sources.
*   Consider using a priority queue to efficiently explore the graph.
*   Think about how to determine which edges should be included in the MSSPT to minimize the total weight.
*   Consider using disjoint set union (DSU) data structure.
*   Think if you need to implement the Fibonacci Heap or not.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

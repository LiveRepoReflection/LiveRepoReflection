Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, drawing inspiration from the elements you specified.

## Problem: Optimal Traffic Light Synchronization

**Description:**

Imagine you are tasked with optimizing the traffic flow in a city represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents an intersection, and each directed edge represents a one-way street connecting two intersections. Each intersection has a traffic light that cycles through red, yellow, and green states. The duration of each state (red, yellow, green) can be configured independently for each traffic light.

Your goal is to find the optimal synchronization scheme for the traffic lights to minimize the average travel time between *k* given source-destination pairs.

**Specifically:**

*   **Graph Representation:** The city is represented as a directed graph where nodes are intersections (numbered from 0 to `n-1`) and edges are one-way streets. The graph is provided as an adjacency list. Each edge has a travel time associated with it (in seconds).

*   **Traffic Lights:** Each intersection (node) has a traffic light with configurable red, yellow, and green durations. All traffic lights cycle continuously through these three states in that order (red -> yellow -> green -> red...).

*   **State Durations:** You are given a range of allowed durations for each state (red, yellow, green) for each traffic light. For example, the red duration for intersection `i` must be within the range `[min_red_i, max_red_i]`. The same applies to yellow and green durations. These ranges are inclusive. All durations are in seconds and are integers.

*   **Travel Time:** The travel time between a source and destination is calculated as the shortest path through the graph, considering the waiting time at each traffic light. When a traveler arrives at an intersection, they must wait until the light turns green before proceeding. If they arrive while the light is green, there is no waiting time.

*   **Source-Destination Pairs:** You are given *k* source-destination pairs. For each pair, you need to find the shortest path from the source to the destination, considering the traffic light timings.

*   **Optimization Objective:** Your task is to find the traffic light durations (red, yellow, green for each intersection) that minimize the *average* travel time across all *k* source-destination pairs.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as follows:

1.  `n`: The number of intersections (nodes) in the graph.
2.  `m`: The number of one-way streets (edges) in the graph.
3.  `edges`: A vector of tuples representing the edges: `(source: usize, destination: usize, travel_time: u32)`.
4.  `duration_ranges`: A vector of tuples, one for each intersection, representing the allowed duration ranges: `(min_red: u32, max_red: u32, min_yellow: u32, max_yellow: u32, min_green: u32, max_green: u32)`.
5.  `k`: The number of source-destination pairs.
6.  `source_destination_pairs`: A vector of tuples representing the source-destination pairs: `(source: usize, destination: usize)`.
7.  `time_limit`: Total time allowed for the entire execution of the algorithm.

**Output:**

Return a `Vec<u32>` where each element represents the duration of a specific traffic light state in the following order:

```
[red_0, yellow_0, green_0, red_1, yellow_1, green_1, ..., red_{n-1}, yellow_{n-1}, green_{n-1}]
```

These values must be within the specified ranges.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 50`
*   `1 <= m <= 200`
*   `1 <= k <= 10`
*   `1 <= travel_time <= 100`
*   `1 <= min_duration <= max_duration <= 50` for red, yellow, and green states.
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   There exists at least one path between each source-destination pair.
*   Your solution *must* complete within the given `time_limit` (in seconds).  Failing to do so will result in a failure.

**Scoring:**

Your solution will be judged based on the average travel time achieved across a set of hidden test cases. Lower average travel time scores higher.  The scoring will use a relative comparison against the best submission.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search to find the shortest path between source-destination pairs.
*   Think about how to efficiently calculate the waiting time at each traffic light.
*   Explore optimization techniques like Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, or gradient-free optimization methods to find the best traffic light durations.
*   Pay close attention to algorithmic efficiency.  Brute-force approaches will not work within the time limit.
*   Consider using memoization or caching to speed up path calculations.

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful attention to detail. Good luck!

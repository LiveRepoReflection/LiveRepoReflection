Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult and require sophisticated solutions.

**Project Name:** `Optimized Network Partitioning for Resilient Distributed Systems`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing an algorithm for network partitioning in a distributed system to maximize resilience against node failures and minimize communication latency. The system consists of a set of `N` nodes, each with a unique ID from `0` to `N-1`.

The network topology is represented as an undirected graph where nodes are vertices and edges represent communication links between nodes.  Each link has a non-negative cost representing the communication latency between the connected nodes.

The goal is to partition the network into `K` disjoint partitions such that:

1.  **Balanced Partition Sizes:** The size of each partition should be as balanced as possible.  Specifically, the size of any partition `i` should fall within the range `floor(N/K) <= size(i) <= ceil(N/K)`.

2.  **Minimized Inter-Partition Communication:**  Minimize the total cost of communication links that cross partition boundaries (i.e., links where one endpoint is in partition `A` and the other is in partition `B`, where `A != B`). This represents minimizing communication overhead between partitions.

3.  **Fault Tolerance:** Maximize the minimum number of nodes that must fail to disconnect any partition from all other partitions. This represents the "strength" of the partition.  The higher this number, the more resilient the system is.  Think of this as the node connectivity of the partition graph.

**Input:**

*   `N`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= N <= 200).
*   `K`: The desired number of partitions (1 <= K <= N).
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, cost)` represents an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v` with communication latency `cost` (0 <= u < N, 0 <= v < N, 0 <= cost <= 1000). Edges are bidirectional.

**Output:**

Return a vector of vectors representing the partitions.  Each inner vector represents a partition and contains the node IDs belonging to that partition.  The partitions must satisfy the constraints described above.

**Constraints:**

*   The solution must complete within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).
*   The solution should attempt to find the *optimal* or at least a very *good* partitioning based on a combined score derived from the three objectives (balanced sizes, minimized inter-partition communication, maximized fault tolerance). You will have to devise your own scoring function to balance these competing objectives.
*   The input graph may not be fully connected.
*   There may be multiple valid partitionings; the goal is to find a partitioning that optimizes the combined score.

**Evaluation:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on a scoring function that considers:

*   **Partition Size Balance:** How closely the partition sizes adhere to the ideal balance.
*   **Inter-Partition Communication Cost:** The total cost of edges crossing partition boundaries.
*   **Minimum Partition Fault Tolerance:**  The minimum node connectivity among all partitions.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using graph algorithms such as min-cut, max-flow, or community detection algorithms as building blocks.
*   Explore heuristic search techniques like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms to explore the solution space efficiently.
*   Careful consideration of data structures is crucial for performance.
*   Think about how to efficiently calculate the connectivity of a graph or partition.
*   The scoring function that you devise is critical to the success of your solution. Experiment with different weighting strategies for the three objectives.

This problem requires a combination of graph theory knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and optimization skills.  Good luck!

## Question: Decentralized Autonomous Graph Oracle (DAGO)

**Description:**

Imagine a decentralized social network where users own their data and relationships. You're tasked with building a highly scalable and reliable graph oracle for this network. This oracle needs to efficiently answer complex graph queries, but with a twist: the graph data is fragmented and distributed across numerous peer-to-peer nodes, and the nodes themselves are not always reliable.

Each node in the network stores a fragment of the overall social graph, representing the relationships of users it directly serves.  These relationships are represented as directed edges: `(user_id, friend_id)`. Nodes are identified by a unique `node_id`.

Your task is to implement a distributed algorithm that can answer the following type of query: "Find all paths of length *k* between user A and user B, considering all available nodes in the network."

**Input:**

*   `nodes`: A `HashMap<node_id, Vec<(user_id, friend_id)>>` representing the graph fragments stored on each node.  Each `node_id` is a `u64`, and each `user_id` and `friend_id` are also `u64`. The `Vec<(user_id, friend_id)>` represents the edges known to that node.
*   `start_user`: The `user_id` of the starting user (type `u64`).
*   `end_user`: The `user_id` of the ending user (type `u64`).
*   `path_length`:  The exact length *k* of the paths to find (type `u32`).

**Output:**

*   `Vec<Vec<u64>>`: A vector of vectors, where each inner vector represents a valid path of length *k* from `start_user` to `end_user`. Each path should be a sequence of `user_id`s. Paths can contain loops, but only if they contribute to a valid path of length *k*.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Scalability:** The solution should be able to handle a large number of nodes and edges. Avoid algorithms with exponential complexity if possible.
2.  **Fault Tolerance:** Nodes can be unreliable. Some nodes might be temporarily unavailable or return incomplete/incorrect data. Your solution must be robust against such failures.  You are **not** guaranteed that all nodes are reachable or that the provided data is fully consistent. The correctness of an individual node's data cannot be verified by your solution; your solution will need to work with the given data.
3.  **Distributed Computation:** You should aim to minimize the amount of data transferred between nodes to reduce network overhead. Prefiltering and local computations are encouraged. (Note: For this single-node simulation, the "network overhead" is a theoretical consideration for scoring purposes.)
4.  **Time Limit:**  Your solution will be time-limited.  Inefficient algorithms will likely fail.
5.  **Memory Limit:** Your solution will be memory-limited. Avoid unnecessary data duplication.
6.  **No External Dependencies:** You can only use the Rust standard library.
7.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where no paths exist between the users, or where `path_length` is 0 or very large.
8.  **Cycles:** The graph can contain cycles. Your algorithm should handle cycles correctly without infinite loops.
9.  **Disconnected Graph:** The graph might be disconnected (i.e., no path between the start and end users).

**Optimization Considerations (Scoring):**

*   **Runtime Performance:** Solutions with better runtime performance will score higher.
*   **Memory Usage:** Solutions with lower memory usage will score higher.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Solutions that gracefully handle node failures and inconsistencies will score higher. (Simulated by omitting or corrupting data for some nodes in test cases.)
*   **Data Locality:** Solutions that minimize data transfer (even within the single-node simulation) will score higher, as this reflects good design for a truly distributed system.

**Example:**

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn find_paths(nodes: &HashMap<u64, Vec<(u64, u64)>>, start_user: u64, end_user: u64, path_length: u32) -> Vec<Vec<u64>> {
    // Your implementation here
    Vec::new()
}
```

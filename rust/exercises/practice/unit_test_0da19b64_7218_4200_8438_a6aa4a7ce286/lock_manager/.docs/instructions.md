Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated, aiming for a LeetCode Hard level.

### Project Name

```
distributed_lock_manager
```

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed lock manager (DLM) in Rust. This DLM will be used by multiple services running across a cluster to coordinate access to shared resources, preventing race conditions and ensuring data consistency.

**Functionality:**

The DLM should provide the following core functionalities:

*   **Lock Acquisition:** A client can request a lock on a specific resource (identified by a string key). The request should be blocking, meaning the client waits until the lock is acquired or a timeout occurs.
*   **Lock Release:** A client can release a lock it holds on a resource.
*   **Lock Timeout:** If a client holds a lock for longer than a configured timeout, the lock should be automatically released. This prevents deadlocks caused by client failures.
*   **Fairness (Optional, but highly encouraged for extra points):**  The DLM should attempt to grant locks in a fair manner, preventing starvation of any particular client.
*   **Reentrancy (Optional, but highly encouraged for extra points):** A client should be able to acquire the same lock multiple times without blocking itself. Each acquisition requires a corresponding release.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Concurrency:** The DLM must be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.
*   **Distribution:** The DLM should be designed to be distributed across multiple nodes.  For the purpose of this problem, you only need to implement the core locking logic within a single node. Focus on handling concurrent requests correctly. Assume a separate mechanism (e.g., Raft, Paxos) handles distributed consensus and node coordination, and you do not need to implement that mechanism. Consider how your locking logic would integrate with a distributed consensus mechanism. Think about leader election, data replication, and handling node failures.
*   **Efficiency:**  The DLM should be efficient in terms of both CPU usage and memory consumption. Avoid unnecessary allocations and computations. Prioritize speed for common operations like lock acquisition and release.
*   **Correctness:**  The DLM must guarantee mutual exclusion. Only one client can hold a lock on a resource at any given time (unless reentrancy is implemented and the same client holds the lock multiple times).
*   **Error Handling:** The DLM should handle errors gracefully, such as invalid lock requests, timeouts, and client disconnections.
*   **Timeout Management:** The timeout mechanism must be accurate and reliable, even under heavy load.
*   **Deadlock Prevention:** While a timeout helps, you should consider other potential deadlock scenarios and how to mitigate them beyond just lock timeouts.
*   **Lock Granularity:** The locking granularity is per resource key (String).
*   **Scalability:** The DLM design should be scalable to handle a large number of resources and clients.
*   **Testing:** Your solution must be thoroughly tested to ensure its correctness and performance.

**Input:**

The DLM receives requests to acquire and release locks, identified by a resource key. The requests include a client identifier, resource key, and optional timeout value.

**Output:**

The DLM returns success or failure responses to lock acquisition and release requests.

**Considerations for a Good Solution:**

*   **Data Structures:**  Carefully choose appropriate data structures to represent locks, queues of waiting clients, and timeout information. Consider the trade-offs between different data structures in terms of performance and memory usage.
*   **Concurrency Primitives:**  Use Rust's concurrency primitives (e.g., Mutex, RwLock, Condvar, async/await) effectively to protect shared data and coordinate access to resources.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:**  Consider using asynchronous operations to handle lock requests and timeouts without blocking the main thread.
*   **Testing Strategy:**  Develop a comprehensive testing strategy that covers various scenarios, including concurrent requests, timeouts, error conditions, and edge cases.
*   **Documentation:**  Provide clear and concise documentation for your code, explaining the design choices, implementation details, and usage instructions.

This problem requires a deep understanding of concurrency, data structures, and algorithms, as well as experience with Rust's concurrency features. Good luck!

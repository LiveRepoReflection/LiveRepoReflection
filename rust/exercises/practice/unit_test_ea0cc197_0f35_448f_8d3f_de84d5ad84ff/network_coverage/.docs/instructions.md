`OptimalNetworkDeployment`

## Question Description

A large telecommunications company, "TelCo," plans to deploy a 5G network across a major metropolitan area. The city can be represented as a weighted undirected graph, where nodes represent potential base station locations and edges represent the cost of laying fiber optic cable between locations. TelCo has a limited budget (`B`) for deploying base stations and laying cable.

TelCo wants to maximize the population coverage within the budget. Each potential base station location has an associated population coverage value (`P_i`).  However, due to signal interference, the effective coverage of a base station decreases as more base stations are deployed within a certain radius. Specifically, if `k` base stations (including itself) are deployed within a distance `R` of a base station, its effective population coverage is reduced to `P_i / k`. The distance between any two base stations is calculated using the shortest path on the graph (sum of edge weights along the path).

**Your Task:**

Write a function that takes the following inputs and returns the maximum achievable population coverage within the given budget:

*   `graph`: A representation of the city's network as a list of edges. Each edge is a tuple `(u, v, weight)`, where `u` and `v` are node IDs (integers starting from 0), and `weight` is the cost of laying cable between them.
*   `population`: A list of integers, where `population[i]` represents the population coverage value (`P_i`) of node `i`.
*   `B`: The total budget available for deployment (integer).
*   `R`: The interference radius (integer).

Your function should return a single floating-point number representing the maximum total effective population coverage achievable.

**Constraints:**

*   The graph can have up to 200 nodes.
*   The budget `B` can be up to 100,000.
*   The population coverage values (`P_i`) can be up to 10,000.
*   Edge weights (cable costs) are positive integers up to 1,000.
*   The interference radius `R` is a positive integer up to 50.
*   Nodes are numbered from 0 to `N-1`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the graph.
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   The return value should have an absolute or relative error of at most `1e-6`.

**Efficiency Requirements:**

Your solution must be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds). Consider the time complexity of your chosen algorithms and data structures.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Empty graph.
*   Budget of 0.
*   All population values are 0.
*   Large interference radius.

**Optimization Considerations:**

*   Deploying a base station incurs two costs: the cost of the base station itself (which we can assume is negligible compared to the cable cost) and the cost of connecting it to the existing network. You need to find the optimal set of base stations and the minimum cost to connect them.
*   Consider using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to efficiently explore the search space of possible base station deployments.
*   Think about how to efficiently calculate the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
*   Think about how to efficiently determine which base stations are within the interference radius `R` of each other.

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Rust problem:

**Problem Name:** Distributed Key-Value Store with Fault Tolerance

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a simplified distributed key-value store.  The store consists of `N` nodes, where `N` is configurable.  Each key is assigned a primary node based on a consistent hashing scheme (you can choose any consistent hashing algorithm you prefer, but it must be deterministic).  However, to ensure fault tolerance, each key is also replicated to `R` additional nodes, forming a replication group of size `R+1`. These `R` additional nodes should be the immediate successors of the primary node in the consistent hash ring.

Your system must support the following operations:

*   **`put(key: String, value: String)`:**  Stores the key-value pair. The `put` operation must be performed on the primary node. The primary node is then responsible for replicating the key-value pair to the other `R` nodes in the replication group.

*   **`get(key: String)`:** Retrieves the value associated with the key. The `get` operation can be performed on *any* node in the replication group. If the node has the key-value pair, it should return the value. If the node *doesn't* have the key-value pair, it should forward the `get` request to another node in the replication group (hint: think about the consistent hashing ring). If *none* of the nodes in the replication group have the value, it should return `None`.

*   **`delete(key: String)`:** Deletes the key-value pair. The `delete` operation must be performed on the primary node. The primary node is then responsible for replicating the deletion to the other `R` nodes in the replication group.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should continue to function correctly even if up to `F` nodes fail, where `F < R`.  Consider scenarios where nodes in the replication group fail during `put`, `get`, and `delete` operations. Your implementation must handle these failures gracefully. Assume failed nodes simply become unavailable.

*   **Consistency:**  You don't need to implement strict consistency (e.g., linearizability). Eventual consistency is acceptable. However, you *must* describe the consistency model your implementation provides and justify why it's suitable given the fault tolerance requirements.  Think about scenarios like network partitions or delayed replication.

*   **Concurrency:**  The system must handle concurrent `put`, `get`, and `delete` operations. Ensure data integrity and avoid race conditions using appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, read-write locks).

*   **Scalability:**  While you don't need to implement dynamic scaling in this exercise, consider how your design would scale to a large number of nodes and keys.  The consistent hashing scheme should help with this.

*   **Efficiency:**  Optimize for read performance. `get` operations should be as fast as possible.  Consider trade-offs between read and write performance.

*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.  Return appropriate error codes or messages for invalid operations (e.g., trying to `get` or `delete` a non-existent key).

*   **Communication:** You can simulate network communication between nodes using in-memory channels (e.g., `tokio::sync::mpsc`).  You don't need to implement actual network sockets.

*   **Node Discovery:** Assume that each node knows the addresses (in this case, the channel endpoints) of all other nodes in the cluster.

*   **Data Storage:**  You can use a simple in-memory data structure (e.g., `HashMap`) to store the key-value pairs within each node.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and removing failed nodes from the consistent hash ring.
*   Implement a conflict resolution strategy for cases where concurrent `put` operations modify the same key on different nodes in the replication group.  For example, you could use timestamps or vector clocks.
*   Implement a simple load balancing mechanism to distribute keys more evenly across the nodes.

This problem requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and fault tolerance. Good luck!

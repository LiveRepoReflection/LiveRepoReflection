## Problem: Network Partitioning for Microservice Deployment

**Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of a suite of microservices across a distributed network of servers. The network is represented as a weighted, undirected graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent individual servers. Each server has a limited resource capacity (CPU, Memory, Disk) represented as a tuple `(cpu: u64, memory: u64, disk: u64)`.
*   **Edges:** Represent the network connection between servers.  The weight of each edge represents the latency of communication between the connected servers.

You are given a set of microservices to deploy. Each microservice has a resource requirement tuple `(cpu: u64, memory: u64, disk: u64)` and a set of dependencies on other microservices. These dependencies form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where an edge from microservice A to microservice B means that microservice A depends on microservice B.

Your goal is to partition the servers into a specified number `k` of clusters such that:

1.  **Capacity Constraint:**  For each cluster, the sum of the resource requirements of all microservices deployed in that cluster *must not exceed* the *minimum* resource capacity of any server within that cluster.  That is, a cluster can only host services if every server in that cluster can individually handle the combined resources.
2.  **Dependency Constraint:** If microservice A depends on microservice B, then microservice B must be deployed in either the same cluster as microservice A, or in a cluster that has *lower average latency* to the cluster containing microservice A. The average latency between two clusters is the average edge weight between all pairs of servers where one server is in the first cluster and the other is in the second cluster.
3.  **Connectivity Constraint:** Each cluster must be a connected subgraph.
4.  **Minimization Goal:** Minimize the maximum average latency *between* any two clusters containing dependent microservices. (The latency between clusters with no dependency is ignored).

**Input:**

*   `servers: Vec<(u64, u64, u64)>` - A vector of tuples representing the resource capacity of each server in the network. The index represents the server ID.
*   `edges: Vec<(usize, usize, u64)>` - A vector of tuples representing the edges in the network. Each tuple contains the server IDs connected by the edge and the latency between them.  Assume edges are undirected; if (a, b, w) exists, (b, a, w) also implicitly exists.
*   `microservices: Vec<(u64, u64, u64)>` - A vector of tuples representing the resource requirements of each microservice. The index represents the microservice ID.
*   `dependencies: Vec<(usize, usize)>` - A vector of tuples representing dependencies between microservices.  Each tuple (A, B) indicates that microservice A depends on microservice B.
*   `k: usize` - The desired number of clusters.

**Output:**

*   `Option<Vec<Vec<usize>>>` -  An `Option` containing a `Vec` of `Vec<usize>`. The outer `Vec` represents the clusters, and the inner `Vec<usize>` represents the microservice IDs assigned to that cluster.  Return `None` if no valid partitioning exists.  If multiple valid partitions exist, return *any* valid partition.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= number of servers`
*   The number of servers will be between 1 and 100.
*   The number of microservices will be between 1 and 500.
*   Resource capacities and requirements will be non-negative 64-bit integers.
*   Latency values will be non-negative 64-bit integers.
*   The dependency graph will be a DAG.

**Example:**
Let's say you have a small network with 3 servers, 3 microservices, and want 2 clusters:

```
servers = [(10, 10, 10), (12, 12, 12), (15, 15, 15)]  // CPU, Memory, Disk
edges = [(0, 1, 5), (1, 2, 3)]  // server1 <-> server2, server2 <-> server3
microservices = [(3, 3, 3), (2, 2, 2), (4, 4, 4)]
dependencies = [(0, 1), (2, 0)]
k = 2
```

A possible valid output could be:

```
Some(vec![vec![1, 2], vec![0]])
```

In this scenario, microservice 1 and 2 are in the same cluster, and microservice 0 is in a different cluster.
The capacity constraint must be satisfied for each cluster.
Because microservice 0 depends on microservice 1, it must be in a cluster with lower average latency.

**Judging Criteria:**

Solutions will be judged on correctness (meeting all constraints) and efficiency (runtime performance). Solutions with better time complexity will be favored. Brute force solutions will likely not pass all test cases.

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, optimization techniques (possibly involving heuristics or approximation algorithms), and careful handling of constraints. It's likely to require a good understanding of data structures and algorithms to solve efficiently. Good luck!

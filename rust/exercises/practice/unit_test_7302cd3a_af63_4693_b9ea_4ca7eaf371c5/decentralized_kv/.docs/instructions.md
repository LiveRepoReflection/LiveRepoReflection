Okay, here's a challenging Rust programming competition problem, designed to be at a "LeetCode Hard" level.

### Project Name

`DecentralizedKV`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified, in-memory, decentralized key-value store. This key-value store simulates a peer-to-peer network where data is sharded across multiple nodes. Your solution should focus on data consistency, efficient querying, and handling node failures.

**Core Functionality:**

Each node in the network maintains a partial view of the data and communicates with other nodes to satisfy client requests.

1.  **`Node` Struct:** Represent a single node in the network. Each node should have:
    *   A unique ID.
    *   A local key-value store (e.g., a `HashMap`).
    *   A list of other known `Node` IDs (its neighbors). You do NOT need to implement full network discovery, but the Nodes do need some means to know who to talk to.
    *   A mechanism to communicate with other nodes (simulated network calls, no actual networking required).
2.  **`put(key: String, value: String)`:**  Stores a key-value pair in the network.  The key-value pair should be stored on *one* of the nodes based on a simple consistent hashing strategy (see details below). The `put` operation should propagate to replicas (see below).

3.  **`get(key: String)`:** Retrieves the value associated with a given key. The `get` operation should:
    *   Locate the primary node responsible for the key (using consistent hashing).
    *   If the primary node is available, return the value directly.
    *   If the primary node is unavailable, attempt to retrieve the value from a replica.
    *   If the value cannot be found on the primary or any replicas, return `None`.

4.  **Replication:** Implement a simple replication strategy.  Each key-value pair should be replicated to `R` other nodes (where `R` is a configurable parameter).  The replicas should be chosen based on the consistent hashing ring, following the primary node.

5.  **Node Failure:**  The system must handle node failures gracefully.  If a node is unavailable, the `get` operation should attempt to retrieve the value from a replica. Nodes might crash and be unavailable to service requests. A node is considered "down" if a network call to it times out.

6. **Consistent Hashing:** Use a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute keys across the nodes. A simple modulo-based approach on the hash value of the key is sufficient. The ring size is the total number of nodes in the network.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Data Consistency:**  Ensure that the data remains consistent across the network, even in the presence of node failures. Implement a mechanism to handle potential inconsistencies (e.g., using timestamps or version vectors, but a simpler approach is also acceptable given the complexity).
*   **Optimization:** The `get` operation should be optimized for read performance. Minimize the number of network calls required to retrieve a value.
*   **Scalability:**  The system should be designed to handle a large number of nodes and key-value pairs. Consider the impact of replication on storage space and network traffic.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle node failures, network errors, and data inconsistencies.
*   **Concurrency:** Assume concurrent access from multiple clients.  Ensure your data structures are thread-safe and use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
*   **Replication Factor (R):** The replication factor `R` is a configurable parameter passed to the `DecentralizedKV` constructor.  It determines the number of replicas for each key-value pair.
*   **Node Count (N):** The number of nodes `N` is also a configurable parameter passed to the `DecentralizedKV` constructor.
*   **Timeout:** Network calls to other nodes (simulated) should have a timeout (e.g., 100ms). If a node does not respond within the timeout, it should be considered unavailable.
*   **In-Memory:** All data must be stored in memory. Do not use any external databases or persistent storage.
*   **Deterministic Hashing:** Use a deterministic hashing algorithm (like `std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher`) for consistent hashing.

**Input:**

*   The number of nodes in the network (`N`).
*   The replication factor (`R`).
*   A sequence of `put` and `get` operations.

**Output:**

*   The result of each `get` operation (either `Some(value)` or `None`).

**Example:**

```
// Example usage (not a complete test case)
let kv = DecentralizedKV::new(5, 2); // 5 nodes, replication factor 2

kv.put("key1".to_string(), "value1".to_string());
let value = kv.get("key1".to_string()); // Might return Some("value1")

// Simulate a node failure
kv.set_node_down(node_id); // where node_id is the ID of a node to make unavailable

let value_after_failure = kv.get("key1".to_string()); // Should still return Some("value1") because of replication
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution correctly implement the required functionality?
*   Efficiency: Is the solution optimized for read performance?
*   Scalability: Can the solution handle a large number of nodes and key-value pairs?
*   Robustness: Does the solution handle node failures and data inconsistencies gracefully?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

This problem requires a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles.  Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test a range of skills.

## The Colocation Optimization Problem

**Problem Description:**

A large data center hosts numerous virtual machines (VMs) belonging to different customers. Each customer has a specific resource footprint (CPU, Memory, Network Bandwidth) for their VMs. Due to security concerns and contractual obligations, certain customers have restrictions on which other customers' VMs can be collocated (placed on the same physical server).  Colocation can save resources and reduce costs but also introduce security and management overhead.

You are tasked with developing an *optimal* VM placement strategy that maximizes server utilization (minimizes the number of active servers) while adhering to strict colocation constraints and resource limitations.

**Input:**

The input will be structured as follows:

1.  **`server_capacity`**: A tuple `(cpu_capacity: u32, memory_capacity: u64, network_capacity: u32)`. This represents the total CPU cores, memory (in bytes), and network bandwidth (in Mbps) available on each server.  Assume all servers are identical.

2.  **`vm_requests`**: A `Vec<(customer_id: u32, vm_id: u32, cpu_req: u32, mem_req: u64, net_req: u32)>`.  Each tuple represents a request to place a VM.  `customer_id` uniquely identifies the customer owning the VM, `vm_id` uniquely identifies the VM, and `cpu_req`, `mem_req`, `net_req` specify the VM's resource requirements.

3.  **`colocation_restrictions`**: A `Vec<(customer_id_1: u32, customer_id_2: u32)>`. Each tuple indicates that VMs from `customer_id_1` and `customer_id_2` *cannot* be collocated on the same server. This relationship is bidirectional; if (A, B) exists, then (B, A) is implicitly true as well.

4.  **`existing_placements`**: A `HashMap<u32, Vec<(u32, u32)>>`. This represents the current placement of VMs on servers. The key is the server ID (starting from 1). The value is a vector of tuples `(customer_id, vm_id)` representing the VMs currently placed on that server.  Your solution *must* respect these existing placements. You cannot move VMs that are already assigned to a server.

**Output:**

A `HashMap<u32, Vec<(u32, u32)>>` representing the *optimal* VM placement. The key is the server ID (starting from 1). The value is a vector of tuples `(customer_id, vm_id)` representing the VMs placed on that server. VMs in `existing_placements` should remain on their current servers.  If a VM cannot be placed given the constraints and existing placements, the function should return `None`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of VMs can be large (up to 10,000).
*   The number of customers can be significant (up to 1,000).
*   The number of colocation restrictions can also be large (up to 50,000).
*   Server IDs *must* be contiguous, starting from 1. You should not have gaps in the server ID sequence.
*   You must minimize the number of active servers.
*   Resource requirements of VMs on a single server *cannot* exceed the `server_capacity`.
*   Colocation restrictions *must* be strictly enforced.
*   Existing placements must be respected.
*   The solution must be efficient.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   If multiple optimal solutions exist (same number of servers used), any one of them is acceptable.

**Optimization Goal:**

Minimize the number of active servers used. This translates to maximizing server utilization.

**Error Handling:**

*   If it is impossible to place all VMs given the constraints and existing placements, return `None`.

**Example:**

(A simplified example.  Real test cases will be much more complex.)

```
server_capacity = (8, 16GB, 1000)
vm_requests = [
    (1, 101, 2, 4GB, 200),
    (1, 102, 2, 4GB, 200),
    (2, 201, 4, 8GB, 400),
    (3, 301, 2, 4GB, 200),
]
colocation_restrictions = [(1, 2)] # Customer 1 and 2 cannot be collocated.
existing_placements = {}

# Possible optimal output:
# {
#   1: [(1, 101), (1, 102), (3, 301)],
#   2: [(2, 201)]
# }
```

This problem requires a combination of efficient data structures, constraint satisfaction, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem description, designed to be a "Hard" level question, focusing on algorithmic efficiency, system design considerations, and real-world application.

## Problem: Distributed Log Aggregation and Analysis

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed system for collecting, aggregating, and analyzing log data from a large number of geographically distributed servers.  The system should be able to handle high volumes of log data, provide real-time insights, and support complex analytical queries.

Specifically, you need to implement a simplified version of this system.  The core components are:

1.  **Log Producers:** Simulate servers generating log entries. Each log entry consists of:
    *   `timestamp`: A Unix timestamp (u64).
    *   `server_id`: A unique identifier for the server (String).
    *   `log_level`: An enumeration representing the severity of the log (e.g., `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`).
    *   `message`: A string containing the log message.

2.  **Log Collectors:**  These components receive log entries from the Log Producers.  They are responsible for buffering and batching log entries before forwarding them to the Aggregators.

3.  **Log Aggregators:** These components receive batches of log entries from the Log Collectors. They must:
    *   Aggregate logs across all servers.
    *   Maintain a real-time count of log entries for each `log_level` within a sliding time window of `W` seconds.
    *   Support queries for the aggregated counts for a given `log_level` within the time window `W`.

4.  **Query Interface:** Allows users to query the system for the aggregate counts of log levels within the sliding time window.

Your task is to implement the `LogAggregator` component, focusing on efficiency and scalability.  You'll be provided with simulated Log Producers and Collectors that feed data to your aggregator.  The query interface will also be provided.

**Requirements:**

*   **Real-time Analysis:** The system should maintain the log level counts in near real-time.  Query results should reflect the state of the logs within the sliding window `W`.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** The `LogAggregator` should be designed to minimize memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of servers and high log volume. Avoid storing entire log messages.
*   **Concurrency:** The `LogAggregator` must be thread-safe and able to handle concurrent updates from multiple Log Collectors and concurrent queries from multiple users. Use appropriate synchronization primitives to avoid race conditions.
*   **Time Windowing:** Implement a sliding time window of `W` seconds.  Log entries older than `W` seconds should be automatically expired and removed from the aggregated counts.
*   **Query Performance:** Queries for aggregated log level counts should be efficient.  Avoid full scans of the log data for each query. The target is O(1) or O(log N) complexity for query processing, where N is the number of log levels.
*   **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., invalid log entries, network issues).

**Constraints:**

*   The sliding time window `W` can be large (e.g., 60 seconds, 300 seconds, or even larger).
*   The number of servers can be very large (e.g., 10,000+).
*   The log volume can be extremely high (e.g., 1 million+ log entries per second).
*   You are limited in the amount of memory you can use for the aggregator.
*   Log entries may arrive out of order (but within a reasonable time skew).
*   The system should be resilient to temporary network disruptions between Log Collectors and the Aggregator.

**Specific Implementation Details:**

*   You are free to choose the data structures and algorithms you deem most appropriate. Consider using concurrent data structures, efficient data expiration strategies, and caching techniques.
*   Focus on the `LogAggregator` component. Assume the Log Producers and Collectors are already implemented and provide data to your aggregator.  The query interface is also assumed to be implemented.
*   The `LogAggregator` should expose a method to receive batches of log entries and a method to query the aggregated counts for a specific log level.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness:**  Accurately calculating and maintaining the aggregated log level counts within the sliding time window.
*   **Performance:**  The speed of processing log entries and responding to queries.
*   **Memory Usage:**  The amount of memory consumed by the `LogAggregator`.
*   **Concurrency Handling:**  Correctly handling concurrent updates and queries without race conditions.
*   **Code Quality:**  Clarity, readability, and maintainability of the code.
*   **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of potential errors.

This problem requires a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, concurrency, and system design principles.  It challenges the solver to think about real-world constraints and trade-offs when designing a high-performance, scalable, and reliable system.  Good luck!

Okay, here's a challenging Rust problem designed to test a range of skills.

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed transaction coordinator (DTC) for managing atomic transactions across multiple participating nodes. This coordinator will use a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol.

**System Design Requirements:**

1.  **Nodes:** Represented by unique string identifiers (e.g., `"node1"`, `"node2"`).
2.  **Transactions:** Represented by unique transaction IDs (UUIDs).
3.  **Coordinator:** The central component responsible for managing the transaction lifecycle.

**Functionality:**

The coordinator must support the following operations:

*   **`begin_transaction()`:** Initiates a new transaction and returns a unique transaction ID.
*   **`enlist_resource(transaction_id: UUID, node_id: String)`:** Adds a node as a participant in a given transaction. A node can only be enlisted once per transaction.
*   **`prepare(transaction_id: UUID, node_id: String) -> Result<bool, String>`:** Simulates the "prepare" phase.  The node signals whether it's ready to commit.  The function should return `Ok(true)` if the node is prepared, `Ok(false)` if the node wants to rollback, and `Err(String)` if the node wasn't enlisted in the transaction or if the transaction doesn't exist.
*   **`commit(transaction_id: UUID)`:** Initiates the commit phase. This function should only return `Ok` if *all* enlisted nodes have prepared successfully (returned `Ok(true)` in the prepare phase). If any node failed to prepare (returned `Ok(false)`), or if the transaction does not exist, the function should return `Err(String)`. Also, if a node was enlisted but `prepare` was never called, treat that as a failure to prepare.
*   **`rollback(transaction_id: UUID)`:** Initiates the rollback phase.  This function should return `Ok` regardless of the prepare status of the nodes. If the transaction does not exist, the function should return `Err(String)`.
*   **`get_transaction_state(transaction_id: UUID) -> Option<String>`:** Returns the current state of the transaction as a string (e.g., "Active", "Prepared", "Committed", "RolledBack", "Unknown"). Returns `None` if the transaction does not exist.

**Constraints and Edge Cases:**

*   **Transaction Isolation:**  Transactions should be isolated.  Operations on one transaction should not affect other transactions.
*   **Idempotency:** The `commit` and `rollback` operations should be idempotent. Calling them multiple times on a committed or rolled-back transaction should not result in an error, but also should not change the final state of the transaction.
*   **Concurrency:** The coordinator must be thread-safe and handle concurrent operations from multiple threads.
*   **Error Handling:**  Provide meaningful error messages for invalid operations (e.g., attempting to prepare a non-existent transaction, enlisting a node multiple times in the same transaction).
*   **Resource Management:** Design your solution to avoid memory leaks and efficiently manage resources.
*   **Performance:** The coordinator should be able to handle a large number of concurrent transactions and nodes. Optimize for read and write access to transaction data.

**Data Structures:**

You are free to choose suitable data structures for storing transaction information, node participation, and prepare status. Consider using data structures that provide efficient lookups and thread-safe access (e.g., `HashMap`, `RwLock`, `Arc`).

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Minimize lock contention to improve concurrency.
*   Optimize for read operations (e.g., `get_transaction_state`) as they are expected to be more frequent than write operations.

**Real-World Practical Scenarios:**

This problem simulates a crucial aspect of distributed systems, where maintaining data consistency across multiple services is essential. Understanding and implementing a DTC is fundamental for building reliable distributed applications.

**Multiple Valid Approaches with Different Trade-offs:**

Different approaches can be used to implement the DTC, each with its own trade-offs in terms of performance, complexity, and memory usage. Consider the following:

*   **Centralized Lock:** Using a single lock to protect the entire transaction state. Simple to implement but can lead to high contention.
*   **Fine-Grained Locking:** Using multiple locks to protect individual transactions or nodes. More complex but can improve concurrency.
*   **Lock-Free Data Structures:** Using atomic operations and lock-free data structures to avoid locks altogether. Most complex but can provide the best performance.

**Algorithmic Efficiency Requirements:**

*   `begin_transaction()`: O(1)
*   `enlist_resource()`: O(1) on average, assuming a good hash function for the data structures used.
*   `prepare()`: O(1) on average, assuming a good hash function for the data structures used.
*   `commit()`: O(N) where N is the number of enlisted nodes in the transaction.
*   `rollback()`: O(N) where N is the number of enlisted nodes in the transaction.
*   `get_transaction_state()`: O(1) on average, assuming a good hash function for the data structures used.

This problem requires a strong understanding of concurrency, data structures, and distributed systems principles. Good luck!

`NetworkPartitioning`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing an algorithm to determine the optimal way to partition a communication network to minimize disruption during a cyberattack. The network consists of `n` nodes, each representing a server. The connections between servers are represented as a graph, where an edge between two nodes indicates a direct communication link.

A cyberattack is anticipated that will compromise a subset of the servers. Your goal is to divide the network into `k` disconnected partitions *before* the attack. This will limit the spread of the attack by isolating compromised servers within their respective partitions.

Each server has a risk score, representing the likelihood of it being compromised by the attack. Each communication link also has a "fragility score," indicating how critical it is for overall network operation.

Your task is to write a function that takes the network graph, the risk scores of the nodes, the fragility scores of the edges, the number of partitions `k`, and a maximum partition size `max_size` as input, and returns a partitioning of the network that minimizes the potential disruption *after* the attack occurs.

The potential disruption is defined as the sum of the risk scores of *all* nodes in the largest, *fully compromised* partition, plus the sum of the fragility scores of all edges that are cut to form the partitions. A partition is "fully compromised" if *all* of its nodes are compromised.  You can assume that after the partitioning, the attack will compromise a subset of the nodes. Your algorithm must find a partitioning that minimizes the *worst case* disruption, assuming the attacker optimally chooses which nodes to compromise *after* the partitioning.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= n <= 1000). Nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1.
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, fragility)` represents an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v` with fragility score `fragility` (0 <= u, v < n, 0 <= fragility <= 1000).
*   `risk_scores`: A vector of integers, where `risk_scores[i]` represents the risk score of node `i` (0 <= risk_scores[i] <= 1000).
*   `k`: The number of partitions to create (1 <= k <= n).
*   `max_size`: The maximum number of nodes allowed in any single partition (1 <= max_size <= n).  Every partition's size must be <= `max_size`.

**Output:**

A vector of integers, where the i-th element represents the partition number assigned to node `i` (0 <= partition_id[i] < k).

**Constraints:**

*   Your solution must find a valid partitioning, meaning:
    *   Each node is assigned to exactly one partition.
    *   The number of partitions is exactly `k`.
    *   No partition has more than `max_size` nodes.
*   Your solution should aim to minimize the potential disruption as defined above. However, finding the absolute optimal solution may be computationally expensive.  Focus on finding a "good enough" solution within a reasonable time limit.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   The solution will be evaluated on a series of test cases with varying network topologies, risk scores, fragility scores, and values of `k` and `max_size`.
*   Efficiency is crucial. Solutions that are significantly slower than expected may time out. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize your solution.

**Example:**

```
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1, 10), (1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 12), (3, 4, 8), (0, 4, 3)]
risk_scores = [15, 8, 20, 5, 10]
k = 2
max_size = 3

Possible Output:
partition_id = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
```
(This is just one possible valid solution. The scoring system will evaluate the solution against other valid ones and pick the best solution)

**Notes:**

*   This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and careful consideration of edge cases.
*   Consider exploring techniques such as graph partitioning algorithms, simulated annealing, or genetic algorithms to find a near-optimal solution within the time constraints.
*   Think carefully about how to efficiently calculate the potential disruption for a given partitioning.
*   Pay attention to the constraints and edge cases to ensure your solution is robust and correct. A naive approach will likely time out.

Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test a wide range of skills, including data structures, algorithms, and optimization.

### Project Name

`NetworkOptimization`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and optimizing a communication network for a distributed system. The system consists of `n` nodes, each identified by a unique integer ID from `0` to `n-1`.  These nodes need to exchange data with each other. The network's performance is critical for the overall system's efficiency.

The network has the following characteristics:

*   **Node Capacity:** Each node `i` has a limited capacity, `capacity[i]`, representing the maximum amount of data it can process or transmit per unit of time.

*   **Data Flow:**  Data flow is directed.  A flow from node `i` to node `j` consumes resources at both nodes `i` and `j`.

*   **Connection Cost:**  There is a cost associated with establishing a direct connection between any two nodes `i` and `j`. This cost is given by a function `cost(i, j)`.

*   **Traffic Requirements:**  You are given a matrix `traffic[i][j]` indicating the minimum required data flow from node `i` to node `j` per unit of time.

*   **Latency:** The latency of a connection between node `i` and node `j` is given by a function `latency(i, j)`.

Your goal is to design a network topology (a set of direct connections between nodes) that satisfies the following constraints while minimizing the total **network cost** and **network latency**:

**Constraints:**

1.  **Capacity Constraint:** For each node `i`, the sum of all incoming and outgoing traffic must not exceed its `capacity[i]`.

2.  **Traffic Demand Constraint:** The network must be able to support at least the minimum required data flow `traffic[i][j]` between every pair of nodes `i` and `j`.  This can be achieved either through a direct connection from i to j, or through a path of intermediate nodes.

**Objective:**

Minimize: `Network_Cost + Network_Latency`

*   **Network Cost:**  The sum of the `cost(i, j)` for all direct connections in your chosen network topology.

*   **Network Latency:**  The weighted sum of latencies for each traffic pair.  For each `traffic[i][j]`, if there's a direct connection, the latency is `traffic[i][j] * latency(i, j)`. If the traffic flows through a path of intermediate nodes, the latency is `traffic[i][j] * (sum of latency of edges in the path)`. In case there are multiple paths, choose the path that minimizes latency for the (i, j) pair.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of nodes in the network (1 <= n <= 50).
*   `capacity`: A vector of integers, where `capacity[i]` is the capacity of node `i` (1 <= capacity[i] <= 1000).
*   `traffic`: A 2D vector of integers, where `traffic[i][j]` is the minimum required traffic from node `i` to node `j` (0 <= traffic[i][j] <= 50).
*   `cost(i, j)`: A function that returns the cost of a direct connection between node `i` and node `j` (1 <= cost(i, j) <= 100 for i != j, cost(i, i) = 0).
*   `latency(i, j)`: A function that returns the latency of a direct connection between node `i` and node `j` (1 <= latency(i, j) <= 100 for i != j, latency(i, i) = 0).

**Output:**

Return the minimum possible value of `Network_Cost + Network_Latency`. If it is impossible to satisfy the constraints, return `-1`.

**Constraints and Hints:**

*   The solution must be computationally efficient.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out. Consider using graph algorithms, dynamic programming, or heuristics.
*   You can assume the graph is fully connected, so the cost and latency functions are defined for all pairs of nodes.
*   The cost and latency functions may not be symmetric (i.e., `cost(i, j)` may not be equal to `cost(j, i)`).
* The traffic must be fully satisfied. If `traffic[i][j]` is 10, then the flow from node `i` to node `j` must be at least 10.
* Your solution will be evaluated based on its correctness, efficiency, and code quality.

This problem requires a combination of careful algorithm design, efficient data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

## Question: Optimizing Intergalactic Route Planning

**Problem Description:**

The Intergalactic Federation (IF) is building a high-speed transportation network between its member planets. Each planet has a unique identifier, a non-negative 64-bit integer.  The network consists of wormholes connecting pairs of planets. Each wormhole has an associated travel time, represented as a non-negative 32-bit integer, measured in galactic standard time units (GSTU).

Due to the inherent instability of wormholes, they are not always available.  The IF maintains a schedule for each wormhole, specifying active time windows.  Each time window is defined by a start time and end time, both represented as non-negative 64-bit integers, measured in GSTU since the Big Bang.  Travel through a wormhole is only possible during these active time windows. A journey *must* start within a time window, and the journey time (wormhole travel time) *must* complete before the time window closes.

Your task is to write a function that, given the network topology, wormhole schedules, a starting planet, a destination planet, and a departure time, calculates the minimum travel time required to reach the destination planet.

**Input:**

*   `num_planets`: The number of planets in the federation, represented as a `u32`. Planets are numbered from `0` to `num_planets - 1`.

*   `wormholes`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple represents a wormhole and contains the following information:
    *   `planet_a`: The identifier of the first planet connected by the wormhole (u32).
    *   `planet_b`: The identifier of the second planet connected by the wormhole (u32).
    *   `travel_time`: The travel time through the wormhole (u32).
    *   `schedule`: A vector of tuples representing the active time windows for the wormhole, where each tuple contains:
        *   `start_time`: The start time of the window (u64).
        *   `end_time`: The end time of the window (u64).

    Note: The wormhole is bidirectional, meaning travel is possible from planet A to B and from planet B to A. Also, there may be multiple wormholes connecting any two planets. The schedule for each wormhole can be unsorted and may contain overlapping time windows.

*   `start_planet`: The identifier of the starting planet (u32).
*   `destination_planet`: The identifier of the destination planet (u32).
*   `departure_time`: The earliest time at which travel can begin from the starting planet (u64).

**Output:**

*   Return an `Option<u64>` representing the minimum travel time required to reach the destination planet from the starting planet, starting no earlier than the `departure_time`. If the destination planet is unreachable or if overflow occurs during calculations, return `None`. The returned time is the time of arrival at the destination planet.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num_planets <= 100`
*   `0 <= number of wormholes <= num_planets * (num_planets - 1) / 2`
*   `0 <= travel_time <= 1000`
*   `0 <= start_time < end_time <= 2^63 - 1`
*   The graph (network of planets and wormholes) may not be fully connected.
*   The solution should be efficient in both time and space complexity.
*   The problem requires careful handling of potential integer overflows.

**Example:**

Let's say we have 2 planets (0 and 1), one wormhole connecting them with a travel time of 10 GSTU, and the wormhole is active between times 0-20 and 30-40.  If the starting planet is 0, the destination planet is 1, and the departure time is 5, then the minimum arrival time at planet 1 would be 15. If the departure time is 25, the minimum arrival time is 40. If the departure time is 41, the destination is unreachable, return `None`.

**Rust Signature:**

```rust
fn min_intergalactic_travel_time(
    num_planets: u32,
    wormholes: Vec<(u32, u32, u32, Vec<(u64, u64)>)>,
    start_planet: u32,
    destination_planet: u32,
    departure_time: u64,
) -> Option<u64> {
    // Your code here
}
```

Okay, I'm ready. Here's a challenging Rust coding problem:

## Project Title: Efficient Multi-Source Weighted Shortest Path Computation

### Question Description:

You are given a directed graph representing a communication network. Each node in the graph represents a server, and each edge represents a communication link between servers. Each link has a associated cost for transmit data between servers represented by weight.

Your task is to implement a highly efficient algorithm to compute the shortest (minimum cost) weighted path from *multiple* source servers to *all* other servers in the network. You are given a list of source server IDs.

**Input:**

*   `num_nodes`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, numbered from `0` to `num_nodes - 1`.
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v, weight)` represents a directed edge from server `u` to server `v` with weight `weight`. The weights are non-negative integers.
*   `sources`: A vector of integers representing the IDs of the source servers.

**Output:**

*   A vector of integers, `distances`, where `distances[i]` represents the shortest distance from any of the source servers to server `i`. If a server `i` is unreachable from any of the source servers, `distances[i]` should be set to `-1`.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Graph Size:** The graph can be large, with up to 10<sup>5</sup> nodes and 10<sup>6</sup> edges.
2.  **Weight Range:** Edge weights are non-negative integers within the range [0, 1000].
3.  **Number of Sources:** The number of source servers can be significant, potentially up to 10<sup>4</sup>.
4.  **Efficiency:** Your solution must be highly efficient in terms of both time and memory. A naive implementation (e.g., running Dijkstra's algorithm from each source individually) will likely time out. The target time complexity should be better than O(S \* N \* log N), where S is the number of sources and N is the number of nodes. Consider using advanced data structures and algorithmic optimizations.
5.  **Memory Limit:** Your solution must respect reasonable memory constraints. Avoid creating large intermediate data structures that could lead to memory exhaustion.
6.  **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the graph is disconnected, contains cycles, or has no edges. Ensure your algorithm correctly handles the case where a source server is unreachable from itself (should return 0).
7.  **Correctness:** Ensure your solution computes the correct shortest distances for all nodes, even in complex graph topologies.
8.  **Rust Specific:** Leverage Rust's memory safety and performance features to create a robust and fast implementation. Use appropriate data structures from the standard library and consider using crates for priority queues if necessary for performance.
9. **Non-negative weight:** All edge weights are guaranteed to be non-negative.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Think about how to efficiently initialize the distances from multiple sources simultaneously.
*   Explore the use of a priority queue (e.g., `BinaryHeap` in Rust's standard library, or a specialized crate for better performance) to efficiently select the next node to process.
*   Think about ways to optimize memory usage, such as using appropriate integer types and avoiding unnecessary copies of data.
*   Consider how to use a single priority queue when there are multiple source nodes, if appropriate.

This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and Rust's performance characteristics. Good luck!

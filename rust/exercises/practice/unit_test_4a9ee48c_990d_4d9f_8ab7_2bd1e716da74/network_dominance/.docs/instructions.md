Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to be difficult and require careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and optimization.

### Question Description

Imagine you are designing the core infrastructure for a new social network.  This network, unlike others, emphasizes the *influence* one user has over another.  Influence is represented by directed edges in a graph, where an edge from user A to user B signifies that A influences B.  A user can be influenced by multiple other users.

Your task is to determine the "dominant" users in this network.  A dominant user is defined as a user who, through their direct and indirect influence, can reach a significant portion of the network.

**Specifically:**

Given a directed graph representing the social network, where nodes are users (represented by unique integer IDs) and edges represent influence, and a "dominance threshold" `k`, determine the set of dominant users. A user is considered dominant if they can reach at least `k` other users (including themselves) through directed paths.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of users in the network (numbered from `0` to `n-1`).
*   `edges`: A vector of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a directed edge from user `u` to user `v`.
*   `k`: The dominance threshold - the minimum number of users a dominant user must influence (reach).

**Output:**

*   A sorted vector of integers representing the IDs of the dominant users in ascending order.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 100,000`
*   `0 <= number of edges <= 200,000`
*   `0 <= u, v < n` for each edge `(u, v)`
*   `1 <= k <= n`
*   The graph may contain cycles.
*   The graph may be disconnected.
*   Multiple edges between the same pair of nodes are possible (treat them as a single edge).
*   Self-loops are possible (an edge from a node to itself).

**Requirements:**

*   Your solution should be efficient, especially for larger graphs.  Consider the time and space complexity.  Naive solutions that repeatedly traverse the graph for each user will likely time out.
*   You must handle the case of cycles correctly.  Reachable nodes within a cycle should only be counted once.
*   The returned vector of dominant users must be sorted in ascending order.

**Considerations:**

*   Think about how to efficiently calculate the reachability from each node.
*   How can you avoid redundant computations when determining the reach of each user?
*   What data structures are most suitable for representing the graph and for tracking reachability?

This problem challenges you to think about graph algorithms, optimization techniques, and how to handle real-world graph characteristics. Good luck!

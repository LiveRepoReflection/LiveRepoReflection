Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem inspired by your request, aiming for LeetCode Hard difficulty.

**Project Name:** `DistributedLogAggregation`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed log aggregation system.  Imagine you have a cluster of `N` machines (numbered 0 to N-1) each generating log entries.  These log entries are timestamped (using Unix epoch time - seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) and contain a string message. The system's goal is to efficiently aggregate and query these logs across all machines within a specified time window.

Specifically, you need to implement the following functionality:

1.  **Log Ingestion:** Each machine can add new log entries to the system. The logs do not necessarily arrive in chronological order, and there might be duplicate timestamps.

2.  **Time-Windowed Querying:** Given a start timestamp `start_time` and an end timestamp `end_time`, return a list of all log messages within that time window, sorted lexicographically. You should return the log messages as a `Vec<String>`.

3.  **Scalability & Distribution:** The system must be designed to handle a large number of machines (`N` can be up to 100,000) and a high volume of log entries.  Consider how to distribute the data and computation for efficient querying.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** Assume machines can occasionally become unavailable. The system should still be able to return accurate (although potentially incomplete) results, prioritizing correctness over absolute completeness when a machine is down.  Ideally, the system should minimize the impact of a single machine failure.

**Constraints & Requirements:**

*   `N` (Number of machines): 1 <= N <= 100,000
*   Timestamps are Unix epoch seconds (non-negative integers) and fit within a `u64`.
*   Log messages are strings containing ASCII characters.  Maximum length of any single log message is 256 characters.
*   The system should be optimized for querying.  Ingestion speed is less critical but should still be reasonably efficient.
*   The query time window can vary significantly in size (from seconds to days).
*   Consider the trade-offs between memory usage, query speed, and fault tolerance.
*   Assume a reliable network connection between machines (i.e., network failures are less frequent than machine failures).
*   You are free to choose any appropriate data structures and algorithms to achieve the required functionality.
*   The system must be thread-safe.  Multiple machines might be adding logs concurrently.
*   The solution should be written in Rust.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and handling machine failures.
*   Introduce a configurable level of data redundancy to improve fault tolerance.
*   Implement a more sophisticated query interface, such as filtering by keywords or regular expressions.
*   Optimize for specific hardware configurations (e.g., SSD vs. HDD storage).
*   Consider how to handle time zones and daylight saving time.

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems principles, data structures, algorithms, and Rust's concurrency features.  There are multiple valid approaches, each with different trade-offs in terms of performance, memory usage, and complexity.  Good luck!

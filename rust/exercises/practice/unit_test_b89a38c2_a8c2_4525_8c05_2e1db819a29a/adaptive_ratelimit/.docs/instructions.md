## Problem: Distributed Rate Limiter with Adaptive Windowing

**Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service. This service is deployed across multiple nodes and is responsible for enforcing rate limits on incoming requests from various clients. The rate limits are defined per client (identified by a unique client ID) and specify the maximum number of requests allowed within a given time window.

The challenge lies in maintaining accurate rate limiting across a distributed environment while dynamically adapting the rate limiting window based on real-time traffic patterns and system load. The service must handle a high volume of requests with minimal latency and ensure fairness across different clients.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Counting:** Implement a mechanism to accurately track request counts for each client across all nodes in the distributed system. Atomic counters or distributed consensus algorithms are expected.

2.  **Adaptive Windowing:** The rate limiter should dynamically adjust the time window based on the following factors:

    *   **Overall System Load:** If the system is under heavy load (e.g., CPU utilization exceeds a threshold), the window size should decrease to become more strict.
    *   **Client Request Patterns:** If a client consistently sends requests at a rate significantly lower than its configured limit, the window size can increase to be more lenient and reduce the frequency of window resets.
    *   **Window Adjustment Granularity:** Implement a strategy to avoid overly aggressive or unstable window adjustments. Provide a mechanism to control the rate of change to prevent oscillations.

3.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limits for each client (requests per window) should be dynamically configurable and updateable without service restarts.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be resilient to node failures. The system should continue to function correctly even if some nodes become unavailable. Ensure that rate limit counters are persisted or can be recovered in case of node failure.

5.  **Low Latency:** The rate limiting decision (allow or reject request) should be made with minimal latency.

6.  **Fairness:** The rate limiter should ensure fairness across different clients, preventing a single client from monopolizing resources.

7.  **API:** Provide a simple API for clients to check if a request is allowed. The API should take the client ID as input and return a boolean indicating whether the request should be allowed or rejected.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of clients can be very large (millions).
*   The request rate can be very high (thousands or millions of requests per second).
*   The system consists of multiple nodes.
*   Network latency between nodes can vary.

**Considerations:**

*   Explore different data structures and algorithms for efficient counting and window management.
*   Consider different approaches to distributed consensus and coordination.
*   Analyze the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and scalability.
*   Think about the impact of clock synchronization issues in a distributed environment.
*   Consider the security implications of rate limiting, such as preventing abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   Address the cold start problem, or the initial state of the system.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems concepts, algorithm design, and Rust's concurrency features. Successful solutions will demonstrate a well-reasoned architecture, efficient algorithms, and robust error handling.

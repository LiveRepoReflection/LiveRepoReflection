## The Byzantine Agreement Simulator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with building a simulator for a simplified version of the Byzantine Generals Problem. In this scenario, a set of `n` generals (where `n` is odd) must agree on whether to attack or retreat. One of the generals is designated as the commander, and the rest are lieutenants. Some generals might be traitors who can send conflicting messages to different lieutenants or simply not follow the protocol. The goal is to design a system that maximizes the chances of the loyal lieutenants reaching a consensus decision, even in the presence of traitors.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Input:**
    *   `n`: An odd integer representing the total number of generals.
    *   `t`: An integer representing the maximum number of traitors among the generals. The input will always satisfy `3t + 1 <= n`.
    *   `commander_value`: A boolean value (true for "attack", false for "retreat") representing the commander's initial order.
    *   `traitors`: A `HashSet` (or equivalent Rust data structure) containing the indices (0 to n-1) of the traitorous generals. The commander is not guaranteed to be loyal.

2.  **Protocol:**
    Implement the following simplified Byzantine Agreement protocol:

    *   **Commander Sends Order:** The commander sends their order (`commander_value`) to all lieutenants. Traitorous commanders can send different orders to different lieutenants.
    *   **Lieutenants Relay Orders:** Each lieutenant relays the order they received from the commander to all other lieutenants. Traitorous lieutenants can send any order to any other lieutenant, regardless of what they received.
    *   **Majority Vote:** Each lieutenant counts the orders they received directly from the commander and the orders relayed from other lieutenants. The lieutenant then chooses the action (attack or retreat) that they received the most votes for. If there's a tie, the lieutenant defaults to "retreat".

3.  **Output:**

    *   A `HashMap` (or equivalent Rust data structure) where the keys are the indices of the loyal lieutenants (0 to n-1, excluding the commander's index and any traitors' indices), and the values are booleans representing their final decision (true for "attack", false for "retreat").

**Constraints:**

*   Your solution must handle the possibility that the commander is a traitor.
*   You must account for the fact that traitorous lieutenants can lie and send conflicting messages.
*   Your solution should be reasonably efficient. Avoid unnecessary computations or data structures.
*   Error handling: If the number of traitors `t` does not satisfy the condition `3t + 1 <= n`, return an error (e.g., a `Result` with an appropriate error enum).

**Optimization Goal:**

While correctness is paramount, aim to minimize the number of iterations or data structures used. Consider how to efficiently simulate the message passing and voting process.

**Real-World Relevance:**

This problem models a simplified version of distributed consensus, which is crucial in fault-tolerant systems, blockchain technology, and other distributed computing applications.

**Algorithmic Considerations:**

The core algorithm involves simulating message passing and performing a majority vote. Consider how to represent the messages and votes efficiently. The choice of data structures can significantly impact performance.

**Edge Cases:**

*   What happens when the commander is loyal and sends the same order to everyone?
*   What happens when the number of traitors is close to the maximum allowed?
*   What happens when there is a tie in the votes?
*   What if all the lieutenants are traitors?

This problem requires careful consideration of all possible scenarios and efficient implementation to achieve a robust and performant solution. Good luck!

Okay, I'm ready to set a challenging coding problem in Rust. Here it is:

## Project Name

`Distributed Consensus Log`

## Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, in-memory version of a distributed consensus log, inspired by systems like Raft or Paxos.  This log will be used by multiple nodes in a cluster to achieve agreement on a sequence of operations.

The system should support the following core features:

1.  **Log Entry Append:**  Nodes can propose new log entries to be appended to the log.  Each entry contains an opaque `payload` (a vector of bytes) and a `term` (an integer representing the current "term" of the consensus algorithm).  The entries are identified by the pair of `(term, index)` that is the consensus round number and the entry's location in the log.

2.  **Log Replication:**  The log must be replicated across multiple nodes.  Nodes can send requests to other nodes to replicate portions of their log.  A receiving node must check the incoming log entries for consistency with its own log.

3.  **Conflict Resolution:**  If a node receives a log entry that conflicts with an existing entry in its log (i.e., same index but different term), the receiving node must truncate its log starting from the conflicting entry.  Any subsequent entries must also be removed.

4.  **Commit Index:**  The system maintains a "commit index" which represents the index of the last log entry that has been agreed upon by a majority of nodes.  Entries up to the commit index are considered "committed" and can be safely applied.

5.  **Persistence Guarantee (Simplified):** While a real system would persist the log to disk, for this problem, you only need to ensure that committed entries are highly unlikely to be lost due to node failures. For the purpose of this exercise, assume that a separate mechanism exists to ensure that nodes that crash and restart can recover their state, as if from the beginning.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

*   **Concurrency:** The system *must* be thread-safe and handle concurrent requests from multiple nodes.  Use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Condvar`) to prevent data races and ensure consistency.
*   **Efficiency:**  The log implementation should be reasonably efficient.  Avoid unnecessary copying of data. Consider using appropriate data structures for efficient lookups and appends.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.  Return appropriate error types to indicate failures (e.g., inconsistent log entries, network errors â€“ though the network part is mocked).
*   **Immutability:** Once an entry is committed, it should be treated as immutable.
*   **In-Memory:**  The log should be stored in memory. You do not need to implement persistent storage.
*   **API Design:** Design a clear and concise API for the `Log` struct and its methods.

**Specific Instructions:**

1.  Implement a `Log` struct with the following methods (or similar, feel free to adjust for better design):

    *   `append(term: u64, payload: Vec<u8>) -> Result<u64, LogError>`: Appends a new log entry. Returns the new log index.
    *   `entries(start_index: u64, max_entries: usize) -> Result<Vec<(u64, u64, Vec<u8>)>, LogError>`: Returns a slice of log entries from `start_index` up to a maximum of `max_entries`. Each tuple in the returned `Vec` contains `(term, index, payload)`.
    *   `match_entries(entries: Vec<(u64, u64, Vec<u8>)>) -> Result<u64, LogError>`: Attempts to match a set of incoming log entries against the current log.  Returns the index of the last matching entry, or an error if there's a conflict. If the entries contain new entries, append them.
    *   `commit(index: u64) -> Result<(), LogError>`: Sets the commit index. Must ensure that the index exists and is valid.
    *   `last_log_term_index() -> (u64, u64)`: Returns the term and index of the last log entry.
    *   `last_committed_index() -> u64`: Returns the last committed index.

2.  Define appropriate error types in an `LogError` enum.

3.  Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness and concurrency safety of your implementation.  Focus on testing edge cases, conflict resolution scenarios, and commit index updates.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement a mechanism for detecting and preventing deadlocks.
*   Add support for log compaction (garbage collection of old, committed entries).
*   Implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution strategy.

This problem requires a good understanding of data structures, concurrency, and error handling in Rust. The concurrency aspect and the need for efficient data structures makes it significantly more challenging. Good luck!

## Question: Optimal Train Network Design

### Problem Description

You are tasked with designing an optimal train network connecting a set of cities. You are given a list of cities and a list of potential train routes between these cities. Each route has an associated cost (construction cost, maintenance cost, etc.) and a capacity (maximum number of trains per day).

Your goal is to design a train network that satisfies the following requirements:

1.  **Connectivity:** Every city must be reachable from every other city in the network, either directly or indirectly through other cities.

2.  **Minimum Capacity Requirement:** For each pair of cities (A, B), there must be enough capacity in the network to transport at least `K` trains per day between them. The capacity between two cities is defined as the maximum flow that can be sent between them in the constructed network.

3.  **Cost Minimization:** Among all networks satisfying the above requirements, you need to find the one with the minimum total cost.

You are given:

*   `n`: The number of cities, labeled from 0 to `n-1`.
*   `routes`: A list of tuples `(city_a, city_b, cost, capacity)`.
*   `K`: The minimum capacity requirement between any two cities.

Your task is to write a function `min_cost_train_network(n: usize, routes: &[(usize, usize, u64, u64)], k: u64) -> Option<u64>` that returns the minimum total cost of a train network satisfying the above requirements. If no such network exists, return `None`.

### Constraints and Considerations

*   `1 <= n <= 50` (Number of cities)
*   `0 <= routes.len() <= n * (n - 1) / 2` (Maximum possible routes between all cities)
*   `0 <= city_a, city_b < n`
*   `0 <= cost <= 10^9`
*   `0 <= capacity <= 10^9`
*   `0 <= K <= 10^9`
*   Cities are represented by integers for 0 to n-1.
*   The graph is undirected: a route `(a, b, cost, capacity)` implies a route `(b, a, cost, capacity)`.
*   Multiple routes may exist between the same pair of cities. You can choose any subset of these routes.
*   The input list of routes is not sorted.
*   The function should return `None` if it's impossible to create a valid network or if the input is invalid.

### Optimization Requirements

The solution should be efficient enough to handle the given constraints.  A brute-force approach will likely time out. Consider using appropriate graph algorithms and data structures. Bit manipulation may be useful.

### Example

```rust
let n = 4;
let routes = vec![
    (0, 1, 10, 5),
    (0, 2, 15, 3),
    (1, 2, 20, 7),
    (1, 3, 25, 2),
    (2, 3, 30, 9),
];
let k = 4;

let min_cost = min_cost_train_network(n, &routes, k);

println!("{:?}", min_cost); // Expected output: Some(65)
// Explanation:
// The optimal network includes the following routes:
// (0, 1, 10, 5)
// (1, 2, 20, 7)
// (2, 3, 30, 9)
// (0, 2, 15, 3) // needed to satisfy K = 4 for 0 <-> 3
// Total cost = 10 + 20 + 30 + 15 = 75. 
// However, without route (0,2,15,3) max flow between 0 and 3 is only 2 which is not enough for K=4.
```
```rust
let n = 3;
let routes = vec![
    (0, 1, 10, 5),
    (1, 2, 20, 7),
];
let k = 6;

let min_cost = min_cost_train_network(n, &routes, k);

println!("{:?}", min_cost); // Expected output: None
// Explanation:
// No possible connectivity and K requirements possible.
```

### Hints

*   Consider using a minimum spanning tree algorithm (e.g., Kruskal's or Prim's) as a starting point for ensuring connectivity.
*   Use maximum flow algorithms (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp) to check the minimum capacity requirement between all pairs of cities.
*   Think about how to efficiently iterate through all possible combinations of routes. Bit manipulation could be helpful here, or dynamic programming.
*   Be mindful of potential integer overflow issues, especially when dealing with costs and capacities.

Good luck!

Okay, here's a problem designed to be challenging, sophisticated, and suitable for a high-level programming competition in Rust:

### Question Description

You are tasked with implementing a simplified, in-memory distributed key-value store. This store consists of multiple nodes that communicate to achieve eventual consistency using a form of vector clocks.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Data Storage:** Each node in the distributed system stores key-value pairs. The values can be arbitrary byte arrays (`Vec<u8>`).

2.  **Vector Clocks:**  Each node maintains a vector clock.  The vector clock is an array of integers, where the *i*-th element represents the number of updates that the *i*-th node has made to its own data. Every update to the key-value store on a node increments the node's own entry in its vector clock.

3.  **Data Propagation:**  When a node updates a key-value pair, the updated value and its corresponding vector clock are propagated to other nodes.  Nodes must merge received updates with their local data.

4.  **Conflict Resolution:** When a node receives an update for a key it already has, it needs to resolve potential conflicts. Use the following logic:

    *   Compare the incoming vector clock with the local vector clock for that key.
    *   If the incoming vector clock is "greater than" the local vector clock, replace the local value with the incoming value.  A vector clock A is "greater than" vector clock B if for every index *i*, A\[*i*] >= B\[*i*], and there exists at least one index *j* such that A\[*j*] > B\[*j*].
    *   If the incoming vector clock is "less than" the local vector clock, discard the incoming value. A vector clock A is "less than" vector clock B if for every index *i*, A\[*i*] <= B\[*i*], and there exists at least one index *j* such that A\[*j*] < B\[*j*].
    *   If the vector clocks are "concurrent" (i.e., neither is greater than or less than the other), you have a conflict.  In the case of a conflict, keep **both** versions of the value, associating each with its respective vector clock.  The system should be able to return all concurrent versions of a value for a given key.

5.  **Node Discovery (Simplified):**  Assume a fixed number of nodes. Each node knows the IDs of all other nodes. You don't need to implement a full discovery service.

6.  **Asynchronous Communication:**  Simulate asynchronous communication between nodes.  You can use channels or similar mechanisms to represent messages being sent and received.  Messages can be delayed or delivered out of order.

7.  **Eventual Consistency:** The system should eventually converge to a consistent state, meaning that all nodes should eventually have the latest value (or all conflicting values) for each key.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Number of Nodes:** The number of nodes in the distributed system will be small (e.g., 3-5), but the solution should ideally be designed to scale reasonably.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially when handling conflicting values. Avoid unnecessary cloning of large data.
*   **Concurrency:** Your solution must be thread-safe and handle concurrent updates and data propagation correctly.
*   **Efficiency:**  Prioritize efficient vector clock comparisons.  Avoid unnecessary iterations.
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle potential network errors or node failures (though you don't need to fully implement fault tolerance).
*   **Performance:**  Optimize for read and write performance. Consider indexing strategies or data structures that allow for efficient retrieval of values and conflict resolution.
*   **Generics:** Your solution must be generic enough to allow for different serialization/deserialization mechanisms for the data (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers).

**Functionality to Implement:**

*   `Node::new(node_id: usize, total_nodes: usize)`:  Creates a new node with the given ID and total number of nodes in the system.
*   `Node::put(key: String, value: Vec<u8>)`:  Writes a key-value pair to the local store and propagates the update to other nodes.
*   `Node::get(key: String) -> Vec<(Vec<u8>, Vec<usize>)>`: Retrieves all versions of the value associated with the given key, along with their corresponding vector clocks.  Returns an empty vector if the key does not exist.
*   `Node::receive_update(key: String, value: Vec<u8>, vector_clock: Vec<usize>)`: Handles incoming updates from other nodes, performing conflict resolution as described above.
*   `Node::process_messages()`:  A method to simulate processing incoming messages from the network. This would likely involve consuming messages from a channel or queue.

**Judging Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the system correctly implement eventual consistency and conflict resolution?
*   **Efficiency:** How efficiently does the system handle reads and writes?
*   **Concurrency:** Is the solution thread-safe and free from race conditions?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Memory Usage:** Does the solution minimize memory usage, especially when handling conflicts?
*   **Scalability:**  While not directly tested at large scale, is the design reasonably scalable?

This problem requires a solid understanding of distributed systems concepts, concurrency, and data structures. It also demands careful attention to detail and optimization. Good luck!

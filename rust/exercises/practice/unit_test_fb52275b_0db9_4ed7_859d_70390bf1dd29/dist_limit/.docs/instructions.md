### Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter with the following requirements:

**Scenario:** Imagine you are building a large-scale, distributed system where various services need to interact with each other. To prevent abuse, ensure fair resource allocation, and maintain system stability, you need to implement a rate limiter.  This rate limiter needs to be highly available, scalable, and efficient.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must work correctly across multiple instances of your service. Requests originating from the same user/client, but hitting different service instances, must still be rate-limited correctly.

2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limits should be configurable on a per-user (or per-client) basis.  You should be able to define different rate limits for different users.  For example, User A might have a limit of 10 requests per second, while User B might have a limit of 100 requests per minute.

3.  **Atomic Operations:** The rate limiting logic must be atomic to avoid race conditions, especially when multiple requests arrive concurrently.

4.  **Efficiency:** The rate limiter must be efficient in terms of both memory usage and execution time.  Avoid unnecessary data duplication or complex computations. Latency is key.

5.  **Persistence:** The rate limiter's state (e.g., the number of requests made by a user in a given time window) must be persistent across service restarts.  Losing rate limiting data on service restarts could lead to abuse.

6.  **Time Window:** Implement a "sliding window" rate limiting algorithm.  This means that the rate limit is checked over a moving time window (e.g., the last second, the last minute, the last hour). It must be an *actual* sliding window, not a fixed window. Expired requests must be removed.

7.  **Granularity:** Provide millisecond precision for request timestamps.

8.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should be resilient to failures.  If a component of the rate limiter fails, it should not bring down the entire system. Consider using techniques such as replication or redundancy.

9.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be able to handle a large number of users and requests.

10. **Interface**: Implement a `RateLimiter` struct with a method `allow(user_id: &str) -> bool` that returns `true` if the request from the given user should be allowed, and `false` otherwise.

**Constraints:**

*   You are free to choose the underlying data store and concurrency mechanisms (e.g., Redis, a database with atomic operations, mutexes, channels). However, you must justify your choices and consider the trade-offs involved (performance, scalability, complexity).
*   Assume you have a mechanism for uniquely identifying users/clients (e.g., via an API key, user ID, IP address).
*   Focus on the core rate limiting logic and data structures.  You do not need to implement the entire distributed system.
*   The solution has to be *thread-safe*. Multiple threads will call the `allow()` method concurrently.
*   Consider the potential for clock skew across different service instances. Your rate limiter should be relatively robust to small clock differences.
*   You *must* avoid using global mutable state. All state must be encapsulated within the `RateLimiter` struct.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your solution will be judged on the following criteria:

*   **Correctness:** Does the rate limiter correctly enforce the specified rate limits?
*   **Performance:** Is the rate limiter efficient in terms of both memory usage and execution time?
*   **Scalability:** Can the rate limiter handle a large number of users and requests?
*   **Robustness:** Is the rate limiter resilient to failures and clock skew?
*   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   **Design Justification:** Are the design choices well-justified, considering the trade-offs involved?

Good luck!

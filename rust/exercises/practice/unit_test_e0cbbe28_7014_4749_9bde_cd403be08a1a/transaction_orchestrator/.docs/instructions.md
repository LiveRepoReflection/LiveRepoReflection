Okay, here's a challenging Rust coding problem designed to test advanced data structure knowledge, algorithmic efficiency, and attention to detail.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Orchestration

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator. Imagine a system where multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) need to participate in a single transaction. If any service fails to commit its part of the transaction, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

Your transaction coordinator must handle the following:

1.  **Transaction Definition:** A transaction consists of a set of *operations*. Each operation is associated with a specific *service*. An operation can either be a *commit* operation (to permanently apply a change) or a *rollback* operation (to undo a change). Each service knows how to execute its own commit and rollback operations based on a unique operation ID.

2.  **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol:** Implement the 2PC protocol to ensure atomicity:

    *   **Phase 1 (Prepare):** The coordinator sends a "prepare" message to each service involved in the transaction, asking if it is ready to commit the operation. The service attempts to prepare (e.g., write to a redo log, acquire necessary locks). The service responds with either "ready" or "abort".

    *   **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):**
        *   If *all* services respond with "ready", the coordinator sends a "commit" message to all services. The services then permanently commit their changes.
        *   If *any* service responds with "abort", or if the coordinator times out waiting for a response from a service, the coordinator sends a "rollback" message to all services. The services then undo their changes.

3.  **Concurrency and Deadlock Prevention:** The coordinator must be able to handle multiple concurrent transactions. Implement a deadlock detection and prevention mechanism. Services may acquire locks during the preparation phase. If a deadlock is detected, the coordinator should abort one of the involved transactions to break the cycle. Be mindful of resource contention and strive for efficient concurrency.

4.  **Durability:** The coordinator itself must be durable. It should be able to recover its state (in-flight transactions, participant status) after a crash or restart. You can simulate durability by writing transaction logs to a file.

5.  **Timeout Handling:** Implement timeouts for both the prepare and commit/rollback phases. If a service fails to respond within a reasonable timeframe, the coordinator should consider the service as having aborted the transaction. The timeout values should be configurable.

6.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for network communication failures, service crashes, and other potential issues.

**Input:**

The input to your transaction coordinator is a sequence of transaction definitions. Each transaction definition specifies:

*   A unique transaction ID (UUID).
*   A list of operations, where each operation is defined by:
    *   A service ID (String).
    *   An operation ID (UUID).
    *   The type of operation ("commit" or "rollback").

**Output:**

For each transaction, your coordinator should output whether the transaction was successfully committed or rolled back. If rolled back, provide a reason (e.g., service aborted, timeout, deadlock). Your output should be structured in a way that facilitates automated testing and analysis.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Performance:** The coordinator should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent transactions with minimal latency.  Consider using asynchronous programming to maximize throughput.
*   **Scalability:** The design should be scalable to a large number of services and transactions.
*   **Reliability:** The coordinator should be fault-tolerant and able to recover from failures.
*   **Rust Features:**  Utilize Rust's features effectively, including:
    *   Concurrency primitives (e.g., `Arc`, `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `async/await`).
    *   Error handling (`Result`, `?` operator).
    *   Smart pointers to manage memory safely.
    *   Traits for defining service interfaces.
*   **No external dependencies:** You are only allowed to use the standard library (std). This forces you to implement data structures and algorithms yourself.
*   **Memory safety:** The submitted solution must not have memory leaks or use unsafe code blocks.

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the coordinator correctly implement the 2PC protocol and ensure atomicity?
*   Concurrency: Does the coordinator handle concurrent transactions efficiently and prevent deadlocks?
*   Durability: Can the coordinator recover its state after a crash?
*   Performance: Is the coordinator performant and scalable?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Error Handling: Does the coordinator handle errors gracefully?
*   Adherence to Constraints: Does the solution adhere to all constraints and requirements?

This problem is designed to be open-ended and challenging, allowing for multiple valid approaches with different trade-offs. Good luck!

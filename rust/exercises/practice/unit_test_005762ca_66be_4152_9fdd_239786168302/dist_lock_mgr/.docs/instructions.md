## Project Name

`DistributedLockManager`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed lock manager in Rust. This lock manager will be used by multiple independent services (running on different machines) to coordinate access to shared resources, preventing race conditions and ensuring data consistency in a distributed environment.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Lock Acquisition and Release:** Implement functions to acquire and release locks. The acquire function should be blocking, waiting until the lock is available.
2.  **Reentrant Locks:** Implement reentrant locks, meaning a service that already holds a lock can acquire it again without blocking. The lock should only be released when the service has released it as many times as it acquired it.
3.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for lock acquisition. If a service cannot acquire a lock within a specified time, it should return an error.
4.  **Heartbeats:** Implement a heartbeat mechanism to prevent locks from being held indefinitely if a service crashes or becomes unresponsive while holding a lock. If a heartbeat is not received within a certain period, the lock should be automatically released.
5.  **Fairness:** Strive for fairness in lock acquisition. Services that have been waiting longer for a lock should be prioritized.
6.  **Concurrency:** The lock manager must be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple services efficiently.
7.  **Fault Tolerance:** Design the lock manager to be resilient to failures. Consider how data (lock ownership, heartbeats) can be persisted and recovered in case of a node failure. However, you don't need to implement a full RAFT consensus mechanism for this task. Assume a simple primary-backup setup where the primary periodically snapshots its state to a persistent storage (e.g., a file or database) that can be used by the backup to recover.
8.  **Performance:**  Optimize for low latency in lock acquisition and release.
9.  **Scalability:**  While you don't need to implement sharding or clustering in this exercise, consider how the design could be extended to handle a large number of services and locks.

**Constraints:**

*   The lock manager should be implemented as a standalone service. Services interact with it over a network using TCP.
*   Use Rust's standard library as much as possible. External dependencies should be minimized.
*   The solution should be thread-safe and memory-safe.
*   Error handling should be robust and informative.
*   Assume a moderately unreliable network. Connections can drop or become temporarily unavailable.
*   The lock names are arbitrary strings.

**Input/Output:**

The lock manager service should accept TCP connections and handle the following commands:

*   `ACQUIRE <lock_name> <service_id> <timeout_ms>`: Attempts to acquire the lock named `<lock_name>` on behalf of service `<service_id>`.  `<timeout_ms>` specifies the timeout in milliseconds.
*   `RELEASE <lock_name> <service_id>`: Releases the lock named `<lock_name>` held by service `<service_id>`.
*   `HEARTBEAT <lock_name> <service_id>`: Sends a heartbeat for the lock named `<lock_name>` held by service `<service_id>`.

The lock manager service should respond with:

*   `OK`: Operation successful.
*   `ERROR <message>`: Operation failed with the specified error message.

**Example Scenario:**

1.  Service A requests to acquire lock "resource1" with a timeout of 1000ms.
2.  The lock is available.
3.  The lock manager grants the lock to Service A and sends `OK`.
4.  Service B requests to acquire lock "resource1" with a timeout of 500ms.
5.  The lock is held by Service A.
6.  Service B waits for up to 500ms.
7.  Service A sends a heartbeat for lock "resource1".
8.  Service A releases lock "resource1".
9.  The lock manager grants the lock to Service B and sends `OK`.

**Bonus Points:**

*   Implement a command to check the status of a lock (e.g., who holds it).
*   Implement a command to force-release a lock (for administrative purposes).  This should require authentication.
*   Implement a basic web UI to monitor the lock manager's status.
*   Improve fault tolerance by implementing a more robust consensus algorithm (e.g., Paxos or Raft).

This problem requires a deep understanding of concurrency, networking, data structures, and system design principles. A well-designed solution should be efficient, reliable, and scalable.

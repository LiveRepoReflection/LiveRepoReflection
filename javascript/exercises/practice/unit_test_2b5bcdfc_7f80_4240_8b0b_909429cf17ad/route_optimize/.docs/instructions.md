Okay, here's a challenging Javascript coding problem designed with the constraints you requested.

**Project Name:** `OptimalRoutePlanner`

**Question Description:**

A large logistics company, "GlobalTransit," operates a vast network of interconnected distribution centers across a country.  Each distribution center has a finite storage capacity and handles a specific set of product types.  GlobalTransit needs to optimize its routing of goods between these centers to satisfy fluctuating demand while minimizing transportation costs and respecting storage limits.

You are tasked with developing an `OptimalRoutePlanner` class in JavaScript that can determine the most cost-effective route for transporting a specific product from a source distribution center to a destination distribution center, given the following constraints:

**Input:**

*   `network`: An object representing the distribution center network.  It has the following structure:

    ```javascript
    {
      centers: {
        "centerA": { // Center ID (String)
          capacity: 100, // Maximum storage capacity (Integer)
          products: ["productX", "productY"], // Array of product types handled (Array of Strings)
          transportCosts: { // Cost to transport products to other centers
            "centerB": { // Destination Center ID (String)
              "productX": 5, // Cost to transport productX (Integer)
              "productY": 7  // Cost to transport productY (Integer)
            },
            "centerC": {
              "productX": 8
            }
          }
        },
        "centerB": { ... },
        "centerC": { ... }
      },
      initialInventory: { //optional, if not specified, assume all the products' initial quantities are 0
        "centerA": { // Center ID (String)
            "productX": 20, // Quantity of productX (Integer)
            "productY": 30, // Quantity of productY (Integer)
        },
        "centerB": { ... },
        "centerC": { ... }
      }
    }
    ```

*   `source`: The ID (String) of the distribution center where the product originates.

*   `destination`: The ID (String) of the distribution center where the product needs to be delivered.

*   `product`: The type of product (String) to be transported.

*   `quantity`: The amount (Integer) of the product to be transported.

**Requirements and Constraints:**

1.  **Capacity Constraint:**  The quantity of each product in each distribution center (including the source and any intermediate centers) must **never** exceed its capacity at any point during the transportation process.  Assume the quantity of product can be added to the center before it is transported from the center.

2.  **Product Handling Constraint:** A distribution center can only handle products listed in its `products` array.  A route is invalid if it includes a center that does not handle the requested `product`.

3.  **Cost Minimization:**  The goal is to find the route with the lowest total transportation cost.  The cost is determined by summing the `transportCosts` for the specified `product` between each connected center in the route.

4.  **Inventory Management:**  The solution *must* take into account the `initialInventory` of each product at each center. If a center doesn't have enough inventory to fulfill the product to be transported, the function should return `null`.

5.  **Directed Graph:** Transportation costs may be asymmetric (the cost from A to B may not be the same as the cost from B to A, or a route may exist in only one direction).

6.  **No Negative Cycles:** Assume there are no negative cost cycles in the transportation network.

7.  **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient enough to handle networks with up to 100 distribution centers and a reasonable number of connections between them.  Consider time complexity when choosing your approach.

8.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   If no route exists between the source and destination that satisfies the constraints, return `null`.
    *   If the source and destination are the same, return an object with the route as an array containing only the source and cost of 0.
    *   The product may not exist at the source or be handled at the destination. You must handle these cases gracefully and return `null`.

**Output:**

If a valid route is found, return an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  route: ["centerA", "centerB", "centerD"], // Array of center IDs representing the optimal route
  cost: 12 // Total transportation cost for the route
}
```

If no valid route is found, return `null`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const network = {
  centers: {
    "A": { capacity: 50, products: ["X"], transportCosts: { "B": { "X": 10 } }, },
    "B": { capacity: 50, products: ["X", "Y"], transportCosts: { "C": { "X": 15, "Y": 5 } } },
    "C": { capacity: 50, products: ["X"], transportCosts: {} }
  },
  initialInventory: {
      "A": { "X": 20 }
  }
};

const source = "A";
const destination = "C";
const product = "X";
const quantity = 10;

const planner = new OptimalRoutePlanner();
const result = planner.findOptimalRoute(network, source, destination, product, quantity);

// Expected Output: { route: ["A", "B", "C"], cost: 25 }
```

**Class Signature:**

```javascript
class OptimalRoutePlanner {
  /**
   * Finds the optimal route for transporting a product between distribution centers.
   * @param {object} network The distribution center network.
   * @param {string} source The ID of the source distribution center.
   * @param {string} destination The ID of the destination distribution center.
   * @param {string} product The type of product to be transported.
   * @param {number} quantity The amount of the product to be transported.
   * @returns {object | null} An object containing the route and cost, or null if no route is found.
   */
  findOptimalRoute(network, source, destination, product, quantity) {
    // Your code here
  }
}
```

This problem requires a combination of graph traversal, cost optimization, and constraint satisfaction.  Good luck!

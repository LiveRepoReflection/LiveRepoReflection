## Problem: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

**Question Description:**

You are given a set of `n` tasks to be scheduled on a single processor. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id[i]`: A unique integer identifier for the task.
*   `duration[i]`: The amount of time (in arbitrary units) required to complete the task.
*   `deadline[i]`: The time (in the same units as duration) by which the task must be completed.
*   `dependencies[i]`: A list of task `id`s that must be completed before task `i` can start.

Your goal is to find a schedule (an ordering of the tasks) that minimizes the maximum lateness of any task. The lateness of a task is defined as `max(0, completion_time - deadline)`, where `completion_time` is the time at which the task is finished. If a task's completion time is before its deadline, its lateness is 0.

However, generating the absolute best schedule to minimize the maximum lateness is not always possible. You are also given a `penaltyWeight` for each time unit a task is late. You must find a schedule of tasks that minimizes the total penalty across all tasks. Total penalty is defined as `sum(lateness[i] * penaltyWeight)`.

**Constraints:**

1.  **Task IDs:** Task IDs are integers from `0` to `n-1`.
2.  **Dependencies:** Dependencies must be satisfied. A task cannot start until all its dependencies have been completed. If a dependency is circular, the problem is unsolvable, and you should return `null`.
3.  **Deadlines and Durations:** Durations and deadlines are non-negative integers.
4.  **Optimization:** Find the schedule that minimizes the total penalty for lateness.
5.  **Tie-breaking:** If multiple schedules result in the same minimum total penalty, return the lexicographically smallest schedule (i.e., the schedule that comes first alphabetically when the task IDs are treated as characters). For example, `[0, 1, 2]` is lexicographically smaller than `[0, 2, 1]`.
6.  **Large Input:** The number of tasks `n` can be up to 100. A brute-force approach will likely time out.
7.  **Complexity Consideration**: Your function must execute within a reasonable time limit. Solutions with exponential time complexity are unlikely to pass all test cases.
8.  **Memory consideration**: You should design an algorithm that is reasonably efficient in memory usage. Avoid storing unnecessary large intermediate data structures that could lead to memory exhaustion.

**Input:**

An array of `n` task objects, where each object has the following structure:

```javascript
{
  id: number,
  duration: number,
  deadline: number,
  dependencies: number[]
}
```

`penaltyWeight: number` represents how much each time unit of lateness will affect the total penalty.

**Output:**

An array of task `id`s representing the optimal schedule. If no valid schedule exists (due to circular dependencies), return `null`.

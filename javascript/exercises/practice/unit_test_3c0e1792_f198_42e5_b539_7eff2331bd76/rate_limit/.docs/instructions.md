Okay, here's a challenging and sophisticated JavaScript coding problem:

## Project Name

```
distributed-rate-limiter
```

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter service using JavaScript. This service needs to handle a high volume of requests and accurately enforce rate limits across a cluster of servers.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Functionality:** The rate limiter should allow you to define rate limits based on different keys (e.g., user ID, IP address, API key). You should be able to define limits like "100 requests per minute per user" or "1000 requests per hour per IP address".  The service should accurately track request counts and reject requests that exceed the defined limits.

2.  **Distribution:** The rate limiter must work correctly in a distributed environment, where multiple instances of the rate limiter service are running concurrently.  Requests for the same key might be routed to different instances.

3.  **Consistency:**  Despite the distributed nature, the rate limits must be enforced consistently. A user should not be able to exceed their rate limit by making requests that are routed to different rate limiter instances.

4.  **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a high volume of requests. You need to consider how your design scales as the number of users and requests increases.

5.  **Concurrency:** The rate limiter must handle concurrent requests efficiently and avoid race conditions that could lead to inaccurate rate limiting.

6.  **Persistence:** The rate limit counts should be persisted in a durable manner. If a rate limiter instance crashes or restarts, it should be able to recover the request counts and continue enforcing the limits correctly.

7.  **Time Window Management:** Implement a sliding window approach for rate limiting.  This means that the request count for a particular time window (e.g., the last minute) should be calculated based on the requests that have occurred within that window, rather than using fixed time intervals.

8.  **Error Handling:**  Provide proper error handling and logging. The system should be able to gracefully handle errors such as connection failures, invalid rate limit configurations, and unexpected data corruption.

9.  **Optimizations:** Prioritize efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize latency and resource consumption. The rate limiter should introduce minimal overhead to the request processing pipeline.

**Constraints:**

*   You can use any external libraries or databases (e.g., Redis, Memcached, a distributed SQL database, etc.). Justify your choices based on performance, scalability, and reliability.
*   Focus on the core rate limiting logic and data management. You don't need to implement a full-fledged API gateway or authentication system.
*   Assume that the keys used for rate limiting (e.g., user IDs, IP addresses) are strings.
*   The time windows for rate limits are in seconds.
*   Assume a maximum number of rate limit configurations.  This is needed for memory management.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the rate limiter accurately enforce the defined limits in a distributed environment?
*   Performance: How quickly can the rate limiter process requests?
*   Scalability: How well does the system scale as the number of users and requests increases?
*   Concurrency: Does the rate limiter handle concurrent requests efficiently and avoid race conditions?
*   Durability: Does the rate limiter persist request counts and recover from failures?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Justification: Are the design choices well-justified based on the requirements and constraints?

This problem requires a good understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, data structures, and algorithms. Good luck!

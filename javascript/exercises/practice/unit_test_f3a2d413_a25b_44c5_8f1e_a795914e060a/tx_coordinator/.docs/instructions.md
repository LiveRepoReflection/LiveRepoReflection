Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem description, designed to be LeetCode Hard level.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Transaction Coordinator

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator for a system consisting of multiple microservices. This system supports atomic transactions that span across these microservices.  Each microservice exposes an API with two key functions: `prepare(transactionId, data)` and `commit(transactionId)`. The `prepare` function attempts to tentatively apply the changes described in `data` associated with a given `transactionId`.  It returns `true` if the microservice is prepared to commit and `false` if it cannot prepare (due to validation failures, resource constraints, etc.).  The `commit` function permanently applies the changes associated with the `transactionId`.

Your transaction coordinator should implement the following functions:

*   `begin()`: Starts a new transaction. Returns a unique `transactionId`.
*   `enlist(transactionId, serviceEndpoint)`:  Adds a microservice endpoint (`serviceEndpoint`) to the transaction identified by `transactionId`.  `serviceEndpoint` is an object containing the `prepare` and `commit` functions described above (e.g., `{ prepare: (transactionId, data) => ..., commit: (transactionId) => ... }`). You can assume the services can be reached and won't suddenly disappear during the transaction.
*   `setData(transactionId, serviceEndpoint, data)`: Associates the data with a `serviceEndpoint` within a specific transaction, to be used in the prepare call.
*   `commitTransaction(transactionId)`: Attempts to commit the transaction. It performs the following steps:

    1.  **Prepare Phase:** For each enlisted service, call its `prepare` function *concurrently* with the associated data.  The transaction coordinator must wait for all `prepare` calls to complete.
    2.  If *all* `prepare` calls return `true`, proceed to the commit phase.
    3.  If *any* `prepare` call returns `false`, abort the transaction by rolling back. Implement rollback by calling each service's `commit` function with transactionId and a `rollback` flag set to `true` *concurrently*.
    4.  **Commit Phase:** If all `prepare` calls succeeded, call each service's `commit` function with transactionId *concurrently*.
    5.  Return `true` if the transaction committed successfully (all prepares were successful and all commits completed without error). Return `false` if the transaction was aborted.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Concurrency:** The `prepare` and `commit` calls to the microservices *must* be executed concurrently to minimize latency. Use appropriate JavaScript concurrency mechanisms (e.g., `Promise.all`, `async/await`).
*   **Atomicity:** The transaction must be atomic. Either all services commit, or all services rollback.
*   **Idempotency:**  The `commit` function in microservices is assumed to be idempotent. Meaning that calling them repeatedly with the same arguments is safe and has the same effect as calling them once.
*   **Error Handling:**  You must handle potential errors during the `prepare` and `commit` phases.  If a `prepare` call throws an error, treat it as a `false` return. If a `commit` call throws an error, log the error, and continue with the rest of the commit/rollback operations. An error in commit should **not** cause the entire transaction to fail.
*   **Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for both `prepare` and `commit` calls. If a service doesn't respond within a specified timeout (e.g., 500ms), treat the `prepare` as a `false` and log the error. If the `commit` does not respond to timeout, log the error.
*   **Resource Management:**  Ensure that you are not leaking resources (e.g., unhandled promises) when handling errors or timeouts.
*   **Scalability:** Design your solution with scalability in mind.  Avoid blocking operations that could limit the throughput of the transaction coordinator.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** All external calls (`prepare` and `commit`) are inherently asynchronous. Your coordinator must handle this correctly.

**Input:**

*   `serviceEndpoint`: An object with `prepare` and `commit` functions.
*   `data`: Arbitrary data to be passed to the `prepare` function.

**Output:**

*   `begin()`: Returns a unique transaction ID (a string).
*   `commitTransaction(transactionId)`: Returns `true` if the transaction committed successfully, `false` otherwise.

This problem requires careful consideration of concurrency, error handling, and timeout mechanisms. It's designed to be a challenging exercise in asynchronous JavaScript programming and system design principles. Good luck!

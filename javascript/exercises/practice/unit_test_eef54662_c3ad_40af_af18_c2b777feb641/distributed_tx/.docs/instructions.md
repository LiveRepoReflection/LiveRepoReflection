Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem description, focusing on a complex real-world scenario and incorporating advanced concepts.

## Question: Distributed Transaction Orchestrator

### Project Name

`distributed-tx`

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a simplified version of a distributed transaction orchestrator. In a distributed system, ensuring data consistency across multiple services is crucial. This problem focuses on orchestrating transactions across several independent services.

Imagine you have a system managing user accounts, order processing, and inventory. Each of these is handled by a separate service. A typical operation, like placing an order, requires actions from all three:

1.  **Account Service:** Reserves funds from the user's account.
2.  **Order Service:** Creates a new order record.
3.  **Inventory Service:** Decreases the stock of the ordered items.

All these steps need to happen atomically. Either all succeed, or all are rolled back to maintain consistency. You'll implement a transaction orchestrator to manage this process.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Service Simulation:** Create a simplified simulation of the Account, Order, and Inventory services. Each service will expose a function `process(transactionId, data)` that simulates a successful operation and a function `compensate(transactionId, data)` that simulates a rollback. These functions should also simulate potential failures (e.g., network issues) by randomly throwing errors.

2.  **Transaction Orchestrator:** Implement a class `TransactionOrchestrator` with the following methods:

    *   `beginTransaction(services, transactionData)`: Takes an array of service objects (each with `process` and `compensate` methods) and some transaction-specific data. It returns a `transactionId`.

    *   `executeTransaction(transactionId)`: Executes the transaction in a defined order (Account -> Order -> Inventory). For each service, it calls the `process` method. If any `process` call fails, it should trigger a rollback of all previously processed services in *reverse* order.

    *   `getTransactionState(transactionId)`: Returns the current state of the transaction. This can be 'PENDING', 'COMMITTED', or 'ROLLED_BACK'.

3.  **Idempotency:** The `process` and `compensate` methods of each service should be idempotent. This means that if called multiple times with the same `transactionId`, they should only perform the action once and return the same result (or no-op if already completed).

4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to deal with service failures during both the forward processing and rollback phases.  If a `compensate` call fails, the orchestrator should retry the compensation a certain number of times (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff). If compensation continues to fail after retries, log the error and proceed with rollback of other services.

5.  **Asynchronous Operation:** Simulate asynchronous service calls using `setTimeout` or `Promises`.

6.  **Concurrency:**  The orchestrator should be designed to handle multiple concurrent transactions. Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, queues) to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

7.  **Optimization:**  Implement a mechanism to detect and avoid unnecessary compensations. For example, if the Inventory Service fails *before* the Order Service is processed, there's no need to compensate the Order Service.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of services involved in a transaction can vary.
*   Service `process` and `compensate` methods can have different latency and failure rates.
*   The transaction orchestrator should be highly available and fault-tolerant (within the scope of this simplified problem).
*   Minimize the impact on the user experience in case of failures.

**Considerations:**

*   How will you handle timeouts for service calls?
*   How will you ensure the order of operations during both the forward processing and rollback phases?
*   How will you design the `transactionData` structure to be flexible enough to accommodate different types of transactions?
*   How will you monitor the health and performance of the transaction orchestrator?

This problem requires a strong understanding of asynchronous programming, error handling, concurrency, and distributed systems principles. It challenges the solver to design a robust and efficient transaction orchestrator that can handle various failure scenarios.  The idempotency and retry mechanisms add significant complexity. Good luck!

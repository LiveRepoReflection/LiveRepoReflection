**Distributed Rate Limiter**

## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter in JavaScript that adheres to the following specifications:

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building a popular online service that is susceptible to abuse. You need a robust mechanism to limit the number of requests a user can make within a specific time window to prevent denial-of-service attacks, account abuse, and ensure fair resource allocation. This rate limiter must work across multiple servers in a distributed environment.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Functionality:**

    *   Implement a `rateLimit(userId, requestCost)` function that accepts a `userId` (string, representing a unique user identifier) and a `requestCost` (integer, representing the cost/complexity of the current request). It should return a boolean value: `true` if the request is allowed (within the rate limit), and `false` if the request is blocked (exceeds the rate limit).
    *   The rate limiter should support different request costs. A complex operation might deduct more from the user's allowance than a simple one.
    *   The rate limiter should allow burst traffic up to a certain point.

2.  **Configuration:**

    *   The rate limiter should be configurable with the following parameters:
        *   `timeWindow`: The duration of the rate limiting window in milliseconds (e.g., 60000 for 1 minute).
        *   `capacity`: The maximum request cost a user can accumulate within the `timeWindow` (e.g., 100).
        *   `redisHost`: The hostname of the Redis server.
        *   `redisPort`: The port of the Redis server.
        *   `replenishRate`: The rate at which the user's allowance is replenished, measured in units/millisecond (e.g., 100/60000 for refilling 100 units every minute.) This is to ensure that request cost isn't just depleted but also partially re-credited.

3.  **Distributed Operation:**

    *   The rate limiter must function correctly across multiple instances of your service.  Use Redis as a central, shared data store to maintain rate limit state for each user.
    *   Ensure atomicity when updating the user's allowance in Redis to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

4.  **Concurrency:**

    *   Your solution must handle concurrent requests efficiently.

5.  **Optimization:**

    *   Optimize for read and write operations to Redis to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Consider techniques like pipelining or batching where appropriate.
    *   Minimize the amount of data stored in Redis.

6.  **Error Handling:**

    *   Gracefully handle Redis connection errors. The rate limiter should continue to function (perhaps by temporarily allowing all requests or using a fallback mechanism) in case of Redis unavailability. Implement a retry mechanism for Redis operations.

7.  **Edge Cases and Constraints:**

    *   Handle cases where `userId` is null, undefined, or empty.
    *   Handle cases where `requestCost` is zero or negative.
    *   Consider how to handle users who have never made a request before (cold start).
    *   Ensure that your solution handles time synchronization issues between different servers gracefully.
    *   The `userId` should not be excessively long to prevent excessive Redis key sizes.
    *   Avoid using blocking operations that could impact the performance of your service.

8. **Algorithmic Efficiency:**

    * Try to make sure your algorithm minimizes the request to Redis as many times as possible.

**Deliverables:**

Provide a JavaScript implementation of the `rateLimit` function, along with any necessary helper functions and Redis connection management logic. Clearly document your design choices, including the data structures used in Redis and the reasoning behind your optimization strategies.

**Bonus:**

*   Implement a mechanism to dynamically update the rate limiting configuration (e.g., `timeWindow`, `capacity`, `replenishRate`) without restarting the service.
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the rate limiter's performance (e.g., request throughput, Redis latency, error rates).
*   Explore different rate limiting algorithms (e.g., Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window Counter) and justify your choice.

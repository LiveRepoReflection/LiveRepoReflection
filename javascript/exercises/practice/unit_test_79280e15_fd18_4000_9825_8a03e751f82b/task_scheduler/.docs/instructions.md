## Problem: Optimal Task Scheduling with Dependencies and Deadlines

You are given a set of tasks that need to be scheduled for execution on a single processor. Each task has the following properties:

*   **id:** A unique identifier for the task (integer).
*   **executionTime:** The time (in milliseconds) required to execute the task (integer).
*   **deadline:** The deadline (in milliseconds) by which the task must be completed (integer).  Deadlines are relative to time 0.
*   **dependencies:** A list of task IDs that must be completed before this task can start.  A task cannot start execution until all of its dependencies have been met.

Your goal is to determine the optimal schedule that maximizes the number of tasks completed by their deadlines.  "Optimal" in this case means selecting the tasks and their order that result in the most completed tasks before their deadlines.

**Input:**

*   `tasks`: An array of task objects, each with the properties described above.
*   `currentTime`: The current time (in milliseconds). This represents the starting point for your schedule.

**Output:**

An array of task IDs representing the order in which the tasks should be executed. This schedule should maximize the number of tasks completed by their deadlines, considering dependencies. If a task cannot be completed by its deadline after considering the dependencies, it should not be scheduled.  Prioritize tasks with earlier deadlines when multiple tasks are available. If two tasks share the same deadline, prioritize based on the number of dependencies (fewer dependencies first). If they share the same number of dependencies, prioritize based on task id (smaller task id first).

**Constraints:**

*   You must use Javascript.
*   The input array `tasks` can be very large (up to 10,000 tasks).
*   Task IDs are unique and are integers.
*   `executionTime` and `deadline` are positive integers.
*   Circular dependencies are possible.  If circular dependencies exist, tasks involved in the cycle *cannot* be scheduled.
*   The solution should be reasonably efficient.  A naive brute-force approach will likely time out for larger input sets. Consider time complexity.
*   The output array should only contain tasks that can be completed on time given the schedule, including the execution time of tasks that come before it in the schedule.
*   Tasks that cannot be completed by their deadlines, or have dependencies that will never be met, should not be included in the returned schedule.
*   The schedule must respect all dependencies.

**Example:**

```javascript
const tasks = [
  { id: 1, executionTime: 10, deadline: 20, dependencies: [] },
  { id: 2, executionTime: 15, deadline: 50, dependencies: [1] },
  { id: 3, executionTime: 5, deadline: 30, dependencies: [] },
  { id: 4, executionTime: 8, deadline: 40, dependencies: [3] },
];
const currentTime = 0;

// Possible optimal schedule: [1, 3, 4, 2]
// Another valid schedule: [3, 1, 4, 2]
```

**Challenge:**

Implement an efficient algorithm to find the optimal task schedule according to the constraints described above. Consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize for performance and correctness. Handle edge cases gracefully.

Okay, here's a challenging Javascript coding problem designed with complexity, optimization, and real-world considerations in mind.

### Project Name

`OptimalNetworkPartitioning`

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing an algorithm to partition a large communication network into smaller, independent sub-networks. The goal is to minimize the disruption to communication flow while adhering to strict security constraints.

The communication network is represented as an undirected graph where:

*   **Nodes:** Represent individual devices (e.g., servers, routers, IoT devices). Each node has a unique integer ID and a `securityLevel` (integer from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the least secure and 10 is the most secure).
*   **Edges:** Represent communication links between devices. Each edge has a `bandwidth` (integer representing the maximum data transfer rate).

You are given the following inputs:

1.  `nodes`: An array of objects, where each object represents a node in the network.  Each object has the following properties: `{ id: number, securityLevel: number }`.
2.  `edges`: An array of objects, where each object represents an edge in the network. Each object has the following properties: `{ source: number, target: number, bandwidth: number }`.  `source` and `target` refer to the `id` of the connected nodes.
3.  `partitionSize`:  An integer representing the desired (or maximum) size of each sub-network. The sub-networks do not have to be exactly this size, but should be as close to this size as possible without exceeding it. Some sub-networks may be smaller if the total network size is not perfectly divisible.
4.  `minSecurityLevel`: An integer representing the minimum acceptable security level for *any* node within *any* sub-network.  If a node's `securityLevel` is below this value, it *must* be isolated into its own sub-network of size 1.

Your algorithm must output an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a sub-network and contains the `id`s of the nodes belonging to that sub-network.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Security Constraint:**  Nodes with a `securityLevel` less than `minSecurityLevel` *must* be in their own sub-network (size 1). This constraint is non-negotiable.
*   **Size Constraint:** No sub-network can have more than `partitionSize` nodes.
*   **Connectivity (Optimization Goal):**  The partitioning should minimize the total bandwidth of the edges that are *cut* (i.e., edges that connect nodes in different sub-networks).  This aims to preserve as much of the original network's communication capacity as possible.
*   **Efficiency:** The algorithm should be efficient for large networks (thousands of nodes and edges).  Consider the time and space complexity of your solution.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out.
*   **Multiple Valid Solutions:** There might be multiple valid partitionings that satisfy the constraints. Your algorithm should aim to find one that minimizes the bandwidth cut.
*   **Disconnected Graphs:** The input graph may not be fully connected.
*   **Error Handling:** If it's impossible to satisfy the security constraint (e.g., `minSecurityLevel` is higher than the `securityLevel` of *all* nodes), the function should return `null`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const nodes = [
  { id: 1, securityLevel: 3 },
  { id: 2, securityLevel: 8 },
  { id: 3, securityLevel: 9 },
  { id: 4, securityLevel: 2 },
  { id: 5, securityLevel: 7 },
  { id: 6, securityLevel: 6 }
];

const edges = [
  { source: 1, target: 2, bandwidth: 10 },
  { source: 1, target: 3, bandwidth: 5 },
  { source: 2, target: 3, bandwidth: 12 },
  { source: 4, target: 5, bandwidth: 8 },
  { source: 5, target: 6, bandwidth: 3 },
  { source: 2, target: 5, bandwidth: 7}
];

const partitionSize = 3;
const minSecurityLevel = 5;

// Expected Output (one possible valid output):
// [
//   [ 4 ], // Node 4 is isolated due to security level
//   [ 1, 2, 3 ], // One possible partition
//   [ 5, 6 ]  // Another possible partition
// ]

// Another valid output, prioritizing bandwidth preservation:
// [
//   [ 4 ],
//   [ 5, 6, 2 ],
//   [ 1, 3 ]
// ]

```

Good luck! This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms, data structure knowledge, and optimization techniques.

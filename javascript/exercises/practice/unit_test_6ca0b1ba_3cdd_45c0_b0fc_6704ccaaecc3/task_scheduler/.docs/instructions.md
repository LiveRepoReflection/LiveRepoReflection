## The "Optimal Task Scheduler with Deadlines and Dependencies" Problem

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing an optimal task scheduler for a complex system.  The system needs to execute a set of `N` tasks. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id`: A unique integer identifier for the task (0 to N-1).
*   `duration`: An integer representing the time required to complete the task.
*   `deadline`: An integer representing the time by which the task must be completed.  If a task is not completed by its deadline, a penalty is incurred.
*   `penalty`: An integer representing the penalty incurred if the task is not completed by its deadline.
*   `dependencies`: An array of integer `id`s, representing the tasks that must be completed before this task can start.  If the required dependencies are not completed, the task cannot start.

The scheduler can execute only one task at a time.  The goal is to find a schedule (an ordered list of task `id`s) that minimizes the total penalty incurred due to tasks missing their deadlines.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Valid Schedule:** The schedule must respect all task dependencies. A task can only be scheduled after all its dependencies have been completed.
2.  **Non-Preemptive:** Once a task starts executing, it must run to completion without interruption.
3.  **Optimization Target:** Minimize the total penalty.  A task's penalty is only counted if the task completes *after* its deadline.
4.  **Time Complexity:** The expected solution should aim for an efficient time complexity.  Brute-force solutions (trying all possible permutations) are not acceptable due to the large number of tasks. Aim for a solution better than O(N!), where N is the number of tasks.
5.  **Memory Usage:** Memory usage should also be considered. Avoid unnecessary large data structures.
6.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Handle cases with circular dependencies (should throw an error).
    *   Handle cases where it is impossible to complete all tasks before their deadlines.
    *   Handle cases where there are no dependencies.
    *   Handle cases where some tasks have the same deadline.
7.  **Input:** The input will be a JSON array of task objects.  Each task object will have the structure:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "duration": 5,
            "deadline": 10,
            "penalty": 100,
            "dependencies": []
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "duration": 3,
            "deadline": 8,
            "penalty": 50,
            "dependencies": [0]
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "duration": 7,
            "deadline": 15,
            "penalty": 75,
            "dependencies": [0, 1]
        }
        // ... more tasks
    ]
    ```

8. **Output**: The output must be a JSON object containing two fields:

    *   `schedule`: an array of task IDs representing the optimal schedule.
    *   `totalPenalty`: the total penalty incurred by the schedule.

    For Example with the input above, a possible output is:

    ```json
    {
        "schedule": [0, 1, 2],
        "totalPenalty": 0
    }
    ```

**Grading Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution produce a valid schedule that respects dependencies?
*   Optimality: How close is the solution to the minimum possible penalty?  Test cases will include scenarios designed to challenge different optimization strategies.
*   Time Complexity: Is the solution efficient enough to handle a large number of tasks within a reasonable time limit?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
*   Error Handling: Does the solution correctly handle edge cases and invalid input?

**Hints:**

*   Consider topological sorting to handle dependencies.
*   Explore different scheduling algorithms such as Earliest Deadline First (EDF) or variations of it.
*   Dynamic programming or greedy approaches might be helpful.
*   Think about how to prioritize tasks to minimize the overall penalty.
*   Be mindful of the trade-offs between different optimization strategies. Some may perform better in certain scenarios than others.

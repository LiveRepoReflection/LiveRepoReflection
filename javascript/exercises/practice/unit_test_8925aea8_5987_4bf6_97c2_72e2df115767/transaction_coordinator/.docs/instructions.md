Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem designed to be difficult and incorporate several elements of sophistication:

## Problem: Distributed Transaction Coordinator

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified distributed transaction coordinator.  Imagine a system where multiple independent services (databases, message queues, etc.) need to participate in a single, atomic transaction. The goal is to ensure that either all services successfully commit their part of the transaction, or all services roll back, even in the face of network failures or service outages.

Your coordinator will receive transaction requests from clients. Each transaction will involve a series of *operations* that must be performed on various *resources* managed by different *participants*.

**Participants:** Represent independent services that can perform operations on resources. Each participant has a unique ID. Your system will interact with these participants through asynchronous message passing (simulated with Promises in JavaScript).

**Resources:**  Each resource is managed by a single participant.  A resource can be anything like a database row, a file, a message queue, etc. Resources are identified by a unique string ID within the participant's scope.

**Operations:**  Represent actions to be performed on a resource.  Each operation is defined by a participant ID, a resource ID, and an operation type (e.g., "write", "delete", "enqueue").  Operations are atomic within a single participant.

**Transactions:** A transaction consists of a series of operations.  The coordinator is responsible for orchestrating the operations across all participants to ensure atomicity (all or nothing).

**Your task is to implement the following functions:**

1.  **`registerParticipant(participantId, commitFunction, rollbackFunction)`:** Registers a new participant with the coordinator. `participantId` is a unique string. `commitFunction` and `rollbackFunction` are asynchronous functions (returning Promises) that the coordinator will call to commit or rollback operations for that participant.  These functions take an array of `resourceId` strings as input, representing the resources that the participant needs to commit or rollback.

2.  **`initiateTransaction(operations)`:** Initiates a new transaction. `operations` is an array of operation objects, each with the following structure:
    ```javascript
    {
        participantId: string,
        resourceId: string,
        operationType: string, // e.g., "write", "delete", "enqueue"
        data: any // Optional data for the operation
    }
    ```
    This function should return a Promise that resolves when the transaction is successfully committed or rejects if the transaction is rolled back.

3.  **`getTransactionState(transactionId)`:** Returns the current state of the transaction (e.g., "pending", "committed", "rolled_back"). `transactionId` is a unique string identifying the transaction.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **Atomicity:** All operations in a transaction must either succeed, or all must fail.
*   **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, the changes must be persistent. This is implicitly guaranteed by the successful resolution of the commit Promises.
*   **Isolation:**  While not explicitly enforced in this simplified model, consider how concurrent transactions might affect each other in a real-world scenario.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:**  The coordinator must handle asynchronous communication with participants using Promises.
*   **Error Handling:**  The coordinator must handle participant failures (e.g., `commitFunction` or `rollbackFunction` rejecting) and network errors (simulated by Promise rejections).  When a failure occurs, the coordinator should attempt to rollback all participants.
*   **Idempotency:** The `commitFunction` and `rollbackFunction` of each participant should be idempotent.  This means that calling them multiple times with the same `resourceIds` should have the same effect as calling them once. This is crucial to handle potential re-tries due to network issues.
*   **Optimization:**  The coordinator should attempt to perform operations in parallel where possible to minimize the overall transaction time. For example, the coordinator can prepare all participants concurrently.
*   **Scalability:**  While you don't need to implement distributed coordination in this single-process challenge, consider how your design could be extended to handle a large number of participants and transactions.
*   **Resource Locking:** The participant should implement a resource locking mechanism that prevents the same resource from being modified by multiple transactions at the same time. If a resource is already locked, the participant should reject the commit or rollback request.

**Edge Cases:**

*   Duplicate operations in the same transaction.
*   Operations on the same resource by different participants.
*   A participant failing to register before a transaction is initiated that requires it.
*   Network errors during commit or rollback.
*   Idempotency of commit/rollback functions.
*   Transactions involving a very large number of operations.
*   Transactions with no operations.
*   Transactions that take a very long time to complete.
*   Resources not existing in a participant.
*   Participants returning errors that aren't Promise rejections.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
// Example Participant
const dbParticipant = {
    commit: async (resourceIds) => {
        // Simulate database commit
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50)); // Simulate latency
        console.log(`DB committed resources: ${resourceIds.join(', ')}`);
        return true;
    },
    rollback: async (resourceIds) => {
        // Simulate database rollback
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50)); // Simulate latency
        console.log(`DB rolled back resources: ${resourceIds.join(', ')}`);
        return true;
    }
};

// Register the participant
transactionCoordinator.registerParticipant("db1", dbParticipant.commit, dbParticipant.rollback);

// Initiate a transaction
const operations = [
    { participantId: "db1", resourceId: "account1", operationType: "write", data: { balance: 100 } },
    { participantId: "db1", resourceId: "account2", operationType: "write", data: { balance: 200 } }
];

transactionCoordinator.initiateTransaction(operations)
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Transaction committed successfully!");
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Transaction rolled back:", error);
    });
```

This problem tests a wide range of skills, from understanding distributed systems concepts to implementing asynchronous JavaScript code with proper error handling and optimization. It also forces the developer to consider various edge cases and design choices that have real-world implications. Good luck!

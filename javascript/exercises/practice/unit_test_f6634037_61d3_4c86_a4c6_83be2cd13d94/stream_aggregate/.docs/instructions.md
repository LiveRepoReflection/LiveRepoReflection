Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem designed to be on par with LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world considerations:

## Problem: Scalable Event Stream Aggregation

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing and implementing a system for real-time aggregation of event data from a high-volume stream.  Imagine a massive IoT network where devices are constantly sending sensor readings (temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.).  Your system must efficiently aggregate these readings based on various criteria and time windows.

Specifically, you need to implement a `StreamAggregator` class with the following functionality:

1.  **Ingest Events:**  The `ingest(deviceId, timestamp, metric, value)` method receives individual event records.

    *   `deviceId`: A unique string identifier for the device generating the event.
    *   `timestamp`: A Unix timestamp (in seconds) representing the time the event occurred.
    *   `metric`: A string representing the type of measurement (e.g., "temperature", "pressure").
    *   `value`: A numerical value representing the measurement.

2.  **Aggregate Queries:** The `query(deviceId, metric, aggregationType, timeWindow)` method retrieves aggregated results.

    *   `deviceId`: The device ID to filter by.  Use "*" to indicate all devices.
    *   `metric`: The metric to aggregate. Use "*" to indicate all metrics.
    *   `aggregationType`: A string specifying the aggregation function to apply. Supported types are:
        *   `"count"`: The number of events within the time window.
        *   `"sum"`: The sum of values within the time window.
        *   `"avg"`: The average of values within the time window.
        *   `"min"`: The minimum value within the time window.
        *   `"max"`: The maximum value within the time window.
    *   `timeWindow`: An object with `start` and `end` properties, both Unix timestamps (in seconds), defining the time range for the aggregation. The range is inclusive of the start and end times.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

*   **High Throughput:** The `ingest` method must be highly performant, capable of handling thousands of events per second.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a large number of devices and metrics.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** Memory usage must be optimized to avoid excessive consumption, especially with long time windows.  Consider how you store the data.
*   **Time Complexity:** The `query` method should be as efficient as possible. Aim for a time complexity that scales well with the size of the time window and the number of matching events.
*   **Real-time:** Queries should return results quickly, reflecting the most recent ingested data.
*   **Accuracy:**  Aggregation results must be accurate, even with concurrent ingestions and queries.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases gracefully, such as:
    *   Empty time windows (start === end).
    *   Invalid `deviceId` or `metric` (return 0 if no data matches the query).
    *   No events within the time window (return 0 for sum, avg, min, max and 0 for count).
    *   `aggregationType` is not supported (throw an error).

**Example:**

```javascript
const aggregator = new StreamAggregator();

aggregator.ingest("device1", 1678886400, "temperature", 25);  // March 15, 2023 00:00:00
aggregator.ingest("device1", 1678886460, "temperature", 26);  // March 15, 2023 00:01:00
aggregator.ingest("device2", 1678886520, "temperature", 27);  // March 15, 2023 00:02:00
aggregator.ingest("device1", 1678886580, "pressure", 1010);   // March 15, 2023 00:03:00

const timeWindow = { start: 1678886400, end: 1678886520 };

console.log(aggregator.query("device1", "temperature", "avg", timeWindow));   // Output: 25.5
console.log(aggregator.query("*", "temperature", "sum", timeWindow));      // Output: 52
console.log(aggregator.query("device2", "*", "count", timeWindow));        // Output: 1
```

**Considerations:**

*   Think about how you'll structure your data to efficiently store and retrieve events. Consider using multiple data structures to optimize for different query patterns.
*   Explore techniques for optimizing memory usage, such as data summarization or sampling.
*   Consider using appropriate algorithms for calculating aggregations efficiently.
*   Think about how to handle potential concurrency issues if multiple ingestions and queries occur simultaneously.

Good luck! This is designed to be a challenging, open-ended problem that requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithms, and system design principles.

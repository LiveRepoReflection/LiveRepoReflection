Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem designed to be on par with a LeetCode Hard difficulty question.

**Problem Title: Efficient Route Planner with Real-Time Traffic**

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with developing an efficient route planner for a delivery service operating in a large city. The city's road network is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent road segments. Each road segment has a base travel time (in minutes) and a real-time traffic factor that can increase the travel time.

Your route planner needs to handle the following:

1.  **Graph Representation:** You are provided with two arrays: `edges` and `trafficData`. The `edges` array represents the road network and is in the format `[[startNode, endNode, baseTravelTime], ...]`. `trafficData` is an array that contains real-time traffic information.

2.  **Real-Time Traffic:** The `trafficData` array is dynamically updated and contains information on the current traffic congestion for each road segment. Each entry in the `trafficData` array is in the format `[[startNode, endNode, trafficFactor], ...]`. The `trafficFactor` is a multiplier that should be applied to the `baseTravelTime` of the corresponding edge.  A `trafficFactor` of 1 indicates no traffic, while values greater than 1 indicate increased travel time.  Assume `trafficFactor` >= 1.

3.  **Dynamic Updates:** The `trafficData` array can be updated frequently. Your route planner needs to efficiently recalculate routes based on these updates.

4.  **Multiple Delivery Points:** The delivery service needs to visit multiple locations in a specific order. You are given an array `deliveryPoints` representing the sequence of locations to visit. The first element in `deliveryPoints` is the starting location, and the last element is the final destination.

5.  **Optimization Goal:** Your task is to find the *fastest* route (minimum total travel time) that visits all the locations in `deliveryPoints` in the specified order, considering the real-time traffic conditions.

6.  **Time Constraints:** The route planner must be able to calculate the optimal route within a strict time limit (e.g., a few seconds) even for large city graphs with many delivery points.

7.  **Error Handling:** If a route between two consecutive delivery points is impossible (e.g., no path exists), the function should return `-1`.

**Input:**

*   `edges`: A 2D array representing the road network. Each element is `[startNode, endNode, baseTravelTime]`.
*   `trafficData`: A 2D array representing real-time traffic factors. Each element is `[startNode, endNode, trafficFactor]`.
*   `deliveryPoints`: An array representing the sequence of locations to visit.

**Output:**

*   The minimum total travel time (in minutes) to visit all delivery points in the specified order, considering real-time traffic. Return `-1` if a route is impossible.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph can be large (e.g., up to 1000).
*   The number of edges in the graph can be large (e.g., up to 5000).
*   The number of delivery points can be up to 10.
*   The `baseTravelTime` for each edge is a positive integer.
*   The `trafficFactor` for each edge is a floating-point number >= 1.
*   The graph may not be fully connected.
*   Consider possible floating point precision errors.

**Example:**

```javascript
edges = [[0, 1, 10], [0, 2, 15], [1, 2, 5], [2, 3, 20], [1, 3, 12]];
trafficData = [[0, 1, 1.5], [1, 2, 2.0], [2, 3, 1.2]];
deliveryPoints = [0, 1, 2, 3];

// Expected Output:  (10 * 1.5) + (5 * 2.0) + (20 * 1.2) = 15 + 10 + 24 = 49
```

**Challenge:**

This problem requires a combination of graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search), efficient data structures for graph representation, and careful optimization to meet the time constraints.  Handling the dynamic `trafficData` efficiently is also crucial. Consider different pre-processing strategies and how to update the graph representation based on traffic changes without recomputing everything from scratch.  Think about the trade-offs between memory usage and computation time.

Okay, here's a challenging and sophisticated JavaScript coding problem, designed to be similar to LeetCode Hard difficulty, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world scenarios.

**Problem Title:** Distributed Task Scheduler with Deadlock Detection

**Problem Description:**

You are tasked with designing a distributed task scheduler.  Multiple worker nodes are available to execute tasks. Tasks have dependencies on each other.  The scheduler must ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order, respecting dependencies, and it must efficiently utilize the worker nodes. Furthermore, it must detect and resolve deadlocks.

**Detailed Requirements:**

1.  **Task Representation:** Each task is represented by a unique ID (string), a processing time (integer, representing the number of time units required to execute the task), and a list of task IDs that must be completed *before* this task can begin (dependencies).

2.  **Worker Nodes:** You have a pool of `N` worker nodes. Each worker can execute only one task at a time.

3.  **Scheduling Logic:**
    *   The scheduler must assign tasks to available workers as soon as their dependencies are met.
    *   A task can only be assigned to a worker if all its dependencies have been completed.
    *   The goal is to minimize the overall time to complete all tasks (makespan).
    *   Assume that task assignment is instantaneous.

4.  **Deadlock Detection and Resolution:**
    *   The scheduler must be able to detect deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when a set of tasks are mutually dependent on each other, preventing any of them from starting.
    *   If a deadlock is detected, the scheduler must resolve it by forcibly removing the *least valuable* task from the dependency graph, allowing the remaining tasks to proceed.  The "value" of a task is calculated as its processing time. If multiple tasks have the same minimum processing time, remove the one with the alphabetically smallest ID.
    *   Removal of a task means that it is never executed. Other tasks that depend on the removed task can now proceed.

5. **Concurrency and Asynchronicity:** Your solution must be able to handle concurrent task submissions and worker availability updates. Use appropriate asynchronous techniques (e.g., Promises, async/await) to ensure non-blocking operation.

6.  **Scalability:**  The system should be designed to handle a large number of tasks (up to 10,000) and a reasonable number of worker nodes (up to 100). Aim for an efficient solution.

7.  **Interface:** Implement the following functions:

    *   `addTask(taskId, processingTime, dependencies)`: Adds a new task to the scheduler.  `dependencies` is an array of task IDs.
    *   `workerAvailable()`: Notifies the scheduler that a worker node is available. The scheduler should then attempt to assign a task to the worker.
    *   `getCurrentState()`: Returns a snapshot of the current state of the scheduler. This should include:
        *   A list of tasks that are currently running on each worker node.
        *   A list of tasks that are waiting to be executed (and the reasons why they are waiting - i.e., which dependencies are not yet met).
        *   A list of completed tasks.
        *   A list of removed tasks (due to deadlock resolution).
    *   `simulateTick()`: Advances the scheduler by one time unit.  Running tasks have their processing time decremented.  Completed tasks are removed from the worker nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   Processing time for each task is between 1 and 100.
*   The number of dependencies for each task can be between 0 and 10.
*   Task IDs are unique strings.
*   The scheduler must be implemented in JavaScript (Node.js environment is preferred for async/await support).
*   Optimize for makespan (total time to complete all tasks).
*   Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., invalid task IDs in dependencies, duplicate task submissions).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the scheduler correctly execute tasks, respecting dependencies and resolving deadlocks?
*   Efficiency: How quickly does the scheduler complete a given set of tasks?
*   Scalability: Can the scheduler handle a large number of tasks and worker nodes?
*   Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?  Are appropriate data structures used?
*   Deadlock Resolution Strategy: Is the deadlock resolution strategy effective in minimizing the impact on overall task completion time?

This problem requires a deep understanding of task scheduling algorithms, dependency management, deadlock detection/resolution, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript. It also challenges the solver to consider performance optimization and scalability. Good luck!

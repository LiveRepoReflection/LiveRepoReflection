Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem designed to be at LeetCode Hard level, incorporating advanced data structures, optimization requirements, and real-world relevance.

**Problem:** Efficient Network Packet Routing

**Question Description:**

You are given a network represented as a directed graph. Each node in the graph represents a router, and each directed edge represents a network connection with a specific bandwidth capacity.  Each router also has a limited processing capacity.

Your task is to design an efficient packet routing system that can handle a large volume of data transmission requests. You are given a list of data transmission requests, where each request specifies a source router, a destination router, and the amount of data to be transmitted (in megabytes).

Your system must determine the optimal path for each data transmission request, considering both the bandwidth capacity of the network connections and the processing capacity of the routers. The goal is to maximize the number of requests that can be successfully routed through the network while minimizing the average latency for each request.

**Constraints and Requirements:**

1.  **Network Representation:** The network is represented as an adjacency list, where each key is a router ID (integer), and the value is a list of its outgoing connections. Each connection is an object containing the destination router ID and the bandwidth capacity (in megabytes per second).
    ```javascript
    {
        1: [{ destination: 2, bandwidth: 10 }, { destination: 3, bandwidth: 5 }],
        2: [{ destination: 4, bandwidth: 8 }],
        3: [{ destination: 4, bandwidth: 12 }]
    }
    ```

2.  **Router Capacity:** Each router has a processing capacity (in megabytes per second). This limits the total data it can forward at any given time.  Router capacities are provided in a separate object.
    ```javascript
    {
        1: 20,
        2: 15,
        3: 25,
        4: 30
    }
    ```

3.  **Data Transmission Requests:** The data transmission requests are provided as an array of objects. Each object contains the source router ID, the destination router ID, and the data size (in megabytes).
    ```javascript
    [
        { source: 1, destination: 4, dataSize: 50 },
        { source: 2, destination: 4, dataSize: 30 },
        { source: 1, destination: 2, dataSize: 20 }
    ]
    ```

4.  **Optimization:** You must prioritize successfully routing as many requests as possible. If multiple routing options exist, prioritize paths with lower latency (shorter paths with higher bandwidth). You must also respect the processing capacity of each router.

5.  **Concurrency:** Your solution should be designed to handle multiple requests concurrently (simulated). Consider how you would manage resource allocation and prevent conflicts between concurrent requests.

6.  **Scalability:** The network can contain a large number of routers and connections (e.g., thousands of nodes). Your solution should be efficient enough to handle large networks within a reasonable time frame (e.g., a few seconds).

7.  **Error Handling:** If a request cannot be routed due to insufficient bandwidth, router capacity, or no available path, it should be marked as failed.

8.  **Output:** The function should return an array of objects, where each object represents the status of a data transmission request.  Each object should contain the original request details, a `success` flag (boolean), and a `latency` value (in seconds) if the request was successfully routed, or `null` if the request failed.
    ```javascript
    [
        { source: 1, destination: 4, dataSize: 50, success: true, latency: 5.2 },
        { source: 2, destination: 4, dataSize: 30, success: false, latency: null },
        { source: 1, destination: 2, dataSize: 20, success: true, latency: 2.1 }
    ]
    ```

**Example:**

```javascript
const network = {
    1: [{ destination: 2, bandwidth: 10 }, { destination: 3, bandwidth: 5 }],
    2: [{ destination: 4, bandwidth: 8 }],
    3: [{ destination: 4, bandwidth: 12 }]
};

const routerCapacities = {
    1: 20,
    2: 15,
    3: 25,
    4: 30
};

const requests = [
    { source: 1, destination: 4, dataSize: 50 },
    { source: 2, destination: 4, dataSize: 30 },
    { source: 1, destination: 2, dataSize: 20 }
];

const results = routePackets(network, routerCapacities, requests);
console.log(results);
```

**Hints:**

*   Consider using Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* search to find the shortest paths.
*   Use a priority queue or heap to manage the requests based on priority (e.g., shortest path first).
*   Implement a resource allocation mechanism to track available bandwidth and router capacity.
*   Think about how to handle concurrent requests and prevent over-allocation of resources.
*   Consider using a flow network approach (e.g., Ford-Fulkerson algorithm) if you need to guarantee optimal routing of all requests. However, this might be computationally more expensive.  A greedy approach, combined with careful resource management, might be sufficient for many cases.

**This problem requires a good understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and system design principles. The optimization and concurrency requirements make it particularly challenging.**

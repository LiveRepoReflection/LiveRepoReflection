Okay, here's a challenging Javascript coding problem designed to be difficult and sophisticated.

**Project Name:** `ScalableAnalyticsPlatform`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with designing a simplified, in-memory analytics platform capable of processing a high volume of real-time events and calculating aggregate statistics (sum, average, min, max) over configurable time windows.  The platform needs to be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent event streams.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Event Ingestion:** The platform must efficiently ingest events. Each event will be a simple JSON object with a `timestamp` (in milliseconds since epoch) and a `value` (a numerical value). Assume events arrive in chronological order *within a single stream*, but the arrival order *across different streams* is not guaranteed.

2.  **Stream Management:** The platform must support multiple independent event streams, each identified by a unique `streamId` (a string).

3.  **Time Windows:** The platform must allow users to define sliding time windows for each stream. A time window is defined by its duration in milliseconds.  Multiple time windows can be configured for the same stream.

4.  **Aggregate Calculations:** For each stream and each configured time window, the platform must continuously calculate and maintain the following aggregate statistics:
    *   `sum`: The sum of all `value`s within the window.
    *   `average`: The average of all `value`s within the window.
    *   `min`: The minimum `value` within the window.
    *   `max`: The maximum `value` within the window.

5.  **Querying:**  Users must be able to query the platform for the current aggregate statistics for a given `streamId` and time window duration. The query should return an object containing the `sum`, `average`, `min`, and `max` for that window.

6.  **Concurrency:** The platform must be thread-safe and handle concurrent event ingestion and queries efficiently.

7.  **Memory Management:**  The platform should avoid unbounded memory growth.  Events outside the configured time windows should be automatically discarded.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Real-time Performance:** The platform must provide low-latency ingestion and query performance, even under high load. This is crucial.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** The platform's memory usage should be proportional to the active time windows and event rates, not the total number of events ever ingested.
*   **Data Structure Choice:**  Selecting appropriate data structures for storing events and calculating aggregates is critical for performance. Consider the trade-offs between different data structures.
*   **Time Complexity:** Aim for solutions with optimal time complexity for both ingestion and querying.  Avoid naive O(n) approaches where possible.
*   **No External Libraries:** You are restricted to using standard Javascript built-in objects and data structures.  No external libraries (e.g., Lodash, Moment.js) are allowed.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values, invalid stream IDs).
*   **Garbage Collection:** Be mindful of garbage collection. Excessive object creation and destruction can impact performance.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
const analytics = new ScalableAnalyticsPlatform();

analytics.createStream("stream1");
analytics.addTimeWindow("stream1", 60000); // 1 minute window
analytics.addTimeWindow("stream1", 300000); // 5 minute window

analytics.ingestEvent("stream1", { timestamp: Date.now(), value: 10 });
analytics.ingestEvent("stream1", { timestamp: Date.now() + 1000, value: 20 });
analytics.ingestEvent("stream1", { timestamp: Date.now() + 2000, value: 5 });

const stats = analytics.query("stream1", 60000);
console.log(stats); // Expected output (approximately): { sum: 35, average: 11.67, min: 5, max: 20 }
```

**Judging Criteria:**

Solutions will be judged on:

*   **Correctness:** Accurate calculation of aggregate statistics.
*   **Performance:** Ingestion and query latency under load.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** Memory footprint of the platform.
*   **Code Quality:** Code readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
*   **Concurrency Handling:**  Correctness and efficiency of concurrent operations.

This problem requires a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and concurrency concepts in Javascript.  Good luck!

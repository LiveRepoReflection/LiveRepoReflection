## Question Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter.

**Context:**

Imagine you are building a highly scalable web service. To protect your service from abuse, denial-of-service attacks, and to ensure fair usage, you need to implement rate limiting. However, your service is distributed across multiple servers, making a simple in-memory rate limiter inadequate. You need a solution that works across your entire distributed system.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Functionality:**

    *   Implement a `rateLimit(userId, action, limit, timeWindow)` function that determines whether a given user (identified by `userId`) is allowed to perform a specific `action`.
    *   The `limit` parameter specifies the maximum number of times the `action` can be performed within the given `timeWindow` (in seconds).
    *   The function should return a boolean value: `true` if the action is allowed (within the rate limit), `false` otherwise.

2.  **Distribution:**

    *   The rate limiter must work correctly across multiple servers.  Assume you have access to a distributed key-value store (e.g., Redis, Memcached) that can be used for coordination. The key-value store guarantees atomicity for read and write operations on single keys.
    *   Your solution should handle race conditions that can occur when multiple servers concurrently try to increment the usage count for a user.

3.  **Efficiency:**

    *   Minimize the number of calls to the distributed key-value store to reduce latency and overhead.
    *   Optimize for both time and space complexity. Consider the scalability of your solution as the number of users and actions grows.

4.  **Edge Cases and Constraints:**

    *   Handle cases where the `userId` or `action` are empty or invalid.
    *   The `timeWindow` should be configurable and support a reasonable range of values (e.g., 1 second to 1 hour).
    *   Consider the potential for clock skew across different servers in your distributed system. How would you mitigate its impact?
    *   Think about how to handle the expiration of rate limit data in the key-value store to avoid unbounded storage growth.
    *   Assume the number of unique user IDs and actions can be very large, potentially exceeding the memory capacity of a single server.

5.  **Multiple Valid Approaches:**

    *   Explore different algorithms and data structures that can be used to implement the rate limiter.
    *   Analyze the trade-offs between different approaches in terms of accuracy, performance, and complexity. For example, consider using sliding window algorithms or token bucket algorithms.
    *   Document your design choices and the reasoning behind them.

6.  **System Design Aspects:**

    *   Discuss how your rate limiter could be integrated into a larger system architecture.
    *   Consider the monitoring and observability aspects of your solution. How would you track the effectiveness of the rate limiter and identify potential issues?
    *   Outline a strategy for testing your distributed rate limiter to ensure its correctness and performance under various load conditions.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Assume you have a distributed key-value store client: kvStore
// kvStore.get(key): Retrieves the value associated with the key. Returns null if the key does not exist.
// kvStore.set(key, value, expirationTime): Sets the value for the key with an expiration time in seconds.

function rateLimit(userId, action, limit, timeWindow) {
  // Implementation details here
}

// Example Usage:
// rateLimit("user123", "login", 5, 60); // Allow user123 to login a maximum of 5 times in 60 seconds.
```

**Judging Criteria:**

*   Correctness: Does the solution accurately enforce the rate limits?
*   Efficiency: How well does the solution perform in terms of latency and resource usage?
*   Scalability: Can the solution handle a large number of users and actions?
*   Robustness: Does the solution handle edge cases and potential errors gracefully?
*   Clarity: Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?
*   Design: Is the chosen approach appropriate for a distributed environment? Are the design choices well-justified?
*   Completeness: Does the solution address all the requirements and constraints outlined in the problem description?

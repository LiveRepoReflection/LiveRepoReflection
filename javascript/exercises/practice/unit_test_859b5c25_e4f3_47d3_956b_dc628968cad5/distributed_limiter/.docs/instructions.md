Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem designed to test advanced concepts, optimization, and edge-case handling.

### Project Name

distributed-rate-limiter
```

### Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter. This rate limiter will be used to protect a critical API endpoint from abuse, ensuring that no single user or client can overwhelm the system.

**Scenario:** Imagine a large-scale social media platform where users can post messages. You need to prevent users from spamming the platform by posting too frequently. Your rate limiter must handle a massive number of requests per second, distributed across multiple servers.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must function correctly across a cluster of independent servers. No single server should be a point of failure.
2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limit should be configurable per user (or client identifier). The configuration should allow setting the maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time window (e.g., 10 requests per minute).
3.  **Near Real-time Accuracy:** While absolute precision isn't required, the rate limiter should provide near real-time accuracy. Occasional minor discrepancies are acceptable, but significant deviations from the configured rate limit are not.
4.  **Low Latency:** The rate limiter should introduce minimal latency to the API request processing. Every millisecond counts.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The rate limiter should gracefully handle failures of individual servers or components. If a server goes down, the overall rate limiting functionality should continue to operate.
6.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing traffic volume. Adding more servers to the cluster should increase the overall capacity of the rate limiter.
7.  **Atomic Operations:** Ensure that all operations involved in checking and updating the request counts are atomic to prevent race conditions in a concurrent environment.
8.  **Efficient Data Structures:** Use efficient data structures to store and manage the request counts. Consider trade-offs between memory usage and performance.
9.  **Eviction Policy:** Implement an eviction policy to automatically remove inactive users from the rate limiter's data store. This prevents the data store from growing indefinitely.
10. **Client Identifier:** The rate limiter should accept a client identifier (e.g., user ID, API key) as input for each request. This identifier is used to track the request counts for individual clients.

**Input:**

*   `clientId`: A string representing the client identifier (e.g., "user123", "api-key-xyz").
*   `rateLimitConfig`: An object containing the rate limit configuration for a specific client.
    *   `limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed within the time window.
    *   `windowMs`: The duration of the time window in milliseconds.

**Output:**

*   A boolean value indicating whether the request should be allowed (`true`) or rate-limited (`false`).

**Constraints:**

*   You should implement the core rate limiting logic in JavaScript. You are free to use any data structures or libraries available in the JavaScript ecosystem.
*   You are strongly encouraged to leverage a distributed caching system like Redis or Memcached to achieve the distributed operation and fault tolerance requirements. You can use an in-memory solution, but the problem setter will manually evaluate the scalabilty and design of the solution to meet the spirit of the question.
*   Consider using appropriate data structures for storing request counts and timestamps efficiently (e.g., sorted sets, hash maps).
*   Pay close attention to potential race conditions and ensure that your implementation is thread-safe.
*   Optimize for performance, especially in the check and update operations. Aim for low latency and high throughput.

**Example:**

```javascript
const rateLimiter = new DistributedRateLimiter();

// Configure rate limit for user "user123": 10 requests per minute
rateLimiter.configureRateLimit("user123", { limit: 10, windowMs: 60000 });

// Simulate multiple requests from user "user123"
for (let i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
  const allowed = rateLimiter.isAllowed("user123");
  console.log(`Request ${i + 1} from user123: ${allowed}`);
}
```

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement dynamic rate limit adjustment based on system load or other metrics.
*   Provide real-time monitoring and metrics for the rate limiter, such as request counts, error rates, and latency.
*   Implement a "leaky bucket" algorithm for smoother rate limiting.

This question is designed to be open-ended and allows for various approaches. The goal is to evaluate the candidate's ability to design a scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performance distributed system. Good luck!

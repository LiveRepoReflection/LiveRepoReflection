## Question: Distributed Rate Limiter with Weighted Fair Queuing

### Description

Design and implement a distributed rate limiter that adheres to Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) principles. This rate limiter needs to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, suitable for managing traffic across a large microservices architecture.

**Scenario:** Imagine a system where multiple services (e.g., A, B, C) are making requests to a shared resource (e.g., a database, an external API). Each service has a different priority or Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with it, dictating the rate at which it should be allowed to access the shared resource.  You need to ensure that each service gets its fair share of the resource based on its assigned weight, even when the total request rate exceeds the resource's capacity.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Operation:** The rate limiter must operate across multiple nodes/instances to handle high request volumes.

2.  **Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ):** Implement WFQ to ensure fair allocation of the shared resource based on service weights. Services with higher weights should receive proportionally more access.

3.  **Dynamic Weights:** The weights associated with each service should be dynamically adjustable at runtime without causing significant disruption to the system.

4.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system should be resilient to node failures. If a rate limiter instance goes down, the overall system should continue to operate correctly, ensuring that requests are still rate-limited according to the configured weights.

5.  **Low Latency:** The rate limiter should introduce minimal latency to the request processing pipeline. Every millisecond counts.

6.  **Accuracy:** The rate limiter should accurately enforce the configured rates, even under high load and with dynamic weight adjustments.

7.  **Centralized Configuration & Monitoring:** Provide a way to centrally configure and monitor the rate limiter's behavior, including service weights, request rates, and error conditions.

8.  **Concurrency Safety:** Ensure the implementation is thread-safe and can handle concurrent requests from multiple services.

**Input:**

*   A stream of requests arriving at the rate limiter. Each request is associated with a service identifier (e.g., "serviceA", "serviceB", "serviceC").
*   A configuration service that provides the current weights for each service. These weights can change over time.

**Output:**

*   A decision for each request: either "allow" or "deny". Requests that are allowed should be forwarded to the shared resource. Requests that are denied should be rejected with an appropriate error code.

**Constraints & Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of services (e.g., thousands) and a high request rate (e.g., millions of requests per second).
*   **Consistency:** The rate limiter instances should maintain a consistent view of the service weights, even with dynamic updates and potential network delays.
*   **Resource Limits:** You are operating in a resource-constrained environment. Minimize memory usage and CPU consumption.
*   **Time Complexity:** The algorithm's time complexity should be as efficient as possible, particularly for the request admission control decision.
*   **Real-world challenges**: Consider real-world network conditions, such as packet loss and variable latency.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   Implement adaptive weight adjustments based on the observed performance of the shared resource. If the resource becomes overloaded, automatically reduce the weights of the services with the highest request rates.
*   Provide a mechanism for prioritizing certain types of requests (e.g., critical operations) within a service.
*   Implement advanced monitoring and alerting capabilities to detect anomalies in the rate limiter's behavior.

Good luck! This is a challenging problem that requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, and algorithmic optimization.

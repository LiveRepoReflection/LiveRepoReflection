Okay, here's a challenging JavaScript coding problem designed to test a candidate's understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

**Problem:** Network Partitioning for Latency Minimization

**Question Description:**

You are given a network represented as an undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents a server, and each edge represents a network connection between two servers. Each edge has a latency value associated with it, representing the time it takes for data to travel between the connected servers.

Your task is to partition the network into `k` disjoint clusters (subsets of servers). The goal is to minimize the maximum latency between any two servers *within the same cluster*. More formally:

1.  Let `clusters` be an array of `k` sets, where each set contains the IDs of the servers belonging to that cluster.
2.  For each cluster `c` in `clusters`, calculate the maximum latency between any two servers `u` and `v` belonging to `c`. If `u` and `v` are not directly connected, consider the latency to be infinity (or a very large number).
3.  Your objective is to minimize the *maximum* of these maximum latencies across all clusters.  In other words, minimize `max(max_latency(c1), max_latency(c2), ..., max_latency(ck))`.

**Input:**

*   `n`: The number of servers in the network (numbered from 0 to n-1).
*   `edges`: A 2D array representing the network connections. Each element `edges[i]` is an array of three integers `[u, v, latency]`, indicating a connection between server `u` and server `v` with a latency of `latency`. The graph is undirected, so `[u, v, latency]` is equivalent to `[v, u, latency]`.
*   `k`: The number of clusters to partition the network into.

**Output:**

*   The minimum possible value of the maximum latency between any two servers within the same cluster after partitioning the network into `k` clusters.  Return `-1` if a valid partition is impossible.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
*   `0 <= u, v < n`
*   `1 <= latency <= 10000`
*   `1 <= k <= n`
*   The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
*   All edge connections are unique

**Example:**

```javascript
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 10], [0, 2, 15], [1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 20], [2, 4, 10]]
k = 2

// Possible optimal partition:
// Cluster 1: {0, 1, 2} (max latency = 15)
// Cluster 2: {3, 4} (max latency = Infinity because there is no direct edge between 3 and 4)

// Optimal result: 15
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Efficiency:** The solution should be efficient, especially for larger values of `n`.  Brute-force approaches will likely time out. Consider algorithmic complexity.
*   **Data Structures:** Choosing appropriate data structures (e.g., adjacency lists/matrices, priority queues/heaps) will significantly impact performance.
*   **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases carefully (e.g., when a cluster has only one node, when no edges are present, when `k == n`).
*   **Optimization:** Think about how to optimize the search for the optimal latency.  Binary search, combined with a check function, can be a very effective strategy.
*   **Connectivity:** Ensure each cluster has connectivity.

Good luck! This problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking and careful implementation.

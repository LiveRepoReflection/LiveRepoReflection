Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging JavaScript coding problem. Here it is:

## Problem: Distributed Task Scheduler with Resource Constraints

### Question Description

You are tasked with building a distributed task scheduler. The scheduler needs to efficiently assign tasks to available worker nodes in a cluster, considering resource constraints and task dependencies. The goal is to minimize the overall completion time (makespan) of a set of tasks.

**System Overview:**

*   **Tasks:** Each task has a unique ID, a list of dependencies (other task IDs that must be completed before this task can start), and resource requirements (CPU cores, memory in GB, and disk space in GB).
*   **Worker Nodes:** Each worker node has a unique ID and available resources (CPU cores, memory in GB, and disk space in GB).
*   **Scheduler:** Your scheduler will receive a list of tasks and a list of worker nodes. It must assign each task to a worker node such that:
    *   All dependencies of a task are completed before the task starts execution.
    *   The resource requirements of the task do not exceed the available resources of the assigned worker node.
    *   A worker node can only run one task at a time. A task occupies the resources of a worker node for the duration of its execution.
*   **Task Execution Time:** Each task has an estimated execution time (in seconds). This is known in advance.
*   **Data Transfer:** Assume there are no data transfer costs between worker nodes. Once a dependency is complete, the dependent task can immediately start on any available worker node that meets the resource requirements.

**Input:**

The input will be provided as two JavaScript arrays: `tasks` and `workers`.

*   `tasks`: An array of task objects. Each task object has the following properties:

    *   `id`: A unique string representing the task ID (e.g., "task1").
    *   `dependencies`: An array of strings representing the IDs of tasks that must be completed before this task can start (e.g., `["task2", "task3"]`).  Can be an empty array `[]` if the task has no dependencies.
    *   `cpu`: An integer representing the number of CPU cores required.
    *   `memory`: An integer representing the memory required in GB.
    *   `disk`: An integer representing the disk space required in GB.
    *   `time`: An integer representing the estimated execution time in seconds.
*   `workers`: An array of worker node objects. Each worker node object has the following properties:

    *   `id`: A unique string representing the worker node ID (e.g., "worker1").
    *   `cpu`: An integer representing the number of CPU cores available.
    *   `memory`: An integer representing the memory available in GB.
    *   `disk`: An integer representing the disk space available in GB.

**Output:**

Your function should return a JavaScript object representing the schedule. This object should have the following structure:

```javascript
{
  makespan: <number>, // The overall completion time of all tasks in seconds.
  schedule: {
    <task_id>: <worker_id>, // Assignment of each task to a worker node.
    ...
  }
}
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of tasks can be up to 1000.
*   The number of worker nodes can be up to 100.
*   Task execution times can range from 1 to 3600 seconds.
*   Resource requirements (CPU, memory, disk) and availability can range from 1 to 64.
*   The dependency graph is guaranteed to be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). No circular dependencies will exist.
*   All task and worker IDs are unique strings.

**Optimization Requirements:**

*   Your scheduler should aim to minimize the `makespan` (overall completion time).  Suboptimal schedules will still be accepted, but higher scores will be awarded to schedules with shorter makespans.
*   The scheduler should be efficient.  Solutions that take excessively long to execute will be terminated. Aim for a solution that can handle the maximum constraints within a reasonable time (e.g., < 30 seconds).

**Example:**

```javascript
const tasks = [
  { id: "task1", dependencies: [], cpu: 2, memory: 4, disk: 10, time: 60 },
  { id: "task2", dependencies: [], cpu: 1, memory: 2, disk: 5, time: 120 },
  { id: "task3", dependencies: ["task1", "task2"], cpu: 4, memory: 8, disk: 20, time: 180 },
];

const workers = [
  { id: "worker1", cpu: 8, memory: 16, disk: 100 },
  { id: "worker2", cpu: 4, memory: 8, disk: 50 },
];

// A possible, though not necessarily optimal, output:
// {
//   makespan: 360,
//   schedule: {
//     task1: "worker1",
//     task2: "worker2",
//     task3: "worker1"
//   }
// }

```

**Grading:**

*   Correctness: The solution must produce a valid schedule that satisfies all constraints.
*   Makespan: Solutions with shorter makespans will receive higher scores.
*   Efficiency: Solutions that execute quickly will receive higher scores.

**Hints:**

*   Consider using topological sorting to handle task dependencies.
*   Explore different scheduling algorithms, such as greedy algorithms, list scheduling, or more advanced optimization techniques.
*   Think about how to efficiently track available resources on each worker node.
*   Remember to handle edge cases and potential errors gracefully.

This problem requires a good understanding of algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Good luck!

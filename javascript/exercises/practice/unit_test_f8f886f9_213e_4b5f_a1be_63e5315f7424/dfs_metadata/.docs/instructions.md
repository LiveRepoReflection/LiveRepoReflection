Okay, I'm ready to create a challenging JavaScript coding problem. Here it is:

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simplified metadata management system for a distributed file system (DFS).  Imagine a system like Google File System (GFS) or Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), but significantly scaled down.

Your system needs to efficiently handle the following operations:

1.  **`createFile(path, replicationFactor)`:** Creates a new file entry in the metadata. The `path` is a string representing the full path of the file (e.g., "/home/user/document.txt"). The `replicationFactor` is an integer indicating how many copies of the file's data should be maintained across the cluster. The root directory `/` always exists. Assume that all parent directories must exist before a file can be created.

2.  **`createDirectory(path)`:** Creates a new directory entry in the metadata.  The `path` is a string representing the full path of the directory (e.g., "/home/user/documents"). The root directory `/` always exists. Assume that all parent directories must exist before a directory can be created.

3.  **`delete(path)`:** Deletes a file or directory entry from the metadata. If it's a directory, it must be empty before being deleted.  Attempting to delete a non-empty directory should result in an error.

4.  **`getFileMetadata(path)`:** Retrieves metadata about a file.  This metadata should include:
    *   `replicationFactor`: The number of data copies.
    *   `size`: The file size in bytes. Initially, a new file has a size of 0.

5.  **`listFiles(path)`:** Lists all files and directories immediately under a given directory `path`.  The result should be a list of strings, where each string is the name of a file or directory (not the full path). The order of the list does not matter.

6.  **`increaseFileSize(path, increment)`:** Increases the size of the file `path` by `increment` bytes.

7. **`findFilesWithReplicationFactor(replicationFactor)`:** Find all file paths with the specified `replicationFactor`.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Path Format:** Paths are absolute and start with a forward slash ("/"). Components of the path are separated by forward slashes.  Paths do not end with a forward slash. e.g. `"/a/b/c"`.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling.  Specific errors should be thrown for:
    *   Attempting to create a file or directory that already exists.
    *   Attempting to create a file or directory with a path that violates the path format.
    *   Attempting to delete a non-empty directory.
    *   Attempting to operate on a file or directory that does not exist.
    *   Invalid `replicationFactor` (must be a positive integer).
*   **Efficiency:** The `listFiles` operation must be efficient, especially for directories with a large number of entries. Consider the time complexity of your solution. `findFilesWithReplicationFactor` must also be reasonably efficient.
*   **Concurrency (Implicit):** While you don't need to implement actual concurrency, design your data structures and algorithms with concurrency in mind.  Think about how locks or other synchronization mechanisms *could* be added later if this system were to be truly distributed. This influences your choice of data structures.
*   **Memory Usage:** Be mindful of memory usage.  Avoid storing redundant information.
*   **Scalability:** Consider how your design could scale to handle a large number of files and directories.

**Example:**

```javascript
const dfs = new DistributedFileSystem();

dfs.createDirectory("/home");
dfs.createDirectory("/home/user");
dfs.createFile("/home/user/document.txt", 3);
console.log(dfs.getFileMetadata("/home/user/document.txt")); // Output: { replicationFactor: 3, size: 0 }
dfs.increaseFileSize("/home/user/document.txt", 1024);
console.log(dfs.getFileMetadata("/home/user/document.txt")); // Output: { replicationFactor: 3, size: 1024 }
console.log(dfs.listFiles("/home/user")); // Output: ["document.txt"]
dfs.createDirectory("/home/user/pictures");
console.log(dfs.listFiles("/home/user")); // Output: ["document.txt", "pictures"] (order may vary)
dfs.delete("/home/user/pictures");
console.log(dfs.listFiles("/home/user")); // Output: ["document.txt"]
//dfs.delete("/home/user"); // Should throw an error because /home/user is not empty
dfs.delete("/home/user/document.txt");
dfs.delete("/home/user");
dfs.delete("/home");
console.log(dfs.findFilesWithReplicationFactor(3)); //Output: []
```

This problem requires a combination of data structure design, algorithmic thinking, and attention to detail. Good luck!

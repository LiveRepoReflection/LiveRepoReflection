## Question: Optimal Task Assignment with Dependencies and Limited Resources

**Project Name:** `task-optimizer`

**Question Description:**

You are tasked with optimizing the execution of a set of interdependent tasks on a distributed computing system with limited resources. You have a collection of `N` tasks to execute. Each task `i` has the following properties:

*   `id`: A unique integer identifier for the task (0 to N-1).
*   `resourceRequirements`: An object specifying the resources required to execute the task. This object contains the amount of CPU (`cpu`) and Memory (`memory`) needed.
*   `dependencies`: An array of `id`s representing the tasks that must be completed before this task can begin. A task cannot start until all its dependencies are finished.
*   `estimatedExecutionTime`: An integer representing the estimated time (in seconds) it takes to complete the task.
*   `priority`: An integer representing the priority of the task. Higher values indicate higher priority.

You also have a limited pool of computing resources, described by a `resources` object, specifying total available `cpu` and `memory`.

Your distributed system can execute multiple tasks concurrently, as long as the combined resource requirements of the running tasks do not exceed the total available resources.

Your goal is to design an algorithm that determines the optimal order and schedule for executing these tasks to minimize the **weighted average completion time (WACT)**. The WACT is calculated as follows:

1.  Calculate the completion time for each task (the time at which the task finishes executing).
2.  Multiply each task's completion time by its priority.
3.  Sum the weighted completion times.
4.  Divide the sum by the total number of tasks.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= N <= 1000` (Number of tasks)
*   `1 <= cpu <= 100` (CPU requirement for each task)
*   `1 <= memory <= 100` (Memory requirement for each task)
*   `1 <= resources.cpu <= 500` (Total available CPU)
*   `1 <= resources.memory <= 500` (Total available Memory)
*   `1 <= estimatedExecutionTime <= 100` (Execution time for each task)
*   `1 <= priority <= 10` (Priority for each task)
*   The dependency graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). There are no circular dependencies.
*   You must handle edge cases where tasks cannot be executed due to insufficient resources (even if other tasks are completed).  In such cases, the function should return -1.
*   The solution should be reasonably efficient. Naive approaches might timeout on larger test cases.

**Input:**

*   `tasks`: An array of task objects, as described above.
*   `resources`: An object containing the total available CPU and Memory.

**Output:**

*   Return the minimum possible WACT as a floating-point number. If it is not possible to execute all tasks due to resource constraints, return -1.

**Example:**

```javascript
const tasks = [
  { id: 0, resourceRequirements: { cpu: 10, memory: 20 }, dependencies: [], estimatedExecutionTime: 5, priority: 5 },
  { id: 1, resourceRequirements: { cpu: 20, memory: 30 }, dependencies: [0], estimatedExecutionTime: 10, priority: 10 },
  { id: 2, resourceRequirements: { cpu: 30, memory: 40 }, dependencies: [0, 1], estimatedExecutionTime: 15, priority: 1 },
];

const resources = { cpu: 50, memory: 70 };

// Expected output might be something around 14.166666666666666 (depending on the optimal schedule)
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Greedy Approaches:**  Consider different greedy approaches (e.g., prioritizing tasks with the highest priority-to-resource ratio). Analyze their potential drawbacks and limitations.
*   **Dynamic Programming:** Explore whether dynamic programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal schedule. Consider the state space and how to represent it efficiently.
*   **Resource Management:** Implement a resource management system that tracks available resources and allocates them to tasks.
*   **Topological Sorting:** Use topological sorting to determine a valid execution order based on dependencies.
*   **Backtracking:** If other methods fail, consider backtracking to explore all possible schedules, but be mindful of the time complexity.

This problem challenges you to combine knowledge of graph algorithms, resource allocation, optimization techniques, and careful edge case handling to achieve an efficient and correct solution. Good luck!

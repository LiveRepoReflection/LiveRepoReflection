`DistributedRateLimiter`

## Question Description

You are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed rate limiter service. This service is critical for protecting a backend system from being overwhelmed by excessive requests. The service needs to be horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, and provide strong guarantees about rate limiting accuracy.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are building an e-commerce platform that processes millions of requests daily. One critical service handles order placement. Without proper rate limiting, a malicious user (or a faulty client) could flood the order placement service with requests, potentially causing denial of service (DoS) for legitimate users. You need a distributed rate limiter to prevent this.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Distributed Counting:** The rate limiter must function correctly across multiple instances of the service. A single counter cannot be used.
2.  **Configurable Rate Limits:** The rate limit should be configurable, allowing you to specify the maximum number of requests allowed within a given time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour). The configuration should be easily modifiable without service downtime.
3.  **User-Based Rate Limiting:** The rate limiter should be able to apply rate limits on a per-user basis (identified by a unique user ID).
4.  **Near Real-time Accuracy:** The rate limiter should provide near real-time accuracy. While perfect accuracy is not always achievable in a distributed system, the rate limiter should strive to be as precise as possible, minimizing the risk of under- or over-limiting.
5.  **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be designed to handle node failures gracefully. Data loss should be minimized.
6.  **Scalability:** The rate limiter should be horizontally scalable to handle increasing traffic volumes. Adding more instances should increase the overall capacity of the system.
7.  **Minimal Latency Impact:** The rate limiter must have minimal impact on the overall request latency. The rate limiting check should be as efficient as possible.
8.  **Atomic Operations:** All operations related to rate limiting (e.g., checking and incrementing counters) must be atomic to prevent race conditions.
9.  **Throttling Mechanism:**  When a user exceeds their rate limit, the service should return a specific HTTP status code (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) with a `Retry-After` header indicating when the user can retry their request.
10. **Bonus:** Implement a "leaky bucket" or "token bucket" algorithm for smoothing out bursts of traffic.

**Constraints:**

*   You can use any suitable in-memory data store (e.g., Redis, Memcached) or a more persistent database (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, or even a relational database if you can handle the scaling challenges) to store rate limiting data. Justify your choice.
*   Consider the trade-offs between different consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency vs. strong consistency) and their impact on rate limiting accuracy.
*   Assume a high volume of concurrent requests. Optimize for performance.
*   The system should be designed to prevent a single "hot" user from overwhelming a particular node in the rate limiter cluster.
*   Avoid using external rate-limiting SaaS solutions (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Kong). The goal is to design a custom solution.

**Deliverables:**

Describe your design, including:

*   The data structures you will use to store rate limiting information (e.g., counters, timestamps).
*   The algorithm you will use to check and increment the rate limit (e.g., sliding window, fixed window, token bucket).
*   How you will handle concurrency and atomicity.
*   How you will distribute the rate limiting data across multiple nodes.
*   How you will handle node failures and data consistency.
*   How you will configure and update rate limits.
*   A high-level code implementation of the core rate limiting logic in JavaScript. This should demonstrate how you would check if a request should be allowed or throttled.  Focus on the algorithm and data structure manipulation, not the network communication aspects.
*   A discussion of the trade-offs you made and the limitations of your design.
*   How you would monitor and alert on the rate limiter's performance and accuracy.

This problem requires a deep understanding of distributed systems, data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. Good luck!
